Look for the UL label.,
Look for a convenient way to test the smoke detector.,
Look for a unit that's easy to maintain.,
Look for the ability to turn off the alarm without disabling the unit.,
Consider any special needs you may have.",How to Choose a Smoke Detector," Smoke detectors detect smoke using one or more of the kinds of sensors described below.


Ionization alarms work by ionizing the air inside the smoke alarm with trace amounts of a radioactive element, americium 241. This sets up an electric current within the smoke detector. Smoke particles entering the ionization chamber disrupt the current, triggering the alarm. Ionization alarms are better at detecting the tinier smoke particles from fires that ignite quickly, such as paper and grease fires or fires caused by arsonists. Some ionization smoke alarms are integrated with carbon monoxide detectors.
Photoelectric alarms use a small pulsating (strobe) light; smoke particles entering the detection chamber diffract the light onto a sensor to trigger the alarm. Photoelectric alarms are better at detecting the larger smoke particles from slow, smoldering fires, such as electrical fires or those in bedding, clothing, or upholstery. They are usually more costly than ionization alarms, but they are less susceptible to being triggered accidentally.
Dual-sensor smoke alarms incorporate both ionization and photoelectric sensor components. They are the most costly but provide the best smoke detection for home use. (You can also buy both separate ionization and photoelectric smoke detectors and use them together.)
Another type of smoke detector, the air-sampling smoke detector, uses a sensor in a network of pipes through which air is circulated, to determine whether smoke from a fire is present. They are similar to ionization alarms but more sensitive and geared for business and scientific environments (warehouses and laboratories) where a higher degree of smoke sensing is called for.;
, Many smoke detectors run on 9-volt, AA, or AAA batteries, which must be replaced periodically. (Manufacturers suggest replacing the batteries once a year, when you adjust your clocks to go on or off Daylight Savings Time.) Some smoke alarms are equipped with lithium batteries designed to last for the 10-year life of the unit, while others are designed to be wired into household current and have backup batteries that kick in when the power goes out.

, You should plan to install a smoke alarm in each room of the house, including the basement and attic. Also plan to put a smoke detector in each hallway that leads to a bedroom, as well as in the bedroom itself, and at either end of a stairway. If you have a large house, consider getting a smoke alarm system where the individual smoke detectors are wired together so that when 1 detects smoke, they all sound. (These units usually have to be wired into household current and, thus, have to be professionally installed.)


Although using both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms is recommended, you may want to use only photoelectric smoke detectors around the kitchen stove or toaster, as the more sensitive ionization detectors may be set off by cooking smoke.

, Smoke detectors that bear the ""UL"" in a circle logo on their housing, packaging, or user manual have been tested and certified by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. Underwriters Laboratories not only tests and certifies products before release but also conducts follow-up testing to ensure products continue to meet their standards.

, Smoke alarms should be tested on a monthly basis to make sure they're working properly. Most smoke detectors have a test button on the unit to verify that they work, but if you aren't comfortable climbing on a ladder to test the alarm, choose a smoke detector that can be tested with the infrared signal from a remote control unit.

, Smoke detectors should be vacuumed once a month to remove dirt that can block their sensors or trigger false alarms. Hinged or removable covers can make vacuuming easier. Also, some smoke alarms feature slide out battery drawers to make inserting new batteries easy.

, If you can't shut the smoke alarm off when it sounds a false alarm, you may be tempted to take out the batteries and not put them back in when you need to have the smoke alarm work.

, Some smoke detectors come with options or add-on equipment to supplement the audio alarm, such as a visual alert system for the hearing-impaired. (This option is usually available only as part of a network smoke detection system, however.)"

Inspect your home.,
Check the condition of your home's electrical system.,
Check the natural gas/LP gas system in your home.,
Check the air conditioning and heating unit in your home.",How to Prevent a House Fire1," You may need to recruit, or even hire, someone experienced in home electrical wiring, plumbing (gas), heating, and air conditioning to ensure that it is thoroughly inspected. You can also do the checks outlined in the following steps.;
,


Look for improperly grounded receptacles. Many modern appliances require a ""three pronged"" (grounded) receptacle, but people will sometimes use an adapter to bypass this safety feature, or even break a ground prong off an appliance cord. Changing existing circuits to provide grounding is a job that is best left to a professional electrician.
Look in the attic and crawl spaces for wiring which has been damaged by pests or insects. Some old wiring is insulated with a material which insects eat or chew on, and squirrels or other rodents will often chew the thermoplastic insulation off of modern nonmetallic cable (Romex).
Look for overloaded circuit breakers, panel boxes, or fuse boxes. Check for breakers or fuses which may have circuits ""piggy-backed"" on them. These are rated for single circuit protection, but sometimes in outdated or undersized panel boxes, people will put two or even more wires in the terminal of a single breaker or fuse.
Notice flickering lights, or intermittent power surges. These conditions may be caused by outside influences, but if they occur often, they may indicate a bad connection or a short in the circuit.
Note breakers which trip, or fuses that blow frequently. This is almost always a sign of an overloaded circuit or other wiring problem, usually of a most serious nature.
Look at the individual breaker connections, especially in outdoor panel boxes, for corrosion, signs of thermal damage (smut or smokey residue near terminals) splices which are poorly taped or wire nutted, or abraded or damaged wire insulation.
Check the ground cable. A failure in the building grounding system and bonding can be dangerous in regard to electrical shock, as well as fire. Look for loose split bolts, clamps, or other connecting devices, and corrosion.
Be especially careful to notice any connections in wiring other than copper. Installed correctly, and with tight connections, aluminum wire is not excessively dangerous, but when connections are made to copper wires, an electrolytic reaction may occur, causing increased resistance in the connection which will generate excessive heat. If you are able to apply an antioxidant compound to aluminum connections, it will help decrease the risk of oxidation causing a short circuit at these locations.

, You will want to look for loose fittings, leaking valves, faulty pilot lights, and debris or improperly stored flammable materials in areas near these appliances.


Check the vent stacks on gas water heaters, furnaces, and clothes dryers.
Check the automatic ignition systems or pilot lights on these fixtures, as well, particularly for any guards which are not properly installed, and for lint or dust buildup in the immediate area around them.
Have the gas plumbing (pipes), valves, and regulators inspected by a professional any time you smell gas or suspect a leak.

, These systems operate with electric motors and air moving equipment which requires periodic maintenance.


Clean, or have your interior AC coils cleaned, and replace your return air filters regularly. This will prevent the fan motor from being overworked, and also save money on your energy bill. For window air conditioners, never use extension cords!
Lubricate belt drive pulleys (where applicable), boss bearings on drive motors, and other equipment as needed.
Have the resistance coils or furnace burners cleaned and serviced at the beginning of the heating season, since debris may accumulate there while the system is off during the summer.
Listen to the system when it is operating. Squealing sounds, rumbling noises, or banging and tapping sounds may indicate loose parts or bearings which are seizing up.
If you have access to a snap-on amp meter, you may check the amperage draw on the high amperage circuit to your heating coils to make sure they are in the normal operating range. Higher than normal amperage draw on a circuit indicates unusual resistance, and in an electrical circuit, resistance is what causes heat, and ultimately, fires.

Dress warmly.,
Gather the right tools.,
Clear a path to your vehicle.,
Start at the top.,
Clear the doors.,
Shovel snow away from the tires.,
Dig out your tailpipe.,
Check under the hood.,
Start the car.,
Clear the windshield and windows.,
Dig out a path to drive away.",How to Dig out Your Car After a Snow Storm," You may be out in the cold for a while to complete this task so be sure to wear warm clothes. You’ll need a waterproof jacket, pants, and boots. Wear gloves to keep your hands warm, as well as a hat to maintain your body temperature.


Wear layers in case you get too warm from the exertion and need to remove an article of clothing.
Getting wet can not only make you quite cold, it can also lead to frostbite. Be sure all your outer layers are waterproof!;
, You’ll need a shovel for clearing the area around your car as well as a broom with soft bristles to clear the snow off your car without damaging the paint. You should also bring an ice scraper to clean your windshield and windows.If you have a snowblower, bring it to make the job a bit easier.
You may also want to bring a stepladder if your vehicle is taller than you are, in order to clear snow from the roof.
Having lock de-icer on hand is a good idea in case your door locks are frozen shut.
Salt can be handy to help melt the snow and ice around your tires, so consider bringing that with you as well.

, You’ll want firm footing as well as a place to put the snow you remove from your car. Clearing a path first will make the job easier.


You could also wait until snow plows come through and clear the area, although sometimes they push more snow along the side of a road where cars may be parked.

, Clear the roof of snow first. Clear the hood and trunk areas as well before moving to the tires and road. Starting at the top ensures you only have to shovel the ground once; if you shovel snow from the ground then clear off the car, you’ll have to shovel the ground again to clear the snow you removed from the car.Though it may seem easier to leave snow on top of your car, it creates a hazard. Snow and ice can fall down over the windshield while driving which can block your view.
If your vehicle is taller than you are, use a small stepladder and a broom to push off the snow. Be sure not to push the snow into the street, as this could create difficulty when you are ready to drive away.
Shovel the removed snow well away from the car, other cars, and pedestrian walkways. The intention is to clean your car without creating more snow hazards.

, Dig snow away from the doors, especially the driver’s door. This will enable you to get into the car and start it, which will help melt snow and ice from the windows and other areas., Remove snow from underneath as well as in the front and in the back of your tires.Be sure that there aren’t any chunks of ice or icicles anchoring your tires to the ground, as that will prevent you from easily driving out of the spot. If ice is present, try to knock it down with your broom.


You can also put salt down around your tires to help melt the ice and snow. Be sure not to get it on your car, as it is corrosive.

, Clearing your tailpipe is a must; use your shovel to remove snow that has built up around the tailpipe and the back of your car. Leave at least 1 ft (0.31 m) of room to allow the exhaust fumes to escape. Otherwise, exhaust backs up into the car and can cause fatal carbon monoxide poisoning.Ensure the area around your tailpipe is clear before starting your car.

, After a major blizzard, snow may have filled the engine compartment. If so, prop the hood open, remove the snow, and leave the hood open to let everything dry off. Also check your windshield washer outlets to make sure they are clear as you may need to clean your windows often during winter driving.

, Turn on the heat and all defrosters. This will help melt snow and ice as well as give you a place to warm up once you are done digging.Turn on your headlights to help melt the snow and ice from the lenses. Leave the engine running and the heat and defrosters on while you finish removing the ice from the windshield and windows.Ensure you have enough gasoline to let the car idle while you are removing the rest of snow and still reach your destination.
If you don’t have a key fob and your locks are frozen, use lock de-icer if you have it. If not, you could try heating up your key with a lighter or matches before inserting it into the lock. Be careful not to burn your hands or gloves! Don’t force the lock, or you may end up needing a locksmith., Do this after you start your car so the heat and defrosters make the job a bit easier. Use an ice scraper to clear the windshield, side windows, side mirrors, back window and any parts of the roof and hood that are not yet free of ice.Do not pour warm water on the windshield as this can cause the glass to crack!
You should also free up the wipers, if they are frozen.
Remove snow and ice from your headlights and taillights as well.

, Clear any large piles of snow or ice that will get in the way of you driving your car away from the spot you were parked in. Use a low gear and a low speed to help you move the car away from the spot.You may want to put salt, sand, or cat litter around your tires to help you gain traction when attempting to drive away. The gritty material is easier for your tires to grab onto than snow and ice.
Rock your car or get a push to help you gain momentum. If no one is around to help you push the car, you can alternate between reverse and drive to get the car moving. Be sure to let the engine return to neutral before shifting gears."
"
Avoid being caught in your car.,
Follow the remaining steps if you have no choice but to remain with your car during a fire front.

,
Roll up all of the car windows and close all of the air vents.,
If you are moving still, drive slowly and very carefully.,
When you stop driving, park behind a solid structure if possible.,
Get down on the floor as low as possible.,
Stay in the vehicle until the main fire passes.,
Get out of the car once the fire front has passed.Immediately attend to children and anyone experiencing distress or shock.",How to Survive a Wildfire While Trapped in a Vehicle," This is the safest possible action because a car offers no protection from radiant heat.Staying in your car during a fire is a dangerous measure, to be used only in an emergency if you are caught in the fire with absolutely no other alternative. While it may be safer than trying to run from the fire on foot, the degree of fire intensity will impact your survival chances--if it is a grass fire, you might be fine but if it is inferno-like, your chances of survival are slim. Kevin Tolhurst, a ""fire behavior specialist"" from the University of Melbourne, warns that a car is a very bad place to be in during an intense fire because the small volume heats up too quickly. It is therefore recommended that:


If you have time to flee a fire (from your home, place of work, etc.), use that time to be ahead of the fire, so that you won't be caught by it while driving. Make the decision to stay or leave well in advance of being forced to make the choice.
If you can shelter in your home or a building, prefer doing so over staying in your car.;
,, Put the air-conditioning on recirculation. Leave the engine running, even when you stop.,


Keep the headlights and hazards lights on. Visibility will be considerably reduced.
Watch for other vehicles and pedestrians. Collisions and injuries are a major hazard in low visibility; people may be panicking and possibly running on the road.
Watch for fleeing livestock and wildlife.
Use your horn if you are worried that people or animals are nearby but you cannot see them.

, This will help to block radiant heat, which is the killer heat.If you cannot find a solid structure to take the heat, stop the car in a clear area, beside the road or in a similar suitable place. Be sure that you are nowhere near overhanging trees and branches, near combustible material that may ignite, or anything else that will burn fiercely.

, Keep below window level.


Cover up with a woolen blanket or coat. Do not use synthetics as these will melt and cause severe burns. Cover children and reassure them before covering yourself.
If you have water, drink it. If you have enough to spare, wet a small cloth to breathe through.

, While the fire front is crossing, resist the temptation to get out and run. Expect the following possibilities:


Engine may stall and not restart.
Air currents may rock the car.
Some smoke and sparks may enter the vehicle.
The temperature inside the car will increase. This temperature increase may be unbearable and you, or others in the car, are at risk of passing out.
Keep reassuring others in the vehicle if you have the energy (remember that the fire will make hearing difficult). Everyone will be scared, and some may go into shock. If anyone panics, you will need to calm them quickly and help them resist the temptation to flee.

,


If you have a cell phone, call for help immediately.
If the car is still operational, drive it away from the fire to safety.
If the car is no longer working, or continues to burn, walk away from the fire and seek help. Keep well clear of burning trees (widow makers) which can drop branches and injure or kill you.

"
Check your appliances.,
Be very careful with space heaters.,
Avoid using extension cords for air conditioners.,
Maintain your fireplace correctly.,
Keep flammable liquids away from ignition sources.,
Be very careful in any situation where you use an extension cord for extended periods of time.",How to Prevent a House Fire2,"


Keep your stove and oven clean, especially watching for grease accumulation.
Check stove vent hoods, clean the filter regularly, and make sure that if it is equipped with an exterior vent, insects or birds do not build nests or otherwise impede the air flow through it.
Check the power cords for your appliances. Look for missing grounding prongs on the plugs and damaged insulation, and replace or repair them if defects are found.
Keep the lint trap and outside vent clean in your clothes dryer. Some dryers have internal ductwork which may become clogged and require servicing, so if the dryer is operating poorly, have it checked. Lint or other material collecting near the heat coils in clothes dryers is extremely dangerous. Stay nearby while using the dryer. Have a smoke alarm and fire extinguisher nearby. If you must leave the area for a minute, turn off the dryer. After all, you are not going to be away long, and you can immediately turn the dryer on when you return.

,


Keep flammable materials (curtains, the couch) a safe distance (usually 3 feet) from portable heaters.
Set heaters where they are not in the traffic flow of the room.
As a rule, extension cords are not recommended with space heaters. Small, low wattage heaters may be an exception, but check the manufacturer's recommendations prior to using an extension cord with one. Be safe, just don't use extension cords.
Use space heaters only on solid, firm surfaces. They should never be placed on tables, chairs or other places where they may tip over. Replace old space heaters with ones that will automatically turn off if tipped over.
Do not drape fabric over lamps to dim them. Either buy a lower wattage bulb, or turn the lamp off.

, An overheated cord is like an out-of-control electric heater.

,


Inspect the fire box (hearth) for cracks, damaged sheet metal (for inserts) and other hazards.
Use glass fire doors or a wire mesh spark screen to prevent embers from popping out of the fireplace.
Burn dry, seasoned wood to prevent creosote buildup in the chimney. Note that some woods, like cedar, pop excessively when burned, and should not be used in an open fireplace.
Remove ash and unscorched wood only when there are no embers or sparks in the fire box. Place ash in a metal (not a plastic bucket) and place outside away from any buildings.
Have your chimney inspected and cleaned at least once a year.

,


Keep gasoline, paint thinners, and other highly flammable liquids or materials in UL approved containers and out of the house.
Do not store any flammable liquid in a garage or utility room with that has a pilot light equipped appliance in use in it. Be safe, keep these items outdoors, or in a separate outbuilding.

, Often, foot traffic, moving furniture, and other hazards damage these cords, causing a potential for a fire. Holiday decorations are often lit for weeks with these cords, and if you are using them, use a high quality cord with a sufficient rating for the intended purpose.

Stay in the kitchen when using the range for cooking.,
Don't cook when drinking alcohol, using drugs, or very tired.,
Ensure tea cloths, tea towels dish rags etc are never left on the hob or burner.",How to Prevent a House Fire3," If you are leaving for just a minute, turn off all the burners on the range. Going to the basement for a can of tomatoes, or running out to check the mail, going to the bathroom, answering the phone in another part of the house? Simply turn off all the burners. After all, you are just leaving for a minute. You can immediately turn the pot or frying pan back on when you return. Taking this simple step will prevent one of the most common situations that cause house fires: unattended cooking.


When cooking with oil, keep a lid or flat cookie sheet close by. If flames appear, simply suffocate the fire with the lid and immediately turn off the stove or fryer to let it cool down. Do not try to move the pan. Do not use water. The super-heated water will explode into steam, and can cause severe burns, and oil can splash and spread the fire.

, Eat something already prepared, make a cold sandwich, and go to sleep. Cook your meal later, when you are fully conscious.

, Never hang towels etc where they may fail onto a flame or hot surface.

"
"
Don't sit or lie down when smoking.,
Take care when drying laundry on airers or dryers by the fire.,
Be careful with candles, oil lamps, and other open flame illumination or decorations.,
Use caution with holiday decorations, particularly Christmas trees.,
After using matches, quickly place in or run under water to extinguish any invisible flame or heat source that could cause a fire in the trash can.

,
Take care using chargers for devices such as mobile phones.,
Unplug hair straighteners, curling irons and other similar appliances after use.",How to Prevent a House Fire4," Standing up will usually prevent you from falling asleep while smoking. Getting too tired? Put out the cigarette thoroughly in an ashtray or water-damp sink and go to bed. Do not smoke in bed - when you're in bed it's easy to fall asleep and drop your cigarette on the floor allowing it to set fire to the carpet. Cleaning out the ashtray? Place the ashes in the sink and dampen them, then scoop them up and place them in the trash can away from the house.

, Try not to do this unless totally unavoidable. Dry clothes by radiators, or outdoors if possible.

, Cover the flame with a wire cage to prevent something from falling or blowing onto the flame, and to prevent children and pets from coming in contact with the flame. Extinguish any naked flames when leaving the room, if even for a minute. After all, you'll be right back, and you can immediately relight the candle or lamp.

, Natural Christmas trees are highly combustible when they become dry, and old, damaged, or low quality tree lights cause many fires when combined with an under watered or otherwise dry tree. Watch a video of a Christmas tree fire. It is amazing how fast it can destroy a room, and a home.

,, Unplug chargers when not in use.

, Don't just turn them off at the socket or switch the device itself off, unplug it.

"
"
Do not pile up lawn clippings near a building.,
Be careful using a grill on a deck.",How to Prevent a House Fire5," Fermenting lawn clippings can create heat, and catch on fire. Barn fires start this way from bales of hay with no electricity; house fires have been started from a pile of lawn clippings.

, Decks are flammable. Place non-flammable pads under your grill. Have a fire extinguisher readily available. Stay with your grill while cooking. Turn off propane if leaving, if even for a minute. After all, you'll be right back and can turn on the propane again.

"
"
Crate train dogs.,
Confine new cats to a safe room, a small room with no places for the cat to crawl into to hide (such as into the refrigerator motor), and no electrical cords.",How to Prevent a House Fire6," Use the crates when you are not home and when you're not awake, to prevent new dogs or puppies from chewing on electrical cords. This will also prevent pets from urinating on electrical objects and starting a fire.

, Use the safe room until the cat is calm and no longer hiding. Provide cats with edible oat or wheat grass, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords.


Confine rabbits, chinchillas, and other pets when not supervising them, to prevent them from chewing on electrical cords, causing burns or electrical fires.

"
"
Be ready for an emergency evacuation.,
Determine your community's ability to respond to wildfire.,
Create a 30-foot safety zone around the house.,
Create a second zone at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around the house.,
Clear all combustibles within 30 feet (9.1 m) of any structure.,
Remove debris from under sun decks and porches.,
Enclose eaves and overhangs.,
Cover house vents with wire mesh.,
Install spark arrestors in chimneys and stovepipes.,
Use fire resistant siding.,
Choose safety glass for windows and sliding glass doors.,
Prepare for water storage; develop an external water supply such as a small pond, well or pool.,
Keep the following guidelines in mind at the time of construction or remodeling:


Choose locations wisely; canyon and slope locations increase the risk of exposure to wildland fires.",How to Prepare for a Wildfire1," Evacuation may be the only way to protect your family in a wildfire. Know where to go and what to bring with you. You should plan several escape routes in case roads are blocked by a wildfire.



Make a disaster plan for your family.

Prepare your family for an emergency evacuation.

Prepare an emergency plan for your pets.;
, Are roads leading to your property clearly marked? Are the roads wide enough to allow firefighting equipment to get through? Is your house number visible from the roadside?

, All vegetation is fuel for a wildfire, though some trees and shrubs are more flammable than others. To reduce the risk, you will need to modify or eliminate brush, trees and other vegetation near your home. The greater the distance is between your home and the vegetation, the greater the protection. If you live on a hill, extend the zone on the downhill side. Fire spreads rapidly uphill. The steeper the slope, the more open space you will need to protect your home. Swimming pools and patios can be a safety zone and stone walls can act as heat shields and deflect flames. In this zone, you should also do the following:


Remove vines from the walls of the house.
Move shrubs and other landscaping away from the sides of the house.
Prune branches and shrubs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of chimneys and stove pipes.
Remove tree limbs within 15 feet (4.6 m) of the ground.
Thin a 15-foot space between tree crowns.
Replace highly flammable vegetation such as pine, eucalyptus, junipers and fir trees with lower growing, less flammable species. Check with your local fire department or garden store for suggestions.
Replace vegetation that has living or dead branches from the ground-level up (these act as ladder fuels for the approaching fire).

Cut the lawn often keeping the grass at a maximum of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Watch grass and other vegetation near the driveway, a source of ignition from automobile exhaust systems.
Clear the area of leaves, brush, evergreen cones, dead limbs and fallen trees.

, This zone should begin about 30 feet (9.1 m) from the house and extend to at least 100 feet (30.5 m). In this zone, focus solely on reducing or replacing as much of the most flammable vegetation as possible. If you live on a hill, you may need to extend the zone for several hundred feet to provide the desired level of safety.

,


Install electrical lines underground, if possible
Ask the power company to clear branches from power lines.
Avoid using bark and wood chip mulch

Stack firewood 100 feet (30.5 m) away and uphill from any structure.






Store combustible or flammable materials in approved safety containers and keep them away from the house.
Keep the gas grill and propane tank at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from any structure. Clear an area 15 feet (4.6 m) around the grill. Place a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) mesh screen over the grill. Always use the grill cautiously but refrain from using it all during high risk times.

, Any porch, balcony or overhang with exposed space underneath is fuel for an approaching fire. Overhangs ignite easily by flying embers and by the heat and fire that get trapped underneath. If vegetation is allowed to grow underneath or if the space is used for storage, the hazard is increased significantly. Clear leaves, trash and other combustible materials away from underneath sun decks and porches. Extend 1/2-inch mesh screen from all overhangs down to the ground. Enclose wooden stilts with non-combustible material such as concrete, brick, rock, stucco or metal. Use non-combustible patio furniture and covers. If you're planning a porch or sun deck, use non-combustible or fire-resistant materials. If possible, build the structure to the ground so that there is no space underneath.

, Like porches and balconies, eaves trap the heat rising along the exterior siding. Enclose all eaves to reduce the hazard.

, Any attic vent, soffit vent, louver or other opening can allow embers and flaming debris to enter a home and ignite it. Cover all openings with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or smaller corrosion-resistant wire mesh. If you're designing louvers, place them in the vertical wall rather than the soffit of the overhang.

, Chimneys create a hazard when embers escape through the top. To prevent this, install spark arrestors on all chimneys, stovepipes and vents for fuel-burning heaters. Use spark arrestors made of 12-gauge welded or woven wire mesh screen with openings 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) across. Ask your fire department for exact specifications. If you're building a chimney, use non-combustible materials and make sure the top of the chimney is at least two feet higher than any obstruction within 10 feet (3.0 m) of the chimney. Keep the chimney clean.

, Use fire resistant materials in the siding of your home, such as stucco, metal, brick, cement shingles, concrete and rock. You can treat wood siding with UL-approved fire retardant chemicals, but the treatment and protection are not permanent.

, Windows allow radiated heat to pass through and ignite combustible materials inside. The larger the pane of glass, the more vulnerable it is to fire. Dual- or triple-pane thermal glass, and fire resistant shutters or drapes, help reduce the wildfire risk. You can also install non-combustible awnings to shield windows and use shatter-resistant glazing such as tempered or wireglass.

, This will serve as a temporary water source if the water is shut off. See our articles on building water features.

,
Use fire-resistant materials when building, renovating, or retrofitting structures.
Avoid designs that include wooden decks and patios.
Use non-combustible materials for the roof. The roof is especially vulnerable in a wildfire. Embers and flaming debris can travel great distances, land on your roof and start a new fire. Avoid flammable roofing materials such as wood, shake and shingle. Materials that are more fire resistant include single ply membranes, fiberglass shingles, slate, metal, clay and concrete tile. Clear gutters of leaves and debris.
You should also contact your local fire department, forestry office, emergency management office or building department for information about local fire laws, building codes and protection measures. Obtain local building codes and weed abatement ordinances for structures built near wooded areas.

, If you have gas-powered pumps for water, make sure they are fueled and ready. This may help firefighters put out fires in your home.

,,, Disconnect any automatic garage door openers so that doors can still be opened by hand if the power goes out.

, Any pets still with you should also be put in the car.

,, It may be necessary for firefighters to gain quick entry into your home to fight fire.

Analyze the specific local problem and collect related data.,
Build a partnership between fire and emergency services, the police and other law enforcement agencies, and the residents.,
Assess the needs of a given neighborhood and in the case of arson, how the fire and police departments can work with the residents.,
Set up a Neighborhood Watch program by choosing and training a dynamic group of volunteers that are led by organized and motivated leaders.,
Develop meaningful projects specific to the identified problem.",How to Prevent Arson in Your Community1," Strategies that address the problems in a given area must be mapped out. From the outset, it is essential to facilitate neighbors working together. This effort provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet and get to know each other, something that has become less common lately. Yet, it is crucial to include neighborhood involvement for the process to be successful.


In addition to not being familiar with your neighbors, the dilemma is compounded by the fact that many adults in vulnerable neighborhoods work multiple jobs frequently with odd hours, making it extraordinarily difficult to schedule meetings and organize events. This environment also makes it challenging for neighbors to get to know and care about one another in a way that would encourage them to watch out for each other but you need to find compromises to get them together, even if it's a series of meetings at different times.





;
, This is often the most difficult step to hurdle because there is usually angst between the residents and law enforcement for the existing crime problem that exists in their community.

, Neighborhood Watch in the USA states, “In many cases, law enforcement and community members do not have the same focus. For instance, law enforcement may be focusing their attention on a problem that the neighborhood is not concerned about, such as attempting to address major crimes throughout the city. On the other hand, community members may be more concerned about crimes such as bicycle thefts or graffiti, which are considered minor from a police standpoint.” An effective Neighborhood Arson Watch program will combine the needs of the fire and police departments with those of the neighborhood when determining which problems to focus on and the methods used to address them.

, If the group leaders are devoid of motivation and organization, the volunteers may be uninspired to participate and will quickly quit out of disappointment and frustration. Select the leaders wisely and give the leaders reasons to be proud of their role.

, Often, after a Neighborhood Watch has addressed its original issue, members lose interest. It is important for leaders to remain passionate and committed for the long term. One way to accomplish this is to design new projects so that there is always a goal towards which the team of volunteers is aspiring. Arson prevention projects should focus on identifying and removing what could burn or materials that an arsonist could use to start a fire, such as:


Clean up the neighborhood by removing all garbage, material, and excess vegetation that is capable of being ignited.






Remove all possible sources of ignition such as flammable liquids and unused gas containers.






Remove abandoned vehicles. According to the USFA’s NFIRS data and the NFPA, there is an annual estimated average of 25,328 intentional fires involving vehicles.Most car fires are started to cover up other criminal activity or simply as an act of vandalism. An abandoned car is a target for arson.






Secure abandoned and vacant homes which are potential arson targets. This may be comprised with additional locks or the boarding up of broken windows or other openings with plywood. Communicate with the owner that authorities are concerned about the vacant home and explain why.






Encourage the fire department to conduct frequent fire code inspections.






Contact public works to disconnect all utilities at the street. This includes natural gas, water, and electricity. If there are liquefied petroleum gas tanks, they should be disconnected and removed.






Encourage Neighborhood Watch members to patrol these areas and write down descriptions, license plates of suspicious vehicles, and potential suspect descriptions.

Decide in advance the destination of your egress.,
Decide on the route to your safe location, as well as an alternate path.,
Be prepared to spend at least 12 hours on the road.,
Purchase two large gasoline cans long before you might ever need them.,
During hurricane season, always keep your car's gas tank at least half full.,
Purchase plywood and hardware for covering windows and doors before you leave.,
Make a checklist of everything you need to do before you leave.",How to Evacuate from a Hurricane1," This decision should be made as soon as possible, and is best if made even well before the hurricane season. Hotels and motels may be sold out everywhere within 300 miles (480 km) of the evacuation point, making it really important to have somewhere established to evacuate to (for example, a friend's or relative's house in a nearby state, etc.). Make plans to evacuate with friends or family in advance as well.


Have an agreement that, if an evacuation appears imminent, both parties will attempt to contact each other. Phone lines may be too jammed to complete a call but you might be able to leave a message online or through some other means, so be sure to make arrangements to check these different messaging possibilities. Above all, agree that they should expect your arrival anyway even if there is no message or contact.
Review hurricane maps provided by local authorities. These will detail major routes and shelter locations and you should be able to pinpoint the evacuation routes and resources most apt to your own situation.;
, Major highways will inevitably be backed up for miles. Find an alternative, winding path if one is available. You may and most likely will find it necessary. Having GPS can be helpful in this instance but also have road maps with you in case the GPS hasn't covered everything or it doesn't work.

, Ensure you have enough to eat, drink, and stay entertained, as well as allowing ample time for restroom breaks. Failing to prepare for hours on the road can turn gloomy trip into a nightmare!


If you have children, be sure to have their favorite toys, games and books as well as some sleeping items such as blankets and pillows. If you have a portable DVD player, this can be a good way to pass a few hours and older children can bring along portable game machines (be sure to also bring along the car charger).
If you have pets, make sure to have their necessities with them, and never leave them in the car unattended if you need to stop. The articles How to Prepare Your Pets for Disaster and How to Prepare an Emergency Plan For Your Pets go into greater detail on how to plan for your pets.

, Gasoline cans will become impossible to find when the storm approaches. Keep one can empty and another can full, then store them in a locked trunk for safekeeping.


If you live on an island and plan to leave by ferry, do not use or fill any gas cans until you have left the island. In most cases, you will not be allowed to ride the ferry with them. However, be sure to bring them empty and fill as soon as possible.
Only use approved gasoline containers to hold gas. Not doing so can be a safety hazard.

, If a storm is approaching (before an evacuation order), top it off every day.

, If you have a way to store these supplies, purchase them as soon as possible. Hardware and lumber stores will become swamped by crowds as the hurricane approaches. You could even have your plywood fitted for each window in advance.


Store hurricane lumber somewhere safe from moisture, such as in a shed or hanging from a dry wall.

, This should include notifying who you will be residing with, turning off the breakers and gas main, gathering your pets (or doing whatever you plan to do with them), gathering clothing, food, medications, etc.


If you complete none of the other steps above, complete this one. When the time comes to evacuate, having a checklist will save you time, prevent panic and allow you to leave knowing that everything has been taken care of.

The burning of a place of worship is a stressful event; it not only devastates the affected congregation but wounds the entire community.,
Implement external security:


Illuminate the exterior and entrances.,
Provide internal security:


Use properly installed deadbolt locks on all exterior doors.,
Establish and maintain community awareness:


Keep congregation leaders informed of potential and existing problems.",How to Prevent Arson in Your Community3," Whether the motivation behind the arson is hate or reckless vandalism, a congregation views it as an attack on their life and beliefs. As with any arson prevention program, there are three factors which need to be addressed for places of worship: external security, internal security, and community awareness.

,






Use motion-activated lighting near doors and windows.






Keep shrubbery and trees trimmed so the building can be observed by passing patrols.






If in a rural setting, ensure crops are far enough away to allow proper illumination of the area.






Do not allow church signs to block the view of the building.






Many buildings have basement entries that are hidden from view. These should be secured with locking, ground-level doors when the building is not in use.






Ladders, external stairways, and fire escapes allowing access to the roof should be secured.






Painting the building white or constructing it with light-colored brick makes a human figure more readily seen at night.






Consider fencing the areas or sides that are not readily visible to patrols or neighbors.







,






Windows that can be opened should have adequate locks on them.






Consider decorative or wrought iron protection for windows. (Windows used as emergency exits must still be able to be opened in an emergency.) Doors should have similar protection.






Installation of a combination burglar and fire alarm with a phone dialer should be considered.






If there is a private security firm in your area, consider a contract with them as they will check the building at unscheduled intervals.






Keep a current list of all individuals that have access to keys and change locks periodically.







,






Be aware of individuals who may be disgruntled or likely to cause damage to property through arson or vandalism.






Be aware that vandalism may precede arson!






Open avenues of communication with fire and law enforcement officials regarding the arson problem places of worship are facing.






Appoint a person from the congregation to be a liaison with law and fire officials.






Promote neighborhood watches and educate the neighbors with the lighting arrangements (motion lights, etc.).






Educate neighbors on how to recognize and report unusual activities.






Encourage neighbors to make note of strangers spending time in the neighborhood, either on foot or in vehicles.






Write down the license plate numbers of suspicious vehicles and inform the proper authorities swiftly.






Do not advertise on signs or bulletins when the place of worship will not be in use.

When a school is damaged by fire, the effects are wider reaching than the damage to the building.,
Deter unauthorized entry into the school by posting visible signs, and while the school is closed, ensure the building is well lit, as most crimes occur under the cover of darkness.

,
Storage facilities and sheds used to hold sports equipment should also be well lit and located at least 10 feet (3.0 m) from the main building to avoid fire spread from these buildings involving the whole school.

,
Reduce the opportunity for an arsonist to start a fire by eliminating easily combustible and flammable materials located outside the school buildings.,
Many schools have temporary classrooms or trailers.,
Block narrow spaces or alleys between buildings which provide cover to arsonists with an immovable barrier or fence.

,
Test and maintain all smoke alarms, automatic extinguishing systems, fire-rated doors, and lighting for evacuation, and continue fire drills.

",How to Prevent Arson in Your Community4," Arson results in major distress to students and staff along with disrupted and lost class educational time affecting learning, exams, and educational advancement. Teachers lose valuable teaching tools and resources that they have built up over their career. Schools are the heart of a local community and it is crucial to make sure they are safe. By taking some basic precautions in working practices, it is possible to minimize the risk of fire:

,,, This includes the removal or locking up of garbage bins and recyclable materials.

, These buildings should be fit with covers or skirts at the base to prevent combustible materials being placed underneath buildings and ignited.

Go through your checklist.,
Monitor television and/or radio broadcasts.,
Keep your car's tank as full as possible.",How to Evacuate from a Hurricane2," If you have made this checklist in advance, evacuating will be much easier, as you will have already made all the key decisions.

, Important information regarding evacuation procedures and weather updates may change quickly.

, Gasoline may be impossible to find on the road. Fill your spare gasoline cans as soon as possible (if you have to make a ferry crossing, wait until after the crossing; federal regulations do not allow gas cans with fuel on board). Try to keep your gas tank at least half full while you are evacuating to avoid getting stuck in long, monotonous gas lines.

React as soon as you hear your smoke alarm go off.,
Safely exit through doors.,
Protect yourself from smoke inhalation.,
Stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch fire.,
Ward off the smoke if you can't get out.,
Call for help from a second story window.,
Escape from a second story window if you can.",How to Keep Safe During a House Fire1," If you hear your smoke detector or alarm going off and see fire, try to exit your home as safely as possible. Do not try to grab your phone, valuables, or your other important possessions. Your only concern is to get out of there as fast as possible. Nothing else is as important as this. You should be getting yourself and your family members out safely. If it's nighttime, yell loudly to get everyone up. You may only have a few seconds to escape safely, so ignore all secondary concerns that have nothing to do with staying alive.;
, If you see smoke under a door, then you cannot go out that door, because smoke is toxic and fire is sure to follow. If you don't see smoke, put the back of your hand up to the door to make sure it doesn't feel hot. If the door feels cool, then open it slowly and pass through it. If your door is open and there is a fire preventing you from exiting the room, close the door to protect yourself from the fire.


If the door is hot or there's smoke under it and there are no other doors to pass through, you will have to try to escape through a window.

, Get low to the floor and crouch or crawl on your hands and knees to evade the smoke. Though you may think that running is faster, encourage your family members to crouch or crawl, too. Smoke inhalation causes people to become disoriented and can even render a person unconscious. Knowing this, you should cover your nose and mouth if you have to walk by or through a heavily smoke-filled room.You can also place a shirt or a wet rag over your nose and mouth, but only if you have time. This will only buy you a minute or so, which is not a lot of time, but it does help to filter those products of combustion which lead to smoke inhalation.

, If your clothes catch fire, immediately stop what you're doing, drop flat to the ground, and roll around until you put the fire out. Rolling around will smother the fire quickly. Cover your face with your hands as you're rolling to protect yourself., If you can't escape your home and are waiting for help, don't panic. You may not be able to get out, but you can still take some measures to ward off the smoke and stay safe. Close your door and cover all vents and cracks around it with cloth or tape to keep the smoke out for as long as you can. Whatever you do, don't panic. You can always reclaim some measure of control, even if you feel trapped., If you are trapped in your second story room in the event of a fire, do what you can to get yourself to an area where people will be able to hear you or see you. You can take a sheet or something else - white preferably - and hang it out the window to signify that you need help when the first responders get there. Be sure to close the window -- leaving it open draws the fire towards the fresh oxygen. Put something down to prevent the smoke from coming underneath the door, such as a towel or anything that you can find.

, If you have a two-story house, you should have an escape ladder that you can throw out in case a fire or other problem happens. If you really must get out of the window, look for a ledge and if there is a ledge, you can get yourself out onto the ledge facing the building. Always face the building structure when exiting a window on an upper floor. From a second story, if you have to hang, you might get closer to the ground and you could potentially let go and fall to safety.


The truth of the matter is that you are probably a lot safer staying put and trying to compartmentalize by closing doors between you and the fire, prevent the smoke from coming into the room, and putting something over your nose and mouth to filter the air and hoping for the best.

Do a head count.,
Call your local emergency services number.,
Do an injury assessment.,
Get away from the structure.",How to Keep Safe During a House Fire2," If anybody is missing, only re-enter the building if it is safe to do so. Tell the first responders immediately on their arrival if you are afraid somebody is missing. Likewise, if everybody is accounted for, let the fire responders know so that they're not sending people in endangering their lives looking for others.

, Call 911 in North America, 000 in Australia, 111 in New Zealand and 999 in the UK or 112 from your mobile (this number has priority on the mobile phone network in the UK as too many 999 calls are made unintentionally) 112 is the emergency number in all of Europe and will be directed to the local emergency number by the network if necessary. Use your cellphone or call from a neighbor's house.

, After making the call and the resources are coming, it is time to check yourself and family members to make sure that there are no injuries. If there are, do what you can to address that and when the fire department arrives, you can ask for directions and help.

, Keep a safe distance between you and the fire. Take the necessary measures after the house fire to be safe.

Form and practice your family's escape plan.,
Make sure your home is prepared.,
Practice safe behaviors.",How to Keep Safe During a House Fire3," The best way to prevent house fires is for your family to have a plan of escape in the event of a fire. You should form your plan and practice it at least twice a year to get comfortable with the routine and to ensure that you'll be clear-headed enough to carry out your plan if the time ever comes. Here are some things to keep in mind as you do this:


Plan to find two ways to escape from each room. You should always look for a second way out in case the first way is blocked. For example, if a door is blocked, you should find a way out through a window or a different door.
Practice escaping by crawling, being in the dark, and having your eyes closed.

, To make sure that your home is prepared for a house fire, check that your smoke detectors are functioning and always have fresh batteries, and make sure that your windows can be easily opened and that their screens can be quickly removed. If you have windows with security bars, they must have quick release devices to allow them to be opened right away. Everyone in your family should know how to open and close these windows. If your home is prepared for a house fire, you'll greatly improve your chances of staying safe during one.Buy collapsible ladders that are made by a nationally recognized laboratory (such as the Underwriters Laboratory, UL), in case you'll need them to get down from the roof.

, To prevent your house from catching fire in the first place, there are some safety precautions that you should take:Teach your children that fire is a tool, not a toy.
Always be in the kitchen when you're cooking something. Don't leave cooking food unattended.
Do not smoke in the house. Make sure you put out your cigarettes completely.
Dispose of any electronics with frayed wires, which could lead to a fire.
Avoid lighting candles unless they're directly in your light of vision. Do not leave a lighted candle in a room where no one is.
always check that you have turned the gas off before leaving the kitchen.
try to use gun or lighter instead of matchsticks.

Get the starting value.,
Get the final value.,
Calculate the growth rate over one year.",How to Calculate an Annual Percentage Growth Rate1," To calculate the growth rate, you're going to need the starting value. The starting value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the beginning of the year.

For example, if a village started the year with a population of 125, then the starting value is 125.
;
, To calculate the growth, you'll not only need the starting value, you'll also need the final value. That value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the end of the year.

For example, if a village ended the year with a population of 275, then the final value is 275.


, The growth is calculated with the following formula: Growth Percentage Over One Year = FinalValue−StartValueStartValue∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {FinalValue-StartValue}{StartValue}}*100}Example Problem. A village grows from 150 people at the start of the year to 275 people at the end of the year. Calculate its growth percentage this year as follows:

Growth Percentage =275−150150∗100{\displaystyle ={\frac {275-150}{150}}*100}


=125150∗100{\displaystyle ={\frac {125}{150}}*100}

Determine the number of years.,
Calculate the annual growth rate.",How to Calculate an Annual Percentage Growth Rate2," To calculate the growth rate, you're going to need the starting value. The starting value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the beginning of the period.

For example, if the revenue of a company is $10,000 at the beginning of the period, then the starting value is 10,000.


, To calculate the annual growth, you'll not only need the starting value, you'll also need the final value. That value is the population, revenue, or whatever metric you're considering at the end of the period.

For example, if the revenue of a company is $65,000 at the period, then the final value is 65,000.


, Since you're measuring the growth rate for a series of years, you'll need to know the number of years during the period.

For example, if you want to measure the annual revenue growth of a company between 2011 and 2015, then the number of years is 2015 - 2011 or 4.


, The formula for calculating the annual growth rate is Growth Percentage Over One Year =((fs)1y−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(({\frac {f}{s}})^{\frac {1}{y}}-1)*100} where f is the final value, s is the starting value, and y is the number of years.Example Problem: A company earned $10,000 in 2011. That same company earned $65,000 four years later in 2015. What's the annual growth rate? 

Enter the values above into the growth rate formula to find the answer:

Annual Growth Rate =((6500010000)14−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(({\frac {65000}{10000}})^{\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100}


=(6.514−1)∗100{\displaystyle =(6.5^{\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100}

≈ (1.5967−1)∗100{\displaystyle (1.5967-1)*100}

= 59.67% annual growth


Note — raising a value a to the 1b{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{b}}} exponent is equivalent to taking the bth root of a. You will likely need a calculator with an ""nx{\displaystyle n{\sqrt {x}}}"" button, or a good online calculator.

Use holiday decorations that have been approved for safety by national laboratories.,
Inspect the physical condition of all electrical decorations before use.,
Refrain from plugging multiple electrical decorations into one specific outlet.,
Replace bulbs in light strings with those of the same wattage, when applicable.,
Turn off or unplug all electrical decorations when leaving the house or going to sleep.",How to Prevent an Electrical Fire During the Holidays1," Decoration packaging will contain seals or labels that indicate the product is safe to use in your home. Using decorations that lack a safety approval may be hazardous, and can trigger an electrical fire.;
, Electrical decorations should not display any loose or frayed wires, loose or cracked bulbs, or any other physical faults. If these features are present, avoid using the decorations to prevent an electrical fire.

, Some outlets cannot support multiple connections, and may become overloaded and trigger an electrical fire as a result.


Plug your decorations into multiple outlets, and read the instructions included with your decorations to determine the safest method for use.

, If you replace a bulb with a higher wattage than is required, you can potentially cause the entire string of lights to overheat and start a fire.

, Leaving your decorations unsupervised means that nobody is around to notice any fire that might start. Lights and other electrical components become overheated due to being left on for an extended period of time.

"

Only use lights and electrical decorations that are approved for outdoor use.,
Use a ladder made from wood, fiberglass, or plastic instead of metal.,
Keep all extension cords and strings of lights suspended up and away from standing water and snow.,
Place decorations away from major power lines and high-voltage areas.",How to Prevent an Electrical Fire During the Holidays2," Outdoor lights and decorations are often manufactured to withstand rain, snow, and other harsh elements. Using decorations that are approved for indoor-use only may trigger an electrical fire when coming into contact with certain elements.


Thoroughly read and inspect all decoration packaging to verify that the decorations are safe to use outdoors.

, Using a ladder made from materials other than metal will reduce your risk of becoming shocked, or starting an electrical fire.

, If extension cords and wiring come into contact with standing water, they can trigger an electrical fire or cause electrocution.

, This can prevent electrocution and an electrical fire from starting in the event you accidentally come into contact with a high-voltage power line.

Get support behind you.",How to Calculate a Prepayment Penalty," If you want to calculate a prepayment penalty, the first step is to understand what kind of penalty applies to your loan and if it is automatically an obligation under the terms of the loan. Take your mortgage agreement or other loan document and read over it to see about whether a prepayment penalty applies. Prepayment penalties come in several forms, including:


A percentage of outstanding principal.
A percentage of interest paid within a certain time period.
An interest point differential, between your interest rate and current market rates, multiplied by outstanding principal.;
, The outstanding principal on your loan is the amount that you still owe the lender. Over time, borrowers pay down their loan principal (unless they are currently in a period of deferment). You will need to know how much you still owe to figure out the penalty for paying it off early.


This amount should be on your most recent bill or on your original amortization schedule.The outstanding principal is the amount you currently owe on the loan or house. For example, if you paid a down payment of $40,000 on a $200,000 home and have since paid an additional $10,000 towards the principal in monthly payments, your outstanding principal would be $150,000 ($200,000-$40,000-$10,000).

, Assuming that you have a fixed interest rate on your loan, the annual interest rate is a key part of figuring out your prepayment penalty. If you have an adjustable rate, you may need help to calculate your prepayment penalty from your lender.This information is available in your loan contract.

, Many lenders charge a prepayment fee based on a percentage of interest paid within a certain time period, perhaps six months. For example, a common penalty is 80 percent of six months' interest. The interest refers specifically to the interest-only portion of the mortgage payment (the of your monthly payment used to pay interest rather than the principal).


For a mortgage with $150,000 remaining and a 5 percent interest rate, start by finding the interest-only payments in six months. First, divide the annual interest rate in half to get 2.5 percent. Then, multiply this value by the outstanding balance to get interest paid in six months. This would be $150,000*0.025, or $3,750.
Then, multiply this result by 80 percent to find the prepayment penalty. This would be 0.8*$3,750, or $3,000., Some prepayment penalties are based on remaining principal multiplied by a percentage. For example, a lender may charge anywhere between 1 and 4 percent of the remaining loan balance. This number may decrease during the life of the loan or remain constant.


Your lender may use a calculation to determine your penalty, rather than simply using a stated penalty. If your lender uses what's called an interest rate differential to derive your prepayment penalty, you will need to find the difference in interest rates by subtracting the interest rate you are currently paying from the current interest rate for a similar loan.
For example, if you have a 7 percent loan, but current prices for the same loan are 4 percent, the interest rate differential, and thus the prepayment fee, would be 3 percent (7 percent - 4 percent) of the outstanding principal.
In either case, find the penalty by simply multiplying the remaining principal by the stated percentage. So, for a loan with $150,000 remaining and a 3 percent penalty, the penalty would be $150,000*0.03, or $4,500., Prepayment allows a borrower to both repay their loan faster and save money on interest. This is because paying off a loan faster gives interest less time to accrue on the principal. The higher your interest rate and remaining principal, the more you stand to benefit from prepayment.


For example, a $150,000 remaining balance on a mortgage loan with a 5 percent interest rate would take almost 20 years to pay off with a monthly payment of $1,000. The borrower would also pay about $86,000 in interest alone during this period.
However, if the borrower paid just $200 more per month, they would shorten their repayment by 5 years and pay only about $62,000 in interest.
For a more extreme example, if the borrower doubled their monthly payment, they would repay the loan in 7.6 years and only pay about $30,000 in interest.Partial prepayments are usually allowed under loan contracts. These can be up to 20 percent of the balance per year and do not require the penalty to be paid., Figure out how much more you are able to pay on your mortgage each month and then calculate your interest savings using an online prepayment calculator. These calculators can be found by searching for ""loan prepayment calculator"" on a search engine. Your interest savings will be the difference between your current interest paid estimation for the life of your loan and the interest paid estimate for your new monthly payment amount. Compare this figure to your calculated prepayment penalty.


If the prepayment penalty is lower than your interest savings, taking the prepayment penalty is a good idea.
For example, using the previous example, your interest savings by paying $200 more per month would be $86,000-$62,000, or $24,000. If your prepayment penalty is less than this (odds are it will be), you should take the prepayment penalty and pay off your loan early.

, Refinancing can also incur a prepayment penalty. However, refinancing to a significantly lower rate might make the paying the prepayment penalty worth it. This is especially true if you are refinancing to a traditional 15 or 30 year loan.


Taking a prepayment penalty may be your best option for refinancing out of an expensive balloon loan (a loan with a large lump sum payment at the end)., Some loan contracts stipulate that the amount of the loan penalty decreases over the life of the loan. For example, your loan might charge a 3 percent penalty if you pay off your loan within five years, but the fee might drop to 1 percent after that time. If this is the case, consider waiting until the drop in the prepayment penalty if you are close enough to it., For mortgage loans, there are two major types of prepayment penalties that charge the penalty under different circumstances. A ""hard"" prepayment penalty charges a penalty if the borrower refinances or sells their house. A ""soft"" penalty, on the other hand, only charges the penalty if the borrower refinances. In other words, a soft penalty gives the borrower the chance to get out of the loan by selling, whereas a hard one does not. Look over your loan terms to find out which type you have., Start by calling into your lender and getting your loan office on the phone. You may have to speak to their manager if the individual loan officer can't do anything for you. Just ask whoever can help you what they can do to lower or eliminate your prepayment penalty. It's very unlikely that they will waive the fee, but perhaps they can lower it early. For example, if you are close to a scheduled reduction in prepayment fee from 4 percent to 2 percent (say, at two years into your loan's life), you can argue for an immediate drop to the 2 percent rate.This is useful if you need to refinance or sell the house immediately.

, Make sure that you ask the person you talk to on the phone to send any negotiated changes to you in writing. While on the phone, write down the names and positions of every person you talk to. In addition, write down any terms you talk about and the date of the call. Having this in writing can help to prove your case later if the bank claims they don't know about the rate change., Odds are, getting the lender to reduce or waive the prepayment fee will be difficult. However, if you and a group of borrowers in a similar situation believe that the original loan terms were unfair, you may be able to act as a group and get the loans rewritten. This may require the assistance of a local community group or organization."

Check out your local fire department’s website.,
Read books on fire safety with your family.",How to Conduct a Home Fire Drill," Discuss various ways you can evacuate your home safely and promptly in the event of a fire. Get everyone involved, including any children in your home.;
, Go through your entire house with your family and look for means of quick escape. If possible, plan on at least two escape routes for each room., Be sure there are no obstructions by these exits that could slow down your evacuation. If you have security bars on your windows, make sure they have emergency release mechanisms., Make sure that all exits are clearly marked, including doors and windows. Use different colors to indicate the routes out on each floor, and go over the map with your family periodically and before fire drills so that no one forgets exactly where to head in the event of a fire emergency.


If you have kids, ask them to help you draw up the escape plan. This is a fun way to get kids involved in fire safety planning. You can download a kid-friendly escape plan grid from this page of the National Fire Protection Association website: http://www.nfpa.org/escapeplan.
Write your local fire department’s emergency phone number on the plan.

, You will need supplies to use for your drill, and in a real house fire. These items include everything from fire extinguishers to escape ladders, as well as working smoke detectors. If you have them, test them out before the drill to guarantee that they are functioning properly, and make sure everyone knows how to use and care for them properly. To be fire safe, your home should have:


A smoke alarm on every level, and preferably one inside and outside each sleeping area. Smoke alarms should be tested once a month, and their batteries should be changed at least once a year.At least one all-purpose fire extinguisher. However, although fire extinguishers are important for fire safety, your fire drill plan should focus on escape rather than trying to extinguish the fire.Escape ladders, particularly for homes with two or more floors., If anyone is not awakened by the smoke alarms, assign someone in the household to wake that person during a drill or in the event of an actual fire.


If anyone in your house is hearing impaired, you can ask your local fire department about non-auditory alarms (for example, alarms that vibrate or flash a bright light)., Demonstrate how to configure the equipment and show the family how to use it. For safety reasons, do this from a first-floor window or balcony. Children should always practice using fire-escape ladders with adult supervision. When you're done, store the ladder beside the window for quick access in the event of a fire., Use this place to meet up during drills and in the event of a real fire. Make sure the location is far enough from your home to avoid being harmed by the fire, but still close by.A spot across the street or a neighbor's lawn are good ideas. Pick a specific landmark, like a lamp post or a mailbox.
Mark the location you select on your escape plan.

, In the event of a real fire, you can use it to contact emergency services after you have moved to a safe location. Encourage everyone in the family to memorize local emergency phone numbers.

, Very young children, elderly people, and people with limited mobility may need help getting out of the home during a drill or a real fire. Assign a member of the family to assist anyone who needs help.

, Regular practice will help your family feel prepared and calm in the event of a real fire emergency.

, The point of a drill is to practice exactly what you would do during a real fire. Try to simulate all of the safety and escape techniques you discussed when you created your fire plan.


Blow a whistle or set off your smoke alarms, and help your family out quickly and calmly.
Practice rolling out of bed and staying low to the floor to avoid inhaling “smoke.”
Close doors behind you to prevent the spread of smoke and fire.

, To make the drill experience more realistic and test your family’s preparedness, run the drill at night, or at some time when your family is present at home but unsuspecting.


If you have small children, allow them to practice the drill a few times before surprising them with a nighttime drill. You can also warn them before they go to bed that there will be a drill during the night. Part of the purpose of the drill is to help everyone remain calm in the event of a real fire emergency, so it is important that the drills are not frightening for young children., Regular fire drills provide an opportunity to try out all of the possible escape plans you and your family have developed together.


Try different escape routes (for example, via the escape ladder, through a window, or through a door).
Practice a scenario where no safe escape routes are available. Move to a room where your hypothetical fire has not spread and close all the doors. Put towels under the doors, and seal any cracks around the doors and vents in the room with duct tape. If there are windows in the room, open them slightly to provide ventilation., In a real fire, it is crucial to stay outside until the fire has been put out. Instruct your family to remain at the designated meeting place until the drill has finished.

, That way, everyone will know how to find the things they need in case of a real fire emergency. Congratulate your family on a job well done!

, The workers and firefighters can offer additional tips, recommendations for equipment, and smoke alarm inspections.

, Many fire department websites feature home safety tips, information about local emergency services, and links to other useful resources.

, Children’s books on fire safety are a fun way to get your kids involved and thinking about what to do in a fire emergency.


To get kids thinking about what to do in case of a fire, try a book like No Dragons for Tea: Fire Safety for Kids by Jean Pendziwol and Martine Gourbault.

Miss Mingo and the Fire Drill, by Jamie Harper, can help introduce kids to the concept of a fire drill.

Find companies that offer DRIPs.,
Select the stock or stocks you want to buy.,
Ensure you have a balanced portfolio.,
Purchase company stock.,
Invest in DRIPs through your online brokerage account.,
Enroll in a DRIP program through a transfer agent.,
Pay attention to fees.,
Set up an automatic investment schedule.,
Prepare for taxes.",How to Buy a DRIP Stock," Before you can decide on which companies you want to invest in, you'll first have to locate companies that offer DRIPs. You can do that with a simple Google search or checking out sites that are known to maintain a list of companies that allow shareholders to enter a DRIP program., Remember, you're investing in a company. Be sure to pick a great company that has a proven track record of performance over the years and has the potential for continued growth.


Look at the chart of the company's stock price. It should show a distinct, upward trend over the long-term. Remember that DRIPS are long-term investments even more so than standard stocks. That's because you can buy stocks at the price you want when you want. However, you buy DRIPs based on a schedule. You could get unlucky enough that your DRIP shares are frequently purchased when the stock price is near a high. That's why you should approach DRIP investing with the a time frame of building wealth over years or, better yet, decades.
Look for a company that has a history of increasing its dividends. Remember, you're going to be buying new shares of stock with the dividends. Wouldn't it be great if those dividends increase over time so that you can buy even more shares?
Look for a company that has a history of revenue growth over the years. Although not every single year is expected to be better than the previous one, the general trend should show that the company's revenue grows over time.
Look for a company that's in a business you understand. If you're in pharmaceuticals, pick a pharmaceutical company. If you're in manufacturing, pick a manufacturing company. The advice of the great investor Peter Lynch still stands: buy what you know., You don't want all your eggs in one basket. If all of your DRIP stocks are from the same industry, and that industry experiences a recession, then your portfolio value could plummet. Be sure that you're properly diversified with stocks from different sectors.

, Before you can even enroll in the DRIP program for a company, you must already be a shareholder. In most cases, you only need to own one share of stock. You can buy that share of stock with your favorite online brokerage.


Be sure that you purchase the share of stock in your own name, or the name you plan on using to enroll in the DRIP program.
You might also be able to purchase shares of stock directly from the company with no commission. Contact the company's investor relations department for more information on that.
You can also use the ""buddy system"" to get your first share of stock. For example, if you know somebody who owns stock in Walgreen's, you can use the company's transfer agent to transfer one of his or shares into your own name.

, Many of the major online brokerages allow you to do almost any type of investing, including DRIP investing. Just login to your brokerage account and use the search bar to search for ""DRIPs"". The search results should give you some articles and tutorials about how to enroll in DRIPs online.

, All of the companies that offer DRIPs use a transfer agent to administer the program. You'll need to get in touch with the transfer agent that handles DRIPs for the stock you want to purchase.


An easy way to find the the transfer agent is to go to the ""Investor Relations"" or ""Investors"" section of the company website. For example, the ""Investors"" page of Abbott Laboratories has a ""Dividend Reinvestment"" link.. If you click that link, you'll be taken to a page that gives you information about the company's DRIP program.. You'll also see a link to computershare, the transfer agent responsible for administering the DRIP for Abbott Laboratories.Contact computerShare for more information about enrolling in that DRIP.
You can alternatively just Google the company name plus the word ""DRIP"" to find the transfer agent. If you Google ""Abbott Laboratories DRIP"", you'll find the Computershare link right at the top., There are some fees associated with DRIP programs. You don't want excessive fees taking a bite out of your return on investment. You'll find that most of the fees are minimal, but check them out before you enroll just to be safe.


The fees should be listed on the transfer agent's website. If not, give them a call and ask about the fee structure.

, Once you've purchased the initial shares, plan to invest a little each month through an automatic withdrawal from your savings or checking account. That's how you'll maximize the growth of your account.


Keep in mind that the automatic reinvestment schedule varies from company to company. Some companies will reinvest dividends every week. Others pay dividends twice a month. Still others pay quarterly. Contact the company so that you know when the dividends will be reinvested.

, Even though your dividend income is reinvested, it's still considered income for tax purposes. Be ready to pay taxes on what you've earned.


At the beginning of the calendar year, you'll receive a 1099 form from each company that you're investing in. That form will provide you with the amount of income that you need to report.

Face up to those difficult decisions!,
Know when something isn’t quite right.,
Make a decision to stop.,
Learn how to cut your losses.,
Study the opportunity cost and the law of comparative advantage.,
Sum up your understanding and start over.",How to Use ‘Zero Based Thinking’ When Making Hard Decisions," Zero-Based Thinking puts previous decisions you made on trial. It requires you to examine all your current activities––business, career, relationships etc., and ask yourself the question: “Knowing What I Know Now (KWIKN), would I still make the same decision? Would you get into that relationship, start the same business; make that investment etc., again”? If the answer to this question is “No!”, then the very next step is to ask yourself “how do I get out of this and how fast”? In other words, revert to zero and start from scratch. This is the ultimate ‘drawing a line in the sand’ personal development exercise.


Zero-Based Thinking goes against traditional dogma of sticking with something even if it does more personal damage to you than good, which is often one of the biggest problems in personal strategic planning, namely attempting to make something work that you wouldn’t even have gotten into in the first place had you known better.;
, The best indicator of a zero-based thinking situation is stress or frustration; something keeping you up at night and continually preoccupying your mind.


Often the best solution for your biggest problem is simply to discontinue that activity altogether. Just going cold turkey on your biggest problem can be the simplest and most direct solution to that problem.

, This is like grabbing the steering wheel of your own car and wrenching it, stopping you in your tracks immediately and giving yourself the opportunity to turn around. The key idea here is no matter how long you have gone down the wrong road you can always turn back. As they say, there’s never a wrong time to do the right thing.


You will be amazed at how creative you become when you do this exercise, examining every area of your life as though you could start again. Numerous possibilities will arise, difficult situations will be confronted and solutions will emerge.

, Zero-based thinking is a great decision-making tool when it comes to money management and investments also. If you know that a particular stock purchase or property investment is simply eroding your wealth now but you’ve had difficulty facing up to this realty, don’t waste a single second more, and ask yourself the hard question: “Knowing What I Know Now... would I purchase that property/stock”. If the answer is no, it’s time to make that hard decision and cut your losses so you can invest your capital elsewhere to get a superior return and build wealth.

, The concept of Opportunity Cost and the Law of Comparative Advantage as attributed to nineteenth century English economist David Ricardo, is often associated with macro economics and international trade. However, it can equally be applied to personal development. The chief problem with holding onto a business, relationship or “investment” that does not serve you is not just the limitations it puts on you but the real loss is the loss of opportunity elsewhere, such as business endeavors, relationships, investments you could be making elsewhere that would serve you better.


Remember, every activity/situation has an opportunity cost, the cost of not participating/contributing to another opportunity. A good question to ask yourself to assess potential opportunity costs is, ""What other opportunities am I missing out on that would serve me better than my current activities do”.
Each day we are faced with opportunity cost decisions in our business and personal lives. Another lens through which we could view the law of comparative advantage is the 80/20 rule (sometimes referred to as the Pareto Principle, named after Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist). Applying the 80/20 rule here might also lead you to ask yourself “What are the highest value (20%) activities I should be undertaking” and then delegate or eliminate the other low-value (80%) activities.

, If a certain decision you made is now holding you back in life, just be ruthless, use the Knowing What I Know Now Q&A technique to give yourself the chance to start over. There is no honor, no dignity and no purpose in pursuing something that no longer inspires you or serves you. From a wealth creation perspective, Zero-Based Thinking is an excellent way of doing a quick back-of-an-envelope analysis on whether an “investment” you made is still worth keeping or not.


All your problems started out as opportunities or good ideas at one stage but that could have been a long time ago. It’s very possible that your life, your needs and your knowledge has evolved and what was once a good idea, opportunity or investment may not be so now. Remember, it’s never too late to do the right thing. No matter how long you have been going down the wrong road, you can always stop and turn back.

Understand the relationship between the spot value and the forward value.",How to Account for Forward Contracts," This is a contract between a seller and a buyer. The seller agrees to sell a commodity in the future at a price upon which they agree today. The seller agrees to deliver this asset in the future, and the buyer agrees to purchase the asset in the future. No physical exchange takes place until the specified future date. This contract must be accounted for now, when it is signed, and again on the date when the physical exchange takes place.For example, suppose a seller agrees to sell grain to a buyer in 3 months for $12,000, but the current value of the grain is only $10,000. In one year, when the exchange takes place, the market value of the grain is $11,000, so in the end, the seller makes a profit of $1,000 on the sale.
The spot rate, or current value, of the grain is $10,000.
The forward rate, or future value, of the grain is $12,000.;
, On the liability side of the equation, you would credit the Asset Obligation for the spot rate. Then, on the asset side of the equation, you would debit the Asset Receivable for the forward rate. Finally, debit or credit the Contra-Asset Account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. You would debit, or decrease the Contra- Asset Account for a discount and credit, or increase it for a premium.Using the example above, the seller would credit the Asset Obligation account for $10,000. He has made a commitment to sell his grain today, and today it is worth $10,000.
But, he is going to receive $12,000 for the grain. So he debits Assets Receivable for $12,000. This is what he’s going to be paid.
To account for the $2,000 premium, he credits the Contra-Asset Account for $2,000.

, On the liability side of the equation, you would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of the forward rate. Then you would record the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate as a debit or credit to the Contra-Assets Account. On the asset side of the equation, you would debit Assets Receivable for the spot rate.Using the example above, the buyer would credit Contracts Payable in the amount of $12,000. Then he would debit the Contra-Assets Account for $2,000 to account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.
Then he would debit Assets Receivable for $10,000.

, First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Asset Obligations by the spot value on the contract date. On the asset side, credit Contracts Receivable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.Using the above example, on the liability side you would debit Asset Obligations by $10,000.
On the asset side, you would credit Contracts Receivable by $12,000/
Then you would debit the Contra-Asset account by $2,000, the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate.

, Determine the current market value of the commodity. This is its value on the date of the physical exchange between the buyer and seller. Next, debit, or increase, your cash account by the forward rate. Then credit, or decrease, your Asset account by the current market value of the commodity. Finally, recognize the gain or loss, which is the difference between the forward rate and the current market value, with a debit or credit on the Asset Account.In the example above the current market value of the grain on the date of the physical exchange is $11,000.
First, the seller must increase cash based on the contracted amount, so he would debit cash by $12,000.
Next he must reduce the Asset account by the current market value by recording a credit of $11,000.
Then, to recognize the gain of $1,000 (which is the current value, $11,000, less the spot rate, $10,000), he would record a credit on the Asset Account of $1,000.

, First, you close out your asset and liability accounts. On the liability side, debit Contracts Payable by the forward rate, and debit or credit the Contra-Assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. On the asset side, credit Assets Receivable by the spot rate on the date of the contract.Using the example above, on the liability side, the buyer would debit Contracts Payable by $12,000 and credit the Contra-Asset Account by $2,000.
On the asset side, he would credit Assets Receivable by $10,000.

, Decrease, or credit the Cash account by the amount of the forward rate. Then, record the difference between the forward rate and the current market value as an additional credit or debit to the Cash account. Finally, increase, or debit, the Asset account by the current market value of the commodity.In the above example, the buyer would debit Cash by $12,000.
The difference between the market value, $11,000, and the forward rate $12,000, is $1,000. They buyer lost $1,000, so he would record a debit to Cash of $1,000.
Next, he would debit the Asset account by $11,000.

, A forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to deliver a commodity on a future date for a specified price. The value of the commodity on that future date is calculated using rational assumptions about rates of exchange. Farmers use forward contracts to eliminate risk for falling grain prices.Forward contracts are also used in transactions using foreign exchange in an effort to reduce the risk of losses due to changes in the exchange rates., A derivative is a security with a price that is based upon, or derived, from something else. Forward contracts are considered derivative financial instruments because the future value of the commodity is derived from other information about the commodity.The future value of the commodity for the forward contract is derived from the current market value, or spot price, and the risk-free rate of return.

, In investing, hedging means minimizing risk. In forward contracts, buyers and sellers attempt to minimize risk of losses by locking in prices for commodities in advance. Buyers lock in a price in hopes that they will end up paying less than the current market value of a commodity. Sellers hedge their risks with forward contracts in an attempt to protect themselves from falling prices., The party agreeing to purchase the commodity assumes the long position. The party agreeing to sell the commodity is assuming the short position.The buyer, who is in the long position, is the person who stands to benefit if the price of the commodity rises higher than expected.
The seller, who is in the short position, stands to lose if the price of the commodity rises.

, The spot value and the forward value are both quotes for the rate at which the commodity will be bought or sold. The difference between the two has to do with the timing of the settlement and delivery of the commodity. Both parties in a forward contract need to know both values in order to accurately account for the forward contract.]


The spot rate is the current market value for the asset in question. It is the value of the commodity if it were sold today. For example, a farmer selling grain for the spot value agrees to sell it immediately for the current price.The forward rate is the agreed-upon future price in the contract. For example, suppose the farmer in the above example wants to enter into a forward contract in an effort to hedge against falling grain prices. He can agree to sell his grain to another party in six months at agreed-upon forward rate. When the time comes to sell, the grain will be sold for the agreed-upon forward rate, despite fluctuations that occur in the spot rate during the intervening six months., The spot rate can be used to determine the forward rate. This is because a commodity’s future value is based in part on its current value. The other factor that is used to determine the forward value is the risk-free rate.The risk-free rate is the rate at which the commodity is expected to change in value with zero risk. It is usually based on the current interest rate of a three-month U.S. Treasury bill, which is considered the safest investment you can make."

Let R x T = 72, where R = the rate of growth (for example, the interest rate), T = doubling time (in years) (for example, the time it takes to double an amount of money).,
Insert a value for R. For example, how long does it take to turn $100 into $200 at a yearly interest rate of 5%?,
Solve for the unknown variable.,
Study these additional examples:


How long does it take to double an amount of money at a rate of 10% per annum?,
Let R x T = 72, where R is the rate of growth (in these examples it's the interest rate), and T is the time it takes to double any amount of money.

,
Enter the value of T. For example, let's say you want to double your money in ten years.,
Solve for R. Divide both sides by 10 to get R = 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2.",How to Use the Rule of 721,";
, Letting R = 5, we get 5 x T = 72.

, In this example, divide both sides of the above equation by R (that is, 5) to get T = 72 ÷ 5 = 14.4. So it takes 14.4 years to double $100 to $200 at an interest rate of 5% per annum. (The initial amount of money doesn't matter. It will take the same amount of time to double no matter what the beginning amount is.)

, Let 10 x T = 72, so that T = 7.2 years.
How long does it take to turn $100 into $1600 at a rate of 7.2% per annum? Recognize that 100 must double four times to reach 1600 ($100 → $200, $200 → $400, $400 → $800, $800 → $1600). For each doubling, 7.2 x T = 72, so T = 10. So as each doubling takes ten years, the total time required (to multiply $100 by 16) is 40 years.

,, What interest rate would you need in order to do that? Enter 10 for T in the equation. R x 10 = 72.

, So you will need an annual interest rate of 7.2% in order to double your money in ten years.

"
"
Estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money (or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation).,
Estimate the rate of decay (R) over a given time span: R = 72 ÷ T. Enter a value for T, and solve for R. For example:


If the buying power of $100 becomes worth only $50 in ten years, what is the inflation rate during that time?,
Ignore any unusual data.",How to Use the Rule of 722," Solve T = 72 ÷ R. This is the same equation as above, just slightly rearranged. You simply enter a value for R. For example:


How long will it take for $100 to assume the purchasing power of $50, given an inflation rate of 5% per year?

Let 5 x T = 72, so that T = 72 ÷ 5, meaning T = 14.4. That's how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5% inflation.



,

R x 10 = 72, where T = 10. Then R = 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2%.

Complete the transaction.",How to Get Immediate Cash for Your Annuity1," Investments work best when they are allowed to grow over the long term. Withdrawing cash early from an annuity brings with it a risk of fees and will significantly harm the long-term potential of your investment. Consider very carefully whether you are in a true financial emergency before taking steps to sell an annuity, and be sure to use early withdrawal options only as a last resort.;
, Because of the potential penalties of getting cash from an annuity, consider other options for getting cash during a financial emergency.Many of these options come with lower risks and few to no financial penalties. These include:



Take out a short-term, unsecured loan (a loan without collateral) from your bank or a local credit union.

Renting out a room via AirBNB or another website.

Sell unwanted items online.
Take on an additional part-time job or side gig, such as babysitting, dogsitting, or working retail.

Get a Home Equity Loan. These loans will require interest payments, but they might be lower than the penalties you would pay for cashing in an annuity.

, In some cases, you might be able to receive small, immediate cash payouts from your annuity without too many penalties and fees. However, if you need to cash in your entire annuity, you will likely pay some hefty fines. Therefore, it is important that you know exactly how much cash you need to get through your financial emergency. By only taking out the money you absolutely need, you might be able to be more financially stable in the long run.

, An immediate annuity will provide monthly, quarterly, or annual cash payments to the investor immediately after the investment is purchased. A deferred annuity, however, allows the investment to grow for a period of some years before the payouts begin.If you have an immediate annuity already, you can simply collect your cash installments at the appropriate intervals. Depending on how much cash you require, these installments might be sufficient for your needs.
When payments are made, annuities are taxed on the earning portion of the asset, not a return of principal.
Additionally, an immediate annuity within a retirement account, like a Roth IRA, can provide penalty-free payments to persons under 59.5 years of age., This option is one that many investors consider as they transition into retirement. They use the deferred annuity to grow their money over the long-term and then convert into an immediate annuity to guarantee an income stream during their retirement.If you convert your deferred annuity to an immediate annuity, you might have the best of both worlds: immediate access to some cash while still allowing your investment portfolio to grow.Depending on when you purchased your deferred annuity, however, it might be costly for you to pursue the conversion option. Make sure you discuss fees and penalties carefully with your insurance company and your financial advisor before undertaking a conversion., If you have an immediate annuity, you will receive several small payments each year. This option is a good one for those who are in immediate need of cash (such as those who are on a fixed income). And as long as you only collect the amount specified in your contract, you can do so without paying extra fees.


You will still likely have to pay income tax on a portion or all of the amount you collect.While immediate annuities provide an immediate cash flow, they generally pay out less total money than deferred annuities, which have more of an opportunity to grow., A surrender period is the period of time after the initial purchase of the annuity where you will be charged hefty fees for cashing out your plan. A surrender period can be anywhere from 5-10 years after purchase, depending on your contract, though it is usually between 6-8 years.If your surrender period has passed, you might be able to cash out your annuity without paying too many fees.
If your surrender period has not yet passed, you might want to consider the expenses involved before continuing the early withdrawal process.

, Unlike deferred annuities, most immediate annuities do not provide an option for small-sum early withdrawals or partial sales. You will likely have the opportunity, however, to sell the entire immediate annuity for a lump-sum.Again, reserve this option as a last resort given the hassle and fees involved in cashing out your immediate annuity early.

, Withdrawing cash from your annuity early can lead to hefty penalties, taxes, and fines. Be sure that you take these penalties into account before making your decision to withdraw your cash.If your annuity is part of a retirement account and you withdraw your money before you are 59.5 years old, you will have to pay a 10% early withdrawal fee to the federal government.If you withdraw your money within the first 5-8 years of purchase, you will likely have to pay a ""surrender fee"" to your insurance company. The exact fee amount depends on your contract. Many surrender fees begin at about a 7% penalty for the first year after purchase and decrease over time from there. However, some companies might charge a fee as high as 20%.Cash you receive from annuities counts as income. You will likely have to pay income taxes in addition to the early withdrawal fees and surrender fees. The one exception is that payments from an annuity as part of a Roth IRA are not taxable.

, None will give you the full value of your future payments. They might offer anywhere from 60% to 85% of the value of your annuity. Getting 85% of your annuity’s value would be considered a fairly good offer. Since you are legally transferring your rights, you want a company that follows standard procedures and will prepare you for any required court proceedings.


Understand that you are not getting a good deal here because the company you are selling to has to make a profit. Annuity sale prices are reached by discounting a series of future cash flows by some interest rate. Typically, a buyer will use a lower rate than is earned in the annuity to make a profit themselves. This results in a lower sale price for you.

, Before agreeing to sell your annuity to a third party, consult a trusted legal or financial expert. They will help you determine your financial liability and help you navigate through the complicated contracts you might have to sign. This will help to ensure that you understand what is happening and that it is done correctly. They might also be able to help guide you to the most reputable companies that purchase annuities.

, Documents required for the sale of an annuity include two forms of identification, your initial annuity policy, and an application to sell your annuity to a third party. You might have to contact your insurance company in order to receive correct, up-to-date copies of your paperwork., Upon submitting your paperwork and paying your fees and penalties, you will be able to receive your cash payout. Make sure that you report this income correctly during tax time and that you pay all the extra taxes on this money to avoid future penalties.


You might want to consider discussing your finances with a financial advisor to ensure that you will use and invest the cash payout properly.

Complete the transaction.",How to Get Immediate Cash for Your Annuity2," There are three kinds of annuity, each one of which pays out money slightly differently. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates all variable annuities and some index annuities. The SEC does not regulate fixed annuities.A fixed annuity pays out a predetermined amount at specific intervals over a period of time. This amount is usually based on a specific interest rate applied to your initial investment.An indexed annuity provides payment to the investor based on the performance of a stock market index fund (or, a fund that tracks the entire stock market performance). Most indexed annuities, however, have a set minimum for payments even if the index fund performs poorly.A variable annuity allows the investor to choose amongst various investment vehicles, usually mutual funds. Your periodic payment will depend upon the performance of these investments., In addition to the different types of annuity payments, annuities can be held in various types of accounts for certain purposes. These typically include investment and retirement accounts. Both types operate generally the same way, however, they may differ in early withdrawal and tax penalties charged. Check your investment documents or retirement plan agreement to see what type of penalties and restrictions there are on your annuity.

, Some deferred annuity policies provide an option for small cash withdrawals without extra penalties. For example, a withdrawal of 5-10% of your initial investment might be accomplished without paying a ""surrender fee"" to your insurance company. While taking an early withdrawal will diminish your investment's ability to grow, you might be able to get the cash you need without completely emptying your annuity.If your annuity is part of a retirement account and you are under 59.5 years old, you might still have to pay a 10% tax to the federal government, even if you don't have to pay a penalty to your insurance company.

, A surrender period is the period of time after the initial purchase of the annuity where you will be charged hefty fees for cashing out your plan. A surrender period can be anywhere from 5-10 years after purchase, depending on your contract, though it is usually between 6-8 years.If your surrender period has passed, you might be able to cash out your annuity without paying too many fees.
If your surrender period has not yet passed, you might want to consider the expenses involved before continuing the early withdrawal process.

, Review the details of your annuity contract. Pay attention to the full-disclosure clause of your agreement. It’s important that you understand what portion of your annuity payments you are exchanging for a lump-sum cash payment.

, If you are seeking a lump sum of cash in lieu of structured payments, you are in effect signing over to someone else all your rights to receive future annuity payments. That ""someone else"" is the entity giving you the lump-sum cash.


Be aware that in the long term your annuity is worth much more if you receive structured payments according to the original contract. Talk to your insurance agent to determine the exact worth of your annuity. You may decide to ride out your immediate cash-flow crisis instead of cashing in.

Understand Italian train tickets versus reservations.,
Research the train routes.,
Book tickets up to 90 days in advance.,
Purchase train tickets when you arrive in Italy using the automated touch-screen machines at train stations.,
Purchase train tickets from the tellers.,
Buy a Eurail Pass if you are going to be traveling through Italy by train extremely often and you are unable to make advanced reservations on the trenitalia.com website.,
Validate your train ticket when boarding a train.",How to Buy Train Tickets in Italy," The train system in Italy is different than many other countries because they separate the ticket that allows you to ride on the train itself and the ticket that allows you to sit in an assigned seat. The latter is called a ""reservation,"" and an ""R"" indicates whether it is required on a train schedule.


Italian rail passes and train tickets do not guarantee you a seat on the train. If the train seats are full, but tickets are not required, you must stand for the duration of the ride. If the trip requires you to have a reservation, you must buy both a ticket and a reservation.
Train reservations are necessary, in addition to the ticket, for trains going to other countries, trains that travel at peak times and overnight trains. They are also essential for travel around holidays. You cannot legally ride an Italian train with a reservation but without a ticket.
If you are traveling within Italy at off-peak times, check the train schedule to see if there is an ""R"" next to the train route for which you have a ticket. If there is not an ""R"" (reservation required), you will only need to purchase a ticket. Remember that the Italian trains will sell more tickets than they have seats, if there is high demand.;
, If you are traveling to Italy, it is a good idea to establish what towns you would like to visit. Learn the Italian names for cities, not just the English names.


For example, the Italian name for Florence is ""Firenze."" The Italian name for Rome is ""Roma."" Milan is ""Milano."" Venice is ""Venezia"" and Sicily is ""Sicilia."" Genoa is ""Genova"" and Turin is ""Torino."" It is a good idea to also learn the names of the major airports.

, If you plan to travel on an overnight train, long-distance trip or during peak holiday times. You can book Italian train tickets online using a credit card.


Purchase tickets online from www.trenitalia.com if you have a European credit card. This site allows you to search for travel dates and discounts.
Purchase tickets from WhyGo Italy.com if you have an American credit card. The Trenitalia site does not take American credit cards. Click on the ""Italy Train Travel"" section and purchase Italy rail passes or separate train tickets. You can also pay for reservations on this site.
It is a good idea to book the long-distance trips as close to 90-days before as possible. You can find the best discounts at this time, including ""Super-Economy"" or ""Economy"" that are under $15 for a second-class fare.

, The Trenitalia ticket machines allow credit card purchases from most international credit cards, including American cards. If you know you are going to use the train to travel from 1 place to another, it is a good idea to purchase some tickets when you arrive.

, There are often 2 windows for purchasing train tickets, 1 for same day travel and another for future travel. You can use Euros to purchase these tickets.

, It is far cheaper to book economy tickets months in advance than to book a few days ahead using a Eurail Pass and pay the surcharge.


If you already have a Eurail Pass you can book tickets in 2 ways. You can go online to www.fsitaliane.it, search for train journeys and book with the ""Global Pass"" function. You will need to pay your surcharge online. You can also use the automated touch-screen machines at train stations and pay the surcharge using a credit card.

, There are yellow machines at entrance points so that you can validate your ticket for the specific trip you are taking. You will be fined by the conductor if you fail to do this.


There are some very small train stations that do not have yellow validation machines. In this case, you may be able to give your ticket to the conductor to be punched.

Familiarize yourself with the subway map.,
Understand the acronym: DWA.,
Get to know the bus routes, too.,
Realize that emergencies can happen on public transit.,
Pay the appropriate fare.,
Consider the Blue Night network if you travel at night.,
Use bike racks if you're using your bike to travel around the city.,
Watch out for vehicles when exiting streetcars.,
Download the Transit Now app from the Toronto Transit Commission to know exactly when the next bus will arrive.",How to Use the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)," Toronto's subway system is complex and requires a sharp mind and some skill.


By observing the map above you, you'll see that there are four categories of subway lines.

The Yellow line is called the: 'Yonge-University line'.
The green line is called the: 'Bloor-Danforth' line.
The blue line is called the 'Scarborough RT' line. Keep in mind that the Scarborough line does not use subway trains but ICTS Mark I trains.
The purple line is called the 'Sheppard' line.


When you're on the platform at a subway station, know where is north, south, east and west. You can simply determine this by looking up at the large map above you. This large sign will display the station you are at in a large-easily to read font, a copy of Toronto's subway map, and whichever way the train you are waiting for. Example: Don Mills Station - (Toronto Subway Map) - Line category on top and direction of travel (ex.Westbound to Leslie).;
, 'DWA' stands for Designated Waiting Area. The DWA is the standard spot for riders to catch the next train. On the edge of the platform is a yellow line. Riders are prohibited from passing the yellow line as it is dangerous.

, Some routes within the TTC system have different variations. For example: 100 Flemingdon Park and 100A Flemingdon Park. This means that taking the 100A would take you to an unintended place as opposed to taking the 100 which supposedly would take you to the place you intended to go.

, Emergencies such as assaults, vandalism, and accidents can occur on public transit. Don't hesitate to press the alarm (there are many alarm buttons on subway trains and subway platforms). At subway stations, security guards, called Special Constables are on guard, ready to serve, protect and inform riders. Interact with Special Constables, they're very friendly and they are knowledgeable.

, The Toronto Transit Commission relies on its riders to generate its transit system. So paying the appropriate fare is the right thing to do. For a list of fares according to age, go onto http://ttc.ca. On their home page, you will find info regarding this. You also can purchase a metropass is you're a frequent user or a Student Discount Card. All that information is posted on the TTC's website. Understand that refusing to pay the appropriate fare will result in being fined by a TTC special constable and you may be subject to court.

, The Blue night network is the overnight transit service provided by the TTC. This network consist of 22 routes and two streetcar routes, distributed so that almost all of the city is within 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) of at least one route. During the Blue Night service, The route may change if the route is part of the Blue Night network. For example, the 25 Don Mills route will be changed to: '303 Don Mills' during Blue Night hours.


Also note that during the Blue Night Network, you can request the bus operator to drop you off on front of your home rather than the closest bus stop if you feel vulnerable walking alone out at night.

, The Toronto Transit Commission provides bike racks on all buses for riders who want to take public transit using their bikes. When the bus approaches and stops at the bus stop, inform the driver you want to load your bike onto the rack (if you need assistance with this, inform the driver, he'll/she'll be happy to help). Once done loading the bike onto the rack, hop onto the bus, pay the fare and wait until your stop. When you've arrived at your stop, inform the driver that you'll be unloading your bike from the rack. Unload it and carry on with your day. For a better visual, tend to this video provided by the Toronto Transit Commission at the bottom of the page.

, As some should know, there are many crazy drivers in the city of Toronto. Look both ways before exiting a streetcar. After all, streetcars don't pull up safely to the curb like buses.

, You can download this in Apple's App Store, Android's Google Play store. This app is free and works. All you need to do is enter the route you are going to board and what stop you are at ( determined by nearest intersection of the stop you're at).

Try coloring in books for adults or do some Zentangle drawing. Doodles are acceptable too.

, You could read from a book, newspaper, magazine, e-book, or other reading item. Try to avoid doing this if you get motion sickness.

, Choose something that you would enjoy and that you're not likely to get bored with quickly.

, Sit back and relax. Use the things you brought with you. Look out the window at the scenery or talk to other people.

, Just keep a calm mentality about the bus ride. This is harder than it sounds but, when mastered, it is a big help in many areas of life.

, You could enjoy the scenery or play ""I Spy"" games to take up time. Just try to think that the ride is going to end soon, and look at the beautiful scenery whizzing past.

",How to Haul a Motorcycle,"


Ramps should be rated for at least 800 pounds (364 kg). Ramps with a lesser weight rating may start to twist, bend, or fail completely with continued use.






Look in your owner's manual for the weight of your motorcycle or ask your dealer.





;
,,


Cut a piece of plywood 5-by-1 foot (1.52-by-.3 m) to place right behind the back window.






Nail 2, 2-by-4s that are 1-foot (30.5 cm) long far enough apart to accommodate your front tire, which is typically about 4 inches (10.2 cm). This will hold the tire steady and not allow it to twist from side to side.






Nail a 2-by-4 to the front of these 2 boards to act as a front tire chock and to stop the motorcycle from rolling forward.







, This will keep the motorcycle upright and protect the bed of the truck.

,,,, This can help secure the bikes when you haul motorcycles.


Attach a pair of the tie downs to the front corners of the truck, and extend them as far out as they can go.






Attach them to a structural part of the bike such as the triple tree or the front of the engine where the frame meets the crash bars, which is found on inverted fork bikes.







,


Run the straps to the back corners of the truck and secure on the tie brackets.






Find a high place on the motorcycle, such as the chassis, to attach the tie downs to and tighten.

Park the truck and motorcycle on a firm, level surface.,
Unfold the motorcycle ramp and place the rubber end on the tailgate.,
Use a ratchet tie-down to secure the ramp to the truck.,
Put the motorcycle in neutral.,
Have a friend help push the motorcycle up the ramp.",How to Transport a Motorcycle1," Never attempt to load a motorcycle into a pickup truck on uneven ground, or soft ground that may give way as you move the motorcycle. Black top or concrete are the preferred surfaces to use when loading your bike into a pickup truck.Never use pieces of wood on grass or dirt as a loading surface, as the wood may sink, break or slide.
Do not attempt to load a motorcycle into a truck on an uneven surface to prevent falling over or dropping the motorcycle itself as you load it.;
, You should always use a ramp intended for use in loading motorcycles onto trucks and trailers when doing so. Motorcycles can be extremely heavy, so the ramp must be designed to be able withstand the weight of the motorcycle. These ramps usually fold in half to easily transport them, so unfold it and place the rubber end on the tailgate of the truck. The metal end should rest flat on the ground.The rubber will protect the tailgate of the truck from being scratched as the truck’s suspension lowers under the weight of the motorcycle.
Be sure the ramp rests evenly on the ground to ensure it does not damage your motorcycle tire or cause it to move in an unpredictable way when you’re pushing it onto the ramp.

, Most ramps will have a hook intended for use in securing the ramp to the truck. Place one hook from a ratchet tie down (also known as a ratchet strap) through the hook on the ramp and secure the other end to a loop or hook in the bed of the truck. Use the ratchet to tighten the strap until the ramp is held firmly in place.Without a strap securing the ramp, it could slide backward and fall off the tailgate of the truck when you push the motorcycle onto it.
Do not use a bungee strap to secure the ramp. Bungee straps may give, allowing the ramp to fall.

, If you leave your motorcycle in gear to prevent the wheels from rolling when you aren’t riding it, you will need to take it back out of gear in order to push it. Motorcycle shift levers are located on the side of the motorcycle and are controlled by the rider’s left foot. Press down on the shift lever until the motorcycle is in first gear, the pull back up on the lever lightly to put it in neutral.Neutral in a motorcycle is found between first and second gear.
Most motorcycles have a neutral light on the gauge pod to let you know that the motorcycle is in neutral.

, Pushing your motorcycle onto the truck should be a two person job. Attempting to do so alone could result in the motorcycle falling, causing significant harm to the bike and to you. Place both of your hands on the handle bars of the motorcycle and ask your friend to push from the back. Roll it up the ramp together, but stop before the motorcycle is all the way into the truck. Use your right hand to squeeze the front brake lever on the handle bars to prevent the motorcycle from rolling backwards as your friend climbs into the bed of the truck to help pull it the rest of the way.Having your friend switch places halfway through will not be necessary if you can enlist the help of a third friend.
Make sure the brakes are holding the weight of the motorcycle from rolling backward before your friend releases it to climb into the truck.

Gather the necessary equipment.,
Place wheel chocks around the rear tire.,
Strap the handlebars to the sides of the truck or trailer.,
Run a soft loop strap through the rear of the bike.,
Tighten down all the straps.",How to Transport a Motorcycle2," In order to securely strap your motorcycle in place on a trailer or in the bed of a pickup truck, you will need three ratchet straps with at least one “soft loop” or heavy duty loop for your straps that is designed to prevent damage from rubbing on painted components of your motorcycle. You may also choose to utilize a motorcycle wheel chock, but in many applications it is not required.Make sure you have ratchet straps or tie downs to properly secure the motorcycle. Bungee chords will not suffice.
Soft loops and ratchet straps can be purchased at many large retail stores, auto parts stores or motorcycle specialty stores.

, If you opt to use wheel chocks, you should place one in front of and behind the rear wheel. As the motorcycle is transported, it may rock forward and backward, and the chocks will help prevent too much pressure from being placed on the ratchet straps.Wheel chocks are recommended for heavier motorcycles such as cruisers and grand touring bikes.
Some motorcycle wheel chocks are shaped like a “U” and are designed to hold the entire front or rear tire.

, With the bike in position on the trailer or in the truck, hang two ratchet straps from the handle bars (one on each side). Secure the opposite end of each strap to a loop or hook on the trailer or truck that is further back than the handlebars so the straps hang at an angle from the front of the bike to the back of the truck or trailer. Tighten the straps enough until they are taut, but you will need to tighten them further once the back of the bike is strapped down as well.The ratchet straps should be secured on either side of the truck or trailer to hooks that are further back than the handle bars.
Optimally, the straps should be a forty-five degree angle from the motorcycle if viewed from above.

, Take the soft loop strap and connect it to a ratchet strap by placing the strap’s hook through the loop. Run the loop through or around a portion of the rear of the motorcycle such as around the swing arm or even through the empty space of the wheel. Secure the other end of the strap to a hook or loop at the front of the truck bed or trailer.If your wheels have spokes, it is not recommended that you run the soft loop through them, as the tension may damage the spokes.
Even with the soft loop, you may want to place a rag between the loop and any painted surfaces on the motorcycle to prevent scratches or scrapes in the paint during transit.

, With all of the straps in place, ask your friend to press down firmly on the handlebars with all of their weight as you use the ratchet to tighten the straps. Your front suspension should be compressed (lowering the height of the motorcycle) while it is being transported. Tighten the rear strap once the front two are all the way tightened. The three straps should now prevent the motorcycle from moving forward, backward or left to right.The motorcycle should be standing without the kickstand when the straps are tight enough.
Do not strap the motorcycle down with the kickstand down, as it may damage the trailer or the bed of the truck and will force the motorcycle to sit at an angle.

Contact local shipping companies for a price quote.,
Choose between open and enclosed shipping options.,
Identify the end location.,
Ask about the insurance protecting the motorcycle en route.,
Inspect your motorcycle for signs of damage upon receipt.",How to Transport a Motorcycle3," There are a number of national and regional companies that can ship your motorcycle, but you want to make sure you get a good deal from a reputable business. Start by looking up local shipping companies online or in the phone book. Once you find some you like, contact them to get a price quote on shipping your motorcycle.You should try to get at least three quotes to ensure you have an understanding of a reasonable price.
The distance you are transporting the motorcycle, the size and weight of the motorcycle, and the timeframe will all affect the price of shipping a motorcycle.

, Open and enclosed shipping options refer to the type of trailer your motorcycle will be housed in as it travels. Enclosed trailers will protect your motorcycle from the elements and from dirt and grime on the road. Open trailers offer less protection, but often come at a significantly lower price point.Consider the time of year and region your motorcycle will travel through when choosing between enclosed and open trailers. If your motorcycle will be exposed to extreme heat or inclement weather, you may choose an enclosed trailer option.
Remember that an open trailer may be left out in the elements for hours or days, regardless of weather.

, Some shipping companies tout door to door delivery service, while others expect you to come pick up your motorcycle at a designated location. Having the motorcycle shipped directly to your house may be more convenient, but will also likely cost more.Remember that the motorcycle will likely be transported by tractor trailer, so door to door shipping may not be feasible if the end location cannot be accessed by a truck of that size.
Shipping your motorcycle to the closest major city will likely cost significantly less than shipping it to your door.

, While the motorcycle is being transported by a shipping company, their insurance or bond should cover any damages to your bike, as well as theft. However, different companies have different policies and you may be left responsible for a deductible if something were to happen to your motorcycle. Ask to see the shipping company’s insurance agreement and inquire about what to do if damages were to occur.Make sure to ask about any deductible you may be responsible for if the motorcycle is damaged while in transit.
If the shipping company does not have insurance, you should consider seeking a different shipping company.

, When your motorcycle arrives, look it over for any signs of damage and address it with the shipping company. The company may reimburse you for the cost of repairs or pay for the repairs at a designated facility, depending on the situation and their insurance coverage. Make sure to take pictures of the damage to substantiate your claim.Contact the shipping company directly to discuss the damages.
Make sure to keep copies of any paperwork you complete regarding the damages until they have been repaired.

Purchase a reliable off road vehicle, such as a Jeep Wrangler.
,
Adapt the vehicle by lifting the vehicle, that is, adjusting the suspension.,
Install accessory items to improve safety and vehicle toughness.,
Purchase large tires.,
Take your vehicle to a legal off-roading trail.,
Start out slowly until you get the hang of the terrain.,
Remain calm in all situations.,
Build your skill and confidence.,
Experience as many terrains and trails as possible.",How to Go Off Roading in an SUV,", Lifting the vehicle allows more freedom for the tires to move under the wheel wells.

Higher quality suspension systems like Jeep's Rubicon or Rubicon Express allow the axles and tires to articulate and move in relation to objects, thereby supplying much improved traction.



 


The most common lift ranges are 1-4 inches (3-10 cm).
If you do not lift the vehicle, there is reduced body-to-tire clearance and increased risk of damage to the undercarriage, frame and suspension. On the other hand, too much lift will cause the vehicle to be top heavy and is, generally, not very practical.







, Skid plates, ""Nerf"" bars and roll cages can help protect you and your vehicle while out on the trail.

,


Large tires add extra ground clearance and allow for a smoother ride and better handling.
Surfaces of the trails greatly and these may require differing tread designs. The universal or ""knobby"" tires are a minimum requirement and provide a good starting tire for most off roading trails.
Tires ranging from 29 to 35 inches (75-90 cm) in height will be sufficient for most off-roading adventures.
These tires are also designed to run at a very low pressure (5-15psi or 35-100kPa). Low tire pressures are preferred for flexing around tight spots and corners in the trail. The low pressures generally give more traction and the tires are less likely to be punctured by sharp rocks and other debris.

, Many trails can be found in books, online and through your local group or club. Trails range greatly in difficulty: The novice should start with easy or medium trails.


Easy trails are usually just basic off-asphalt trails and require no technical or extraordinary handling experience. Any four wheel drive (FWD) or all wheel drive (AWD) vehicle should be able to easily navigate these trails.
Medium difficulty trails will likely be relatively mild with no extreme grades and only a few more technical obstacles. A small SUV is recommended,— one, preferably, with after market tires and/or suspension.
Hard trails should be left to the well seasoned and experienced off roader. Once your vehicle is prepared with after market tires and suspension, the vehicle should be outfitted with a roll cage. Roll cages should be considered a necessity and should be installed before you attempt this class of difficulty.

, Rocks can move, boulders can be slippery and water driving can be tricky. Each can be more intense than anticipated.

, Observe the terrain, obstacles and upcoming features closely and react with a level head. Going slowly allows you more time to react to your changing environment. Remember, off-roading isn't a race. It requires technical driving, some finesse and large measures of patience and restraint to maintain a constant, slow speed and ""crawl"" the terrain successfully., Try tackling some hills and a couple of rock beds. They offer a slippery surface and a stiffer challenge when attempting to crawl your vehicle. Once you build confidence and ability, your off-road driving experience can go one of two ways.— It will only get easier or it will become more challenging ans intense. The choice is yours. You should look expand your horizons and attempt new challenges.

When driving on more challenging rock beds, always have a spotter outside your vehicle to help you with wheel placement. A spotter is a person that looks for what you are unable to see from inside the vehicle and will help guide wheel placement.






When driving on sand, snow or ice, loss of control is also a possibility. Drive much more slowly than normal and use snow chains or studded tires to greatly improve performance and ease of handling. On these surfaces, you will need to keep tires from spinning by providing the best traction possible and changing your speed gradually. That is, accelerate from a dead stop to speed and decelerate from speed to a stop should be slow, even and gradual.






On sand, knobby tires can greatly increase traction. As the tires spin, they act as paddles to propel you forward or backward. Still, no matter the tire type, you cannot spin too much. There is a very real danger of sinking your tires in the sand and it can happen before you know it. Increase your awareness and, if this starts to happen, stop before you are more than a few inches deep (especially if you aren't actually moving any at all). Try backing up, or rocking the vehicle out of the depression before it becomes a crater.







, The best way to learn how to traverse all kinds of obstacles and surfaces is to try it— learn by doing. Up the difficulty of your playground and don't be discouraged if things become tougher than you expected. Respond to the challenges as best you can, then listen to the experienced off-roaders. They may offer suggestions about how to better spend your time on the trail or to more easily surmount recent challenges you have faced.


If you are unable to complete a section of the trail, other drivers on the trail will probably be willing to help you navigate the obstacles by spotting or will give you advice.
Forcing your way through an obstacle or trail, may damage your vehicle. Remember: Your vehicle should survive the ordeal with little or no damage and live to off road another day. Your vehicle will be needed to carry you and yours safely home from the trail and is likely used around town too, so avoid powering through difficult situations.

Vacuum the leather on your motorcycle before you start to clean it.,
Use cleaners that are specifically for leather.,
Rinse your leather using water and a clean cloth or sponge.,
Apply leather conditioner once the leather is completely washed and dried.,
Use petroleum jelly on your leather jackets, pants and chaps.",How to Maintain Your Motorcycle's Leather Accessories,"


You can use a vacuum hose on the bigger areas and a narrower attachment on the crevices. You can also use anything that blows air, such as a computer keyboard air duster to get any dust or crumbs out. Getting rid of all little particles will prevent them from scratching your leather when you use the leather cleaner.;
,


Be sure to use the correct type of cleaner for your motorcycle accessories. Look for one that does not contain alkaline or any acid as these may cause your leather to dry. Do not use regular soap or detergents on your leather because they can dry the leather as well, and take off the natural oil that makes your leather shine.

,


Be sure to rinse thoroughly and to let the leather dry slowly at room temperature. Do not use a blow dryer or any other heated appliance to try to dry your leather quicker.

,


Using conditioner on wet or dirty leather will trap the dirt or water into the leather and cause it to degrade faster. Leather conditioner will help keep your bike's leather moisturized. It also helps to prevent pollutants in the environment from damaging the leather.
You can also choose a conditioner specifically for your needs. There are leather conditioners that have ingredients that are antimicrobial and help preserve your leather. There are also those that provide waterproofing.
Use a small amount of conditioner and a soft clean cloth to rub it into the motorcycle's leather. Once you have covered all the leather, let it sit for about 1/2 hour to let it absorb. You can choose to apply a second layer or just wipe off any extra with a clean cloth.

,


Many riding accessories are made of leather and you may want to maintain those as well. If your leather clothes start to look as though they are drying, wipe a very small amount of petroleum jelly all over the garment. Let it dry before applying another layer.

Determine helmet shape.,
Wrap the flexible measuring tape around your head.,
Read the measurement off the tape.,
Determine helmet type.,
Select a helmet designed to fit your head circumference.,
Try the helmet on.,
Adjust the helmet's chin strap.,
Try additional padding.,
Inspect before use.",How to Measure Helmet Size," You should consider helmet shape before measuring for helmet size. This is especially important if you are looking for a motorcycle helmet. There are three main types of shapes, which are long oval, intermediate oval, and round oval. The helmet shape matters for most helmet types, though it is more important for motorcycle and riding helmets.Long oval means that the shape of the head, and helmet, is longer front-to-back than side-to-side.
Intermediate oval means that the shape of the helmet will be slightly longer from front-to-back than from side-to-side. This is the most common shape.
A round oval shape is one that is almost equal from front-to-back as it is side-to-side.;
, You should position it just above your eyebrows. Make sure the measuring tape lays flat against your head but doesn't pinch. It should be level all the way around.Doing this on your own is a challenge. Ask a friend or family member for help, or use a mirror to help you level the tape.
If you're measuring your head circumference on your own, cross the ends of the tape on the front of your head to make reading the measurement easier.

, Take several measurements. The largest measurement you take is the measurement to go by. Write down this measurement so that you will remember it when it comes to choosing a helmet., The type of helmet you choose depends on what you need it for. Each type of helmet is designed to withstand the specific types and forces of impact unique to that sport. For example, don't wear a bicycle helmet for climbing, or a batting helmet on your motorcycle. In some instances, there may be multiple types of helmet for one sport, like biking.A mountain bike helmet is made specifically for an off-road terrain.
A road helmet is lightweight and compact for aerodynamic advantages.
A BMX bike helmet is made to fit the demands of BMX racing.
A leisure helmet is a helmet made without more advanced features.

, Most helmets are designed to fit a range of head circumference measurements. Most helmet manufacturers list the head circumference prominently on the helmet packaging. You may see a size designation--small, medium or large--that correlates with a helmet sizing chart that lists head circumference measurements.

, Try the helmet on before purchasing to make sure it fits correctly. The helmet should cover both your forehead and the back of your head. If you put it on and shake your head front and back or side to side, the helmet shouldn't wobble in either direction. And if somebody puts their hand on top of the helmet and twists it, your head should go with the helmet. If the helmet twists freely on your head, it's too loose.

, If the helmet requires a chin strap, check it before use. It should fit snugly, but not pinch. The chin strap shouldn't restrict your ability to breathe, swallow, or speak. It should not, however, be so loose that you can easily fit a finger between the strap and your chin.

, Many helmets come with removable padding that can be washed after use to keep them hygienic. It is also an option to buy additional padding to add to the helmet. You should only buy additional padding if you can not find a helmet that fits you snugly and properly., Check the helmet or have it inspected before each use. The helmet should not be cracked, missing foam, or damaged in any way. If the helmet is damaged, do not use it. Instead, return it to the store, or send it back to the manufacturer.If you must return the helmet, do not ride, bike, or play until you receive another one.

Purchase your bike.",How to Get a Motorcycle Loan," Before you submit a motorcycle loan application, consider taking a look at your credit report. Lenders see motorcycles as risky because bikes are frequently stolen or crashed. As a result, lending requirements are more strict with motorcycles than with cars.


If you have one slight blip on your credit report you may get declined. It is best to study your credit report before submitting an application and if you find inaccurate information, have it fixed before submitting an application.






Lenders do not like to see high credit card debt when looking at motorcycle loans. If you have high credit card debt it is highly recommended you pay off some of your debt before applying.





;
, Before you apply for a loan, you should understand your budget and how much you can afford.


Don’t stretch yourself so far in debt that it is difficult to make your loan payments. You may find it necessary to accept a less desirable motorcycle to afford the loan, but at least you still get to ride.







, Avoiding common mistakes is the key to having a good experience when financing a bike. Some of those mistakes include being afraid to ask question about the loan, borrowing too much, and opting for a credit card motorcycle loan.

, Make sure you not only shop for a loan in a dealership, but you also shop online motorcycle lenders, your local bank and credit union. Here are some general financing options:



Dealer Financing: Most motorcycle dealerships will offer financing directly to consumers. Interest rates will fluctuate depending on the applicant, based on your credit history.







OEM Financing: OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers—Harley, Yamaha, etc.) usually have financing available to purchase new bikes. Interest rates will fluctuate based upon your credit history, financial standing and any current OEM promotions.







Credit Card: If you have an existing credit card with a high enough line of credit, you can make your motorcycle purchase using that card. The benefits include no credit checks, financing applications, or pre-payment penalties, but be prepared for a significantly higher interest rate. Be aware of the current interest rate on your credit card and how this compares to your other financing options.







Personal Loan: Your local banking institution or credit union may or may not provide motorcycle loans, but if you currently have a mortgage with your loan provider, you may qualify for reduced interest rate personal loans.







Cash: You remember cash, don't you? It's that green stuff that comes out of ATM machines. Benefits include no monthly payments or finance charges. There are no drawbacks, per se, other than taking that cash being gone from your assets.







, To find the best interest rate and terms you should shop at least 4 lenders.


When credit shopping, you should do it all in a couple days time to ensure it does not hurt your credit score.






Be wary of loans that require you to put your house up as collateral. You never want to put that at risk for a bike. Motorcycle loans will not have these in the terms, but some may.






You can look many places for these loans. A local motorcycle shop may have options, your bank or credit union will, and you can even find a motorcycle loan online. Your needs are different from others, so some loans may be better or worse for you.






For those with less than stellar credit, there are lenders who will take a risk with you. However, be prepared to pay a significantly higher interest rate should that be the case.







, After you comparison shop you will want to select the best motorcycle loan quote to fit your need. You will want to consider the interest rate, and the terms of the loan.


The longer your loan, the lower your payment, but this will also mean you have less equity in your bike if you decide to sell it in 2 years, plus you will end up paying more for it in the long run as interest rates mount up.






Determine if the loan terms have a prepayment penalty and look at the details of fees to ensure you are selecting the best terms.







, This is where the fun begins and you get to purchase a new bike and enjoy the motorcycling lifestyle.

Check your rearview mirror and look behind your vehicle before backing out of the parking space.,
Put your vehicle in reverse and slowly begin backing up when it is safe.,
Turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the rear of your vehicle to go as you reverse.,
Apply the brakes and straighten up the steering wheel once your vehicle is all the way out of the parking spot.,
Put your vehicle in drive, release the brake, and slowly drive forward.",How to Park Safely in Small Space," For an easier time parking, look for a parking space with another empty one next to it so that you don’t have to worry about getting too close to another parked car. If that isn’t possible, select the first empty parking space you find.


If you are driving an SUV, a large truck, or an oversized vehicle, you should not attempt to park in a small space. Smaller parking spaces are best limited to smaller vehicles, such as compact cars.
Attempting to park a large vehicle in a small space runs the risk of bumping into or scraping against another parked vehicle because there is no wiggle room, so to speak.;
, The bumper of your vehicle should be lined up with the middle of the parking space immediately before the one you will be parking in.

, This lets other drivers know that you are about to park. When they know you are planning to park, they can stop and give you space to safely park your vehicle.

, Even though you are not reversing, it is a good idea to check your mirrors before pulling into the parking space. You want to be sure that any vehicles behind you have stopped.


If you observe a vehicle trying to pass you, wait until it is has passed before proceeding to park.

, Once you have checked your mirrors as described in the previous step, if you have folding mirrors it is a good idea to fold in both the driver and passenger side mirrors before pulling into the parking space.


In small parking spaces, vehicles parked next to run another run the risk of having the driver and/or passenger mirrors bump one another.
Folding your driver and passenger side mirrors in will protect them from being broken off by other vehicles whose driver’s might not park as carefully as you.

, Your turn signal should still be on at this point. It will likely turn itself off soon as you continue turning the wheel.

, Take your time and pull in slowly. Always be extra cautious when parking in small, narrow spaces.


If there is a vehicle parked in the space next to the driver side of your car and that vehicle is extremely close to the line between parking spaces, park your car closer to the opposite side of your parking space. This will leave more room on the driver’s side so that you can safely open your door without hitting the other vehicle when getting out of your car.
If the vehicles parked on either side of you are positioned in the center of their spaces, then you can also park your car in the middle of your spot rather than leaving extra space on the driver’s side.

, When you are fully in the parking space you want to be sure your steering wheel is straightened back into its original position. This will make it easier to back out of the space later when you leave.

, If there is a vehicle parked directly in front of your space (it will probably be facing your vehicle, unless it was backed in), be careful not to bump it as you pull all the way in.

, Upon exiting the vehicle, take caution when opening your door. In small parking spaces, there is not always enough room to open your car door all the way without hitting the vehicle next to yours.

, You want to be sure there are no pedestrians walking past and that no other vehicles are in the way.


If you folded your side mirrors in when parking, open them before reversing if you have enough room to do so.
If your were able to open the side mirrors or if they were already open, check both to be sure the coast is clear before reversing.

, You will still need to continuously watch for pedestrians and other vehicles the entire time you are reversing out of the parking space.

, Remember to continue watching out for people and other vehicles as you back up.

, Do not release the brakes until the next step. You do not want your vehicle to accidentally roll further backward once you are completely clear of the parking space.


If you were side mirrors were folded and you were not able to open them prior to backing out, go ahead and open them now before continuing.

, You have now successfully pulled into and backed out of a small parking space.

Locate the lever on the left side of the steering column.The turn signal is a long lever, usually black or gray in color.,
Use the turn signal to indicate a turn to the left.,
Indicate a right-hand turn with the turn signal.To signal a right turn, wait until you are within about 30 yards of the corner you wish to round.,
Ensure your turn signal turns off after your turn has been completed.,
Signal your turn even if you are in a turning lane.,
Don’t turn your turn signal on too soon.Only activate your turn signal when there are no intervening streets or alleys between you and the place you wish to turn.",How to Use Your Turn Signal1," When moved up or down, this lever will cause a light on either the left or right side of your car to flash.


The turn signal will not make a sound or light the signal light on your car unless the car is running.;
, To signal a left turn, wait until you are approximately 30 yards from the corner around which you intend to turn.Ensure you are in the left-turn lane, then push the turn signal lever down gently with your left hand. When the turn signal locks in place, you’ll be able to see a flashing arrow directed to the left on your instrument cluster. You’ll also hear a tick-tock sound which clicks in time with the flashing of the light. This indicates that the signal is operating properly. Return your hand to the steering wheel and continue driving.


Keep your right hand on the wheel while flicking the signal lever down with your left hand.
Turn on the signal before braking to let other drivers know why you are slowing.

, Ensure you are in the right-turn lane, then move the lever up with your left hand. The series of events which follow are similar to those which occur when making a signal to turn towards the left.


Once you have moved the lever up, an arrow light will begin blinking on the dashboard instrument cluster. You will also hear a metronome-like sound at regular intervals which clicks in time with the flashing light on your instrument cluster.

, Normally, the signal will automatically turn off after you have made the turn. Some turns which are at angles of less than ninety degrees, however, might not trigger the automatic suspension of the turn signal after you’ve made the turn. Failing to turn your turn signal off after you have completed a turn can be illegal and cause confusion for other drivers.It is easy to see if your turn signal is still on after you’ve made a turn. Just check the indicator panel above and just behind your steering wheel. Listen for the rhythmic tick-tock sound of the signal blinking on and off. If you see the indicator light blinking or hear the signal sound, reach over to the signal lever with your left hand and gently move it to the “off” position.

, Some traffic lanes are reserved for left or right turns only. While it might seem unnecessary to indicate you’re turning when it should be obvious based on the lane you’re in, use the turn signal anyway. Drivers who are not familiar with the area or who cannot see the signs due to multiple vehicles ahead of them in the lane will appreciate the indication as to where you are headed, and could clue them into the fact that your lane is for turning in a given direction. Plus, the law requires that you make a turn with your turn signal.

, If you turn your signal on too soon, someone might think you are turning into a parking lot or down a street which you actually are not. This confusion could lead to an accident or to you being cut off.

Use your turn signal when pulling out from the curb.Before leaving a parking spot on the side of the street, it is important to indicate you’re about to merge into traffic.,
Get on a highway with your turn signal.,
Exit the highway with your turn signal.,
Indicate when you wish to change lanes with your turn signal.",How to Use Your Turn Signal2," After getting in your car, activate your turn signal in the direction you wish to merge. For instance, if you are parked on the right side of the street and you wish to merge into the lane parallel to your vehicle on the left side, activate your left-hand turn signal by pulling down on the signal lever.


Check your side mirror to ensure there is space in the flow of traffic to pull out, then turn your wheel hard to the left and accelerate gently.
Return the signal lever to the neutral (starting) position by pushing up gently on it.

, When merging onto the highway, accelerate quickly so that you attain the speed appropriate for highway driving. About halfway down the on-ramp, flick your left-hand turn signal on. This will demonstrate that you want to get over, but remember, you do not have the right-of-way when merging. Be careful when merging into high-speed traffic.


While some highways are constructed in such a way that there is no other option but to merge, some on-ramps turn into independent lanes which connect to the next exit if it is nearby. In either case, using your turn signal will alert other highway drivers to your desire to merge, and will give them time to slow down or change lanes in order to let you do so.
Look out your left-side window when merging into highway traffic, that way, you can see where cars are relative to you, and will be able to time your merge better. Check your rear-view mirror and left side mirror as you merge in order to identify a gap in the flow of traffic.
Once you’ve found your gap, merge quickly to the left.Spend no more than 2-3 seconds moving from the on-ramp to the highway proper.

, If you need to get off the highway, position yourself in the far-right lane on the highway. If your exit ramp is on the left, position yourself in the far-left lane of the highway. Turn the appropriate turn signal on when you’re about 100 yards from the off-ramp. Do not slow down as you approach the off-ramp.Only modify your speed and adjust your turn-signal once you are on the off-ramp.


Once you’ve hit the off-ramp, adjust your turn signal lever to indicate your next move. If you’re going straight, place it in the neutral position. If you’re turning left, press the lever down. If turning right, you can keep your signal on in the right-hand turn position all the way to the end of the off-ramp.

, If, for instance, you are in the right lane and want to change to the left lane, you can do easily and safely by employing your turn signal.


First, put your turn signal on in the direction you wish to go. To move into the right lane, push your turn signal up to let others know you wish to move to the right. To move into the left lane, push your turn signal lever down to indicate that you wish to move into the left lane.
Activate the turn signal at least five seconds before you wish to change lanes.Don’t switch the signal on for just one or two flickers. Place it in the locked position just as you would when making a turn.
If all is clear, turn your wheel slightly toward the lane you wish to merge into. Once you’re completely within the boundaries of the lane, move your left hand to your turn signal lever and switch it off.
Do not cross multiple lanes of traffic with a single activation of your turn signal. If you know you need to cross many lanes, give yourself the adequate time and space to do so. Plan your lane merges ahead of time.

Look before you make a quick stop, if you can.",How to Use the Rear View Mirror," Before you adjust your mirror, you want to make sure that your seat is in the right position for driving. Move the seat forward or back, adjust the seat back, and move the seat up or down, if your seat has that type of adjustment.


It's important to adjust the seat so that you can easily reach the pedals of the car. Make sure your feet can reach the gas pedal, the brake pedal, and, if you have one, the clutch pedal.;
, With your seatbelt buckled, you will be in your final driving position. If you adjust your mirrors before buckling you seatbelt, you may be in a different position when actually driving.


It is important for your safety to always drive with your seatbelt buckled.

, You want to assure that you can see the traffic behind you clearly. You should be able to see the road behind you, with the horizon line and a bit of the space above the horizon line visible as well.To be able to do this, make sure that you can see your whole rear window in your rearview mirror.To adjust the mirror simply move the body of the mirror to a different angle. The mirror should move easily, although not so easily that it falls out of place once you position it.
Don't adjust the mirror so that you can see out one side of the rear window more than another. This will only limit your overall vision of the road. If you are concerned about seeing one side of the car, you should use your side view mirrors for that., If you feel that your mirror needs additional adjustment after you start driving, make this adjustment while stopped. It can be a hazard to adjust the mirror while in motion, as you should be focused on your driving and the traffic around you.


While driving, the vibration of the vehicle can cause the position of the rearview mirror to change. Pay attention to its position as you drive and adjust it as needed when stopped.

, To be safe, take the time to adjust the rearview mirror before every drive. It is not enough to rely on your positioning from last time your drove. You may have been sitting in a slightly different position or someone else could have adjusted the mirror without you knowing., Even if you are just driving straight ahead on an open highway, it's important to know what is going on behind you. This means you should be looking at your rearview mirror every 5-8 seconds.This will keep your understanding of the traffic conditions behind you up to date.
It will also allow you to keep track of cars that are passing you, and even cars that are acting sporadically or dangerously behind you.

, You should look in the mirror before you stop or start, pass a car, turn, switch lanes, pull over, or make any other adjustment to your position on the road. Basically, if you want to make any movements, other than straight ahead, you should check your rearview mirror before doing it, so that you can make the change safely.


When changing lanes, you use a combination of your rearview mirror and your side mirror to see if where you are moving is clear, as well as turning around to see if there is anyone in your blind spot. The combination of all of these checks will make switching lanes safer., The rear-view mirror is especially important when you are moving your vehicle in reverse. The mirror will help you to know the course is clear and that you can move without coming into contact with another car, person, or property.


When moving in reverse, it is also important to rely on things other than the rear-view mirror. Check your side mirrors and turn around and look behind the car with your own eyes in order to assess the situation. After all, it is always better to be safe than sorry.

, The rearview mirror can give you a lot of good information when trying to get through a stressful and busy driving situation. For example, look in your mirror to assess whether moving in reverse will help you get out of a tight space or just lock you into a even more tenuous position.

, Before you brake hard, take a quick second to assess whether any cars are too close to your rear end to stop. If that is the case, consider adjusting your lane or your braking speed if you can. If you can't, then knowing a car behind you may hit you will give you a second to brace for an impact.


If you are looking in your rearview mirror at regular intervals already, you may already have a good idea if a vehicle is close behind you. This will help you to make a quick judgement about the following distance and if a vehicle will have time to stop before hitting you.
Being good at judging the following distance of vehicles behind you should help you adjust your braking measures in order to prevent a rear-end collision from happening.

Hold the wheel with both hands.,
Keep your grip firm.,
Hold the wheel at at ""10-and-2"" or ""9-and-3."",
Mind your thumbs.",How to Steer Your Car1," Be ready to negotiate split-second emergencies. Maintain as much control as possible over the car at all times. If your car has a manual transmission, shift gears when needed, but do not keep a needless grip on the gearshift afterward. Instead, return your hand to the steering wheel immediately.Turning on your windshield wipers, headlights, and turning signals also require you to remove one hand from the wheel.But these controls are typically located close to the steering wheel to minimize the time spent driving one-handed.
Reversing the car is an exception to this rule.;
, Resist the urge to slacken your grip on the wheel. At the same time, be careful not to clench the wheel too tensely. This can tire your arms out and possibly obscure warning signs that reverberate through the steering wheel.”Feeling” the car through the steering wheel is another important reason to steer with both hands.

, Picture the steering wheel as an old-fashioned clock with 12 o’clock as the apex of the wheel. With your left hand, hold the wheel at either 9 or 10 o’clock. Then hold the other side at either 3 or 2 o’clock with your right.10-and-2 is better suited for older cars or any others with larger steering wheels and no power steering.
9-and-3 has become the new norm for modern cars equipped with power steering, smaller steering wheels, and airbags.

, While driving on paved roads, hold the wheel with your thumbs hooked around the steering wheel. If you turn off-road, remove your thumbs. Place them along the steering wheel's rim, as if you were giving two thumbs-up.Hooking your thumbs under the rim while driving off-road may set you up for injury. Your tires could strike obstacles hard enough to jolt the steering wheel in your hand.If you are driving on a paved road with your hands at 9-and-3, nestle your thumbs along the wheel's spokes where they meet the rim.

Start with the push-and-pull technique.,
Move on to rotational steering.,
Master steering in reverse.",How to Steer Your Car2," Pull the steering wheel down in the direction that you wish to turn (for left turns, pull with your left hand, and vice versa). As you pull the steering wheel down, relax your other hand. Bring it down along the wheel to meet your “pulling” hand above your crotch. When they meet, relax your “pulling” hand and let your other hand take over. Push the steering wheel up until the turn has been executed.When you are first learning how to drive, start with this technique to make turns, since it is a cinch to master.Favor this technique while driving off-road or in dense areas with frequent sharp turns and heavy traffic. Doing so will give your hands freer access to such tools as your gearshift and turn signals.
Also favor this technique with larger steering wheels and/or in cars without power steering.
Push-and-pull is also referred to as the “shuffle” technique.

, Turn the wheel in the direction you wish to turn your vehicle. Maintain a 9-and-3 or 10-and-2 grip on the wheel as you do so. If you need to turn the wheel more than 90 degrees to finish your turn, relax whichever hand is now directly above your crotch and keep it there. Continue to turn the wheel with your “top” hand until it meets your “bottom” hand above your crotch. At that point, bring your “bottom” hand up to the top of the wheel. Continue pulling the wheel down to complete the car’s turn.Use this technique for slight changes in direction, such as changing lanes.
Favor this technique when driving highways or other open roads at higher speeds.
Rotational steering is sometimes referred to as fixed-input steering.

, Check all of your mirrors to make sure the rear of the car is free of people and obstacles. Place one arm around the back of the side-passenger seat. Twist your upper torso in that direction by 90 degrees for a better view through the rear window. Grip the steering wheel at roughly 12 o’clock with your other hand. To back the car up to its right, turn the steering wheel to its right, and vice versa.Keep in mind that you will have a limited view of the driver’s side of the car while in this position.
If possible, allow the car to roll backwards under its own momentum. If gas is needed, only apply a little pressure on the pedal at a time. Avoid backing up too fast.
Do not rely on mirrors or rearview cameras alone to steer in reverse.

"
"
Adjust your seat and steering column properly.,
Look farther down the road.,
Factor in your speed when steering.,
Keep “dry steering” to a minimum.,
Practice safe one-handed steering.",How to Steer Your Car3," Fix their relative height and distance so that you can sit comfortably. Don’t set your seat so far back that you have to lean forward to grip the steering wheel. Avoid placing undue stress on your body, which may tire you out and distract you, making you less responsive.The positioning of your seat may effect which grip you find more comfortable: 9-and-3 or 10-and-2. Taller people, for instance, may find 10-and-2 most comfortable, due to the limits of how much they can adjust either the steering column or their seat.

, Extend your sights at least a half-mile to a mile farther up the road. Keep your eyes peeled for any curves, hazards, or other factors that may necessitate a change in direction. Anticipate when you need to turn early on. Give yourself as much time as possible to plan and execute changes in direction.If you are passing through a tight curve that significantly reduces your field of vision, always focus on the farthest point that you can see ahead of you.
Trust your peripheral vision to alert you to sudden changes that appear closer to hand.

, Anticipate that a change in direction at slow speed will require greater physical effort with the steering wheel. Be prepared to turn it by a greater number of degrees in low-speed areas like parking lots, residential streets, and urban neighborhoods. Conversely, keep your turning actions with the wheel very, very slight when driving fast. Expect a slight turn of the wheel to cause a very pronounced change of direction on high-speed roads like highways., Turning the steering wheel when the car is parked or otherwise at rest can have adverse effects on your tires and power-steering. Do so when necessary, such as when you parallel-park or execute a K-turn. Otherwise, try to avoid it., Maintain optimum control over the vehicle while using tools other than the steering wheel. Use your nearest hand to operate such functions as turn signals and gear shifts while driving. Keep your other hand where it is as you do so. Don’t risk letting go of the wheel to alter its position."

Pay Attention to Your Own Bad Habits.,
Be Aware of What You're Doing and How You're Doing It!,
Get Emotionally Bulletproof for Your Kids Mistakes.,
Use Student Driver Signs.",How to Stay Sane While Teaching Teens to Drive1," Before your kid gets behind the wheel, your teen will be watching you drive; even if you don't realize it. Once the child has an image in their head of how the parents drive they'll start to model the same behavior. So if you've got any bad habits like running red lights, rolling through stop signs, or speeding, this would be the time to stop. Most parents don't find their own bad habits stressful but find it drives them crazy their teen does the same thing. Once they start repeating your bad habits, and you ask them to stop, they're probably going to say ""but mom/dad, you do it."" So the easiest way to avoid this and stay sane is: just don't do them.;
, Many people are ""unconsciously competent"" when they drive; they do it without thinking about it. But if you have no conscious idea of what you're doing behind the wheel, how are you going to explain it to your teen when they ask what they should do? When you're driving around, make little ""mental notes"" about when you start braking, how fast you're driving in different situations, and where you're looking. When you have an idea of when, where, and what you're doing on the road, it's easier to recognize mistakes that your teen makes as early as possible. Which gives you both more time to deal with the road ahead.

, Driving with your kids is not going to be perfect all the time. Especially in the beginning things are going to be rocky. But there is hope. Research has shown that if we have as little as 10 seconds notice before something bad happens, we'll start to come up with coping strategies that make us feel less stressed out.{{fact} For example: if you're approaching a turn onto a side street, ask yourself ""how could this go wrong?"" Biggest problem in this type of situation is driving too fast, so you decide on an ""if-then"" scenario. ""If"" my kid is going over 20kph/12mph within a few moments of starting the turn, ""then"" I'll hold the wheel and tell them to keep driving straight. Practice mentally going through different ""if-then"" scenarios to feel ready for anything (and preserve your sanity) on the road.

, Some people hate the idea of having these, but learn to LOVE that people know your kid is learning. It can put your mind at ease and help you stay calm when you know that other drivers will attribute mistakes to someone learning rather than being a bad driver. You can get your own signs made at many sign shops, order them online, tape a handwritten note in the back window or use a government issued ""L"" (learner) sign.

The Biggest Source of Stress for Parents is: Loss of Control.,
Breathe.,
Drink Water.,
Know When to Open Your Mouth.,
Tone is Critical.,
Be Specific.,
Read Your Teen's Mind.,
Find Your Out.",How to Stay Sane While Teaching Teens to Drive2," Anything you can do to increase your feeling of control will usually help you and your teen drive calmly together. As the parent of a new driver one of the most important things you can do is increase your teens feeling of safety and control. Let them know you're there for them, and want to help them, even if it sounds like you're upset. Their sanity is your sanity. If the kids feel like you're micromanaging them, they don't feel in control, which stresses them out, which makes them drive worse, which stresses you out... and then the vicious cycle repeats itself.

, Many people hold their breath when they're nervous, which depletes the oxygen in your blood and is sure to leave you feeling stressed out. Whenever you feel stressed, take a few deep breaths. 2 seconds in, 2 second pause, 2 seconds out. Do that a couple of times and you'll feel your blood pressure start to drop. It almost seems too simple, but it can be incredibly effective.

, We all know drinking water is important to our health but in times of stress it also helps calm us down. Think about it, if you were being chased by a hungry animal and feeling stressed out, you wouldn't stop to take a drink of water until you're out of harm's way. Water helps send signals to our bodies that the danger has passed.

, If you're not helping your teen, you're distracting them. Only speak when they're doing something wrong or to give them simple praise. One more thing, don't speak in turns/intersections unless it's absolutely necessary. If kids are going to have trouble anywhere it's usually in a turn so if you don't have something driving related to say, don't say anything at all.

, You've probably heard ""it's not what you said, it's how you said it."" In the car your voice needs to be the security blanket that lets them know you've got their backs. Often, the words you're saying aren't helpful, but how you say them is helpful. If you speak in a calm and relaxing tone, your teen feels reassured and supported, which helps them stay calm and drive better. If they sound annoyed I know they need to be reassured, calmed, and receive supportive language. If they sound mad, they're probably feeling embarrassed, insecure, or maybe they felt like I was being critical.

, Parents often find it hard to drive calm with their kids because when they try to say something their child misinterprets the words and it seems like they're not listening. The parent might say something like, ""you didn't listen to me, I told you to slow down, why didn't you slow down!!?""

, When you're driving, decide well in advance what they should do when they reach upcoming situations. When they reach the situation, if their foot is over the brake then they are thinking about stopping. If their foot is over the gas, they're thinking about going. If they're looking at the lane they need to turn into but not at the car that's coming towards the intersections, don't yell at them. Just say something like ""do you see that white car?"" and usually that's enough to imply there's a problem (remember when you talk, they usually assume there's a problem).

, When you drive, having options is critical to your sanity. You need to be thinking about problems before they happen. All it takes is a little foresight, and you can be ready for almost anything your teen or traffic can throw at you.

Know the different categories of traffic signs.",How to Understand Traffic Signs1,"



Regulatory signs regulate the flow of traffic and movement. They come in an assortment of shapes and colors. The most common regulatory signs are stop, yield, do not enter, one way, speed limit and school zone signs.

Warning signs warn drivers of upcoming traffic hazards, dangerous roads, and other situations that require caution. They are generally yellow or orange and diamond-shaped.

Marker signs announce the route number of a highway/freeway or the direction a particular road can lead to. They are usually white or green. Route markers are blue with a red strip on top.

Guide signs inform drivers of destinations and distance, expressways and freeways, and work zones. They are generally rectangular and can come in a variety of colors.

Recreational and cultural interest signs are brown with white text, and they signal nearby points of interest. These are usually directed towards travelers, and highlight restaurants, gas stations, areas with potable water, lodging, land/water/winter recreation, and other services.

"
"
Stop signs are red and octagonal with white text.,
Yield signs are red and white.,
Speed limits indicate the speed that drivers should maintain on that street.,
Lane regulation signs are white and tell drivers that they can only or cannot turn in particular directions (left, right, u-turn).,
Movement regulation are white and tell drivers if they need to stay/shift lanes, merge, or keep towards a certain direction.

,
Selective exclusion signs include do not enter and wrong way signs, usually in the color of red.,
One way signs are white and indicate that traffic only flows in one direction on that particular street.

,
Parking regulation signs specify times when parking is prohibited on that section of the street.

,
Railroad crossing signs are white and X-shaped.",How to Understand Traffic Signs2," They tell drivers to come to a complete stop at the white line on the street. Drivers should look both ways to yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic before proceeding.


Each stop sign comes with a label at the bottom that indicates how many cars at the intersection have a stop sign.

Two-way signs tell you that two cars do; you and the car traveling opposite you on the same street. You must both yield to all cars on the cross street.

Three-way signs are generally only present at intersections that have three streets, so they function in the same way as four-way and all-way stop signs. The car that arrives at the intersection first can leave first after coming to a complete stop. If two cars arrive at the same time, the one on the right has the right of way.;
, They tell drivers to slow down and to prepare to stop if there are vehicles or pedestrians in the intersection.


An alternate version of a yield sign is a white rectangle that reads ""TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.""
Some yield signs specify stopping for pedestrians, or announce that there is a pedestrian crosswalk you must stop for.

, It's generally acceptable to go 5 miles (8.0 km) above or below the speed limit, but anything beyond that can earn you a traffic ticket.

, They also indicate if lanes are reserved for certain vehicles (e.g., taxis, buses, trucks, etc.)

,, They also specify if certain vehicles are prohibited on a street (e.g., buses, bicycles, vehicles with lugs, trucks, or motor vehicles); these are generally white.

,,, They indicate that railroad tracks are ahead, and drivers should prepare in case a train comes. This means not stopping in the middle of intersections and taking caution.

, You may need to merge lanes to adjust.

, They can also indicate the percent grade of the hill, which describes its slope., They may also point out bumps and dips, so slow down if you see those.


The ""NO CENTER STRIPE"" sign is generally orange and indicates that there is no paint separating your lane and the lane for the oncoming traffic.

, If your car is taller than the labeled height, do not proceed ahead.

, Proceed with caution and expect delays.

, Thus, you cannot be cited for driving at a different speed there.

;
, In a manual transmission car there are three pedals - the clutch, the brake and the accelerator/gas. It is essential that you have a firm grasp of which pedal is which before you begin driving.









The pedal on the far left is the clutch. It allows you to disengage the engine from the wheels while you are changing gears. It should be operated using your left foot.
The middle pedal is the brake and the pedal on the far right is the accelerator. Both of these pedals are operated using the right foot.
Remember that the order of these pedals does not change regardless of whether you are in a left hand drive or right hand drive vehicle.

, Before you can start the car, you will need to ensure that the car is in neutral. The car is in neutral when:










The gear shift is in the neutral position. You can tell it's in the neutral position if it feels loose to the touch and you can move it easily from side to side. If the gear shift is not in neutral, you can fix this by pressing down fully on the clutch and moving the shift into the central (neutral) position.

The clutch is fully depressed. If you prefer, you can also put the car in neutral by pressing down fully on the clutch with your left foot.

, Once the car is in neutral, you are ready to turn the key in the ignition and start the car. Just remember:









If you put the car into neutral by moving the gear shift into the neutral position, you can turn the key in the ignition without having to depress the clutch pedal.
However, if you put the car into neutral by simply pressing down on the clutch (while the shift is still in gear), you will need to hold the clutch down as you turn the key. Otherwise the car could lunge forward.

, Once the car is running, you will need to put the car into gear before you can start moving. (Unless your car is already in gear, in which case you can just skip to step 3). To put your car in gear, press down fully on the clutch.








, Keeping your foot pressed down on the clutch, move the gear shift into first gear. This is usually done by moving the gear shift to the left and then up - the number 1 should be clearly marked on the top left corner of the stick.








, Very slowly, begin inching your foot off the clutch pedal. Keep lifting your foot until the engine speed (or RPM) begins to drop and the car begins to move slowly forward. This is known as the ""biting point"".








, Once you find the biting point, it's time to start pressing down on the accelerator, slowly and gently.









As your right foot begins to press down on the accelerator, your left foot should continue to release the clutch, in a simultaneous motion.
If you complete this action correctly, the car will start to move forward and you will be driving in first gear.

, Be careful - if you release the clutch too quickly, the car will stall (stop running) and you will have to start the process again.









On the other hand, if you press down too hard on the accelerator before the clutch is fully released you may wear out the clutch, causing damage to your vehicle.
Don't worry though - you are bound to stall at least a couple of times when you're learning to drive a manual transmission car. Finding the perfect balance between releasing the clutch and depressing the accelerator takes practice.

, When your engine begins to race and sounds like it's under pressure (usually around 2500 to 3000 RPM - though this varies depending on the car), you will need to move up into second gear. To do this:









Take your right foot off the accelerator (if necessary) and use your left foot to fully depress the clutch.
Grab the gear shift and move it straight downwards into second gear - which should be clearly marked by the number 2 on the stick.

, You will need to follow a slightly different procedure for starting your manual transmission car if you are parked on a hill. This is necessary to prevent the car from rolling backwards.








, To perform a hill start using the brake pedal, begin with your left foot depressing the clutch and your right foot depressing the brake. Put the car into gear, release the hand brake, then lift your foot off the clutch until you find the biting point. Now release the brake (keeping the clutch at the biting point will prevent the car from rolling backwards) and press down on the accelerator, using slightly more gas than usual. Continue as normal.








, To perform a hill start using the hand brake, put your foot on the clutch and put the car into gear. Slowly release the clutch until you find the biting point, then release the hand brake. Once you have released the hand brake, put your foot on the accelerator and proceed as normal.

Take a few deep breaths whenever you feel road rage or anxiety and tension building when you are driving.
Take as many breaths as you need to calm yourself and feel relaxed.;
, You may find that your hands are clinched on the wheel, shoulders hunched, neck tight, and jaw tense. You can relax when driving if you do things that relieve the tension in your body.Shrug your shoulders up and down to relax them. Roll them forward and then backwards a few times.
Relax your jaw and forehead. Smiling, even briefly, can help you relax your facial muscles.
Turn your head slightly back and forth and left and right to release tension in your neck.
Do some hand and finger stretches when you are stopped at a red light.

, Being mindful means focusing your attention in the here and now, on driving and only driving. Focusing your mind completely on driving doesn’t give your mind much room to think about anything upsetting and can help you relax when you are driving.Take notice of all your senses as you drive. What do you hear, see, or smell? What does the car feel like?
Pay attention to how your body feels. You may say to yourself, “My shoulders feel tense and my stomach is queasy.”
Take notice of your thoughts and emotions. For example, you might think, “I feel worried and nervous. I keep thinking about getting on the highway.”
Allow yourself to experience your feelings without trying to stop them from happening.
Notice as the feelings slowly go away and how you feel as they do.

, It is easy to start saying things to yourself that increase your feelings of tension, stress, anger, and anxiety. You can relax when you are driving if you make an effort to think relaxing thoughts and talk to yourself in a calm way.For example , when someone is driving unsafely, you may want to say to yourself, “They cut me off! This is so frustrating! Driving makes me tense!”
Instead, think, “He’s not driving safe. I’m glad I don’t have to stay around him. I’ll move to this lane. He’s not interrupting my relaxing drive.”
Or, you may think to yourself, “I’m not good at driving in this traffic. Something bad is going to happen.”
Instead, try saying to yourself, “This is a chance for me to practice driving in traffic. I’ll do just fine.”

Give yourself plenty of time.,
Set up your car.Preparing your car for your drive before you get behind the wheel can help you relax when driving.Before you get in, make sure that you have adjusted your controls and set the car up for your drive.,
Turn on relaxing music.Some research suggests that listening to classical, pop, or other downbeat music while you are driving can calm you down.So turn off the rock and rap and put on some pop or R&B to relax when you are driving.,
Put your electronic devices away.,
Talk to your passengers.",How to Relax when Driving2," Rushing to get somewhere can make you nervous and anxious. Instead, you can relax when driving if you make sure that you leave in enough time to arrive at your destination without rushing.Allow time for accidents, traffic, detours, and other unexpected events that might make you late.
Plan your route in advance so that you don’t lose time trying to figure out which way to go.

,


Position your seat in a comfortable position. You should be able to sit in the driver’s seat comfortably and still easily reach the pedals and steering wheel.
Adjust your rearview and side mirrors so that you can see everything around you and don’t have to worry about adjusting them while you are driving.
If you are using GPS, go ahead and set your location and put the device somewhere that you can easily see it while driving.
Adjust any other controls or settings, like temperature, beforehand so that you can focus on driving once you get started.

,


Listening to more fast tempo music like rock can cause you to drive faster and get upset easier.
Try to set your radio station or music before you start driving so that you aren’t distracted while you are driving.

, The distractions of alarms, alerts, and notifications can distract you and cause you to become tense while you are driving.To be safe and to relax when you are driving, put your electronic on silent or at least out of reach.


You can lose focus on driving as you try to see who is contacting you or become anxious as the beeps and tones continue to go off.
Some phones and phone services have a ‘driving mode’ that can be used while you are driving to reduce your distractions.
If you need to, put your phone somewhere that you can’t reach it so you won’t be tempted to check it.

, Having a conversation about ways to help you stay calm when you are driving can eliminate some of the stress passengers can add to driving. Let your passengers know that you want to be relaxed while you are driving and tell them what they can do to help.


Ask your passengers to wear their seatbelt, try to be still, and talk calmly to you.
For example, you could say, “While I’m driving please don’t yell at me or try to get things out of the backseat. It makes me nervous.”
Talk to children about how they should behave when they are passengers in a car.
You might say, “Kids, you should sit back, stay in your seatbelt, talk quietly, and no horseplay. This will keep you safe and me relaxed.”

Be confident when driving in new situations.You may find yourself in a situation where you have to drive in conditions you aren’t used to.,
Use caution in inclement weather.,
Be alert when driving at night.,
Accept it when you are running late.,
Stop other people in the car from distracting you.,
Stay calm around rude drivers.",How to Relax when Driving3," For example, you may have to take the highway when you are used to driving on residential streets. You can relax when driving in new situations if you remain confident in your driving ability.


Remember that you know the basic rules of driving and that they are generally the same, regardless of the situation.
You might say to yourself, “This is a new situation, but I’m a safe driver and can handle this.”
For example, if you are driving in a construction zone for the first time, you might remind yourself, “I can do this. I’m confident in my driving ability.”

, At some time or another you will likely have to drive when it is raining, snowing, or very windy. You can relax when you are driving in bad weather, however, if you stay alert and drive with caution.If the weather is very bad, for example, there are high winds and hail, try to avoid driving at all.
Make sure your headlights, brake lights, and windshield wipers are working before you leave.
Reduce your speed so that you can have time to react to anything that comes up when you are driving.
Pay attention and look for road hazards like fallen tree branches or flooding roadways.

, You can relax when you are driving at night if make sure that you are focused and paying attention to what is going on around you.Look out for motorists and pedestrians that may be hard to see at night. Use your mirrors often and look around ahead of you.
Make sure your headlights are on and that your brake lights work before you start driving.
Don’t drive when you are tired or sleepy.

, There will be times when, no matter how hard you try, you end up running late. Instead of getting nervous and trying to rush to get there, notify the appropriate person you will be late and accept it. This will help you relax when driving much more than trying to beat red lights to save a few seconds on your driving time.


For instance, if an accident on the interstate is making you late for work, instead of getting frustrated, call your supervisor and let her know.
You might say, “I wanted to let you know that I am on the way, I’m just running a few minutes late because of an accident.”

, When the kids are making a ruckus in the back seat or your mom is being a backseat driver, it can be very distracting and upsetting. You can relax when you are driving if you ask them not to distract you before you begin driving. If you are already driving, calmly, but firmly tell them to stop.


For instance, you might say, “Kids, when I start driving you have to sit back and talk quietly. This will keep me calm and all of us safe.”
For example, you can say, “Mom, I appreciate your concern, but you telling me how to drive is making me nervous. Please stop.”
If you need to, pull over until the distraction stops. This will keep you calm and safe.

, Although other drivers may do things that upset, frustrate, or even scare you like cutting you off, following too close, swerving, or even showing road rage, stay calm.Allowing rude drivers to upset you will prevent you from relaxing while driving.


Avoid making rude gestures or even eye contact with other motorists. This could escalate the situation unnecessarily.
When possible, change your rate of speed slightly so you can get away from the immediate area of the other driver.
If you feel threatened, roll up your windows and lock your doors. Call 911 if you think the situation may get violent.

Be patient.,
Be defensive, not aggressive when driving around school buses.,
Anticipate stops.,
Keep a safe distance from the back of a school bus.,
Stop and wait while a school bus is loading or unloading.,
Do not pass a school bus while driving, unless there is plenty of room in another lane and you have full visibility.,
Understand that school buses have large blind spots.,
Begin driving again when the flashing lights are turned off and the mechanical stop sign arm is retracted.,
Pay attention to bus driver hand signals.,
Stop before the crosswalk lines at all crosswalks around a school bus stop.,
Recognize that children are unpredictable.",How to Share the Road With School Buses," Try to understand that safety is the most important concern for any school bus driver. Take a deep breath, consider the passengers on the bus and try to avoid anger or frustration that can lead to poor driving.;
, Try to anticipate dangerous situations, stops and other drivers' mistakes when you are driving near or with children. School buses have fewer accidents than standard vehicles, largely in part to the bus drivers' training in defensive driving.

, School buses stop frequently. They usually stop at all marked stop or yield signs and railroad crossings. They also stop to unload and load.

, Keep at least 10 feet (3 m) between you and the school bus at all times, to allow for stops. Watch the bus' brake lights to ensure you start to brake immediately when necessary.

, In all 50 United States, cars on both sides of the road are required to stop and wait during this process. This may not be required if there is a median between the 2 directions of traffic.


If the school bus has red flashing lights and/or an extended stop sign, this means it is loading or unloading children. If it has yellow flashing lights, it indicates that it is slowing down in order to stop. Most school bus related fatalities occur when drivers attempt to pass a school bus illegally. Consider if the consequences of passing a stopped or slow school bus are worth the risk of death.

, Passing on the left is permitted in multiple lane roadways. Ensure there are no warning lights and check all mirrors repeatedly, because putting your own car in danger also endangers children.


Do not pass school buses on the right hand side. This is where all loading and unloading happens. It is illegal in all 50 states to pass on the right hand side of a school bus.

, Although they have big mirrors, they may not be able to see you clearly. Slow down and allow the bus to switch lanes if the bus begins to flash its blinkers.

, Start with a slow speed and maintain your distance. Keep in mind that most school zones have a speed limit of approximately 15 mph (24 km/h).

, Watch for hand motions from the left driver's window. If the driver expects to stop for an extended period of time, there may be hand signals telling you to go around the bus on the left very carefully.

, Driving around school buses means there are usually more pedestrians. Stop signs should be anticipated and heeded, especially when a school bus has loaded or unloaded students.

, They may not understand the safety concerns associated with walking and picking up dropped items near crosswalks and cars. Always look out very carefully before beginning to move through traffic behind a school bus.

Lean your head over to the left and adjust the mirror.,
Lean your head to the right and adjust your side mirror.,
Return to your usual position in the driver’s seat and adjust the center rearview mirror.,
Check the adjustment of your mirrors from a normal, seated driving position.,
Confirm the additional view provided by your side mirrors after proper adjustment.,
Check to ensure objects to the rear transition to the side mirrors as they pass you.",How to Set Rear‐View Mirrors to Eliminate Blind Spots," You should be leaning so that your head almost touches the driver's window. If your mirror is adjusted in the traditional fashion, the side of your car should almost take up the whole mirror. Correct this by adjusting the mirror until you can just see the rear quarterpanel (the rear end of the car).If you’ve adjusted the mirror correctly, the rear of your car should occupy less than a third of the mirror.;
, Your head should be as close to the center as you can without having to leave your seat. From there, position the right side mirror so you can just see the rear quarterpanel of the passenger side in the mirror.Again, ensure the quarterpanel takes up less than a third of the mirror’s view.

, Place this mirror to see as much of your rear window as you can. You want to see directly out of the rear of your vehicle; don’t try tilting the mirror to get a better view of traffic on either side.The center mirror should compensate for what the side mirrors can’t see, not compensate for badly adjusted side mirrors.

, You shouldn’t be able to see your car at all in either side mirror, giving you a much wider view.If you can still see the side of your car in either mirror, try the above steps again. You’ll likely need to adjust the mirrors so they point further outward.

, Your mirrors should now cover more of the lanes right next to your car. Not only can you keep track of cars behind you and to the side, but you can follow them visually as they approach, going a long way to eliminating your car’s blind spots.While you’ll still want to perform a quick shoulder check for added safety when changing lanes, you’ll now have a better view of vehicles and objects to the sides.

, Pay particular attention to cars passing you. As they approach, you should first see them in the center rear view mirror. Then, as they pass you, they’ll move laterally through your center rear view mirror until they appear in the corresponding side mirror. This transition should be smooth; the vehicle should be reflected by your side mirror as soon as it leaves the center mirror. This confirms the elimination of your car’s blind spots.


If there is a pause between the vehicle leaving the center mirror and appearing on your side mirror, you’ll need to re-adjust your mirrors as there’s still a blind spot left.

Come to a complete stop.,
Use hill-start assist, if available.,
Shift into first gear.,
Lift the clutch to its biting point.,
Slowly release the handbrake.,
Slowly release the clutch, listening to the engine.,
Hold the brake pedal, if no handbrake.",How to Prevent a Car from Rolling Back on a Hill1," When you are on a slope, you need to come to a complete stop using either the brake pedal or the handbrake. This holds true whether you’re facing up a slope or down a slope.

Some drivers prefer to use the handbrake, because it frees up their right foot to use on the gas pedal when they intend to start driving again.;
, Many manual cars have hill start assist, which will help keep your car from rolling backward when you are stopped on a hill. It will also help when you try to start from a complete stop as well. If you have hill-start assist in your car, it will automatically work so you do not have to press any buttons.Hill-start sensors in the car automatically detect when your vehicle is on an incline. The hill start assist maintains pressure on the brake pedal for a set period of time to help you while you’re moving your foot from the brakes to the gas pedal.
Hill-start assist does not increase your traction, so if you are in inclement weather or the road is slippery, you may still start to roll backwards.

, When it is time for you to begin moving again, shift into first gear and step on the accelerator pedal.









Continue pressing on the accelerator until the engine spins at about 3000 RPM.

, At this point, you’ll feel the front of the car lift slightly since the clutch is taking on the weight of the car., Gradually release the handbrake as you lift the clutch slightly.As the handbrake disengages and releases, the car should begin to move forward.

, When you hear the sounds of the engine start to fade, continue applying more and more throttle. Now, you’re able to start driving up the hill again without rolling backwards.

Make sure to release the clutch until it is fully engaged.

, If your handbrake doesn't work, use the heel of your right foot to hold down the brake pedal while you use your toes to work the accelerator. You will release the brake pedal instead of the handbrake as you’re releasing the clutch.









If your handbrake doesn’t work, take your car to a mechanic and have it fixed. Relying on the transmission to hold the car causes wear and tear and can have adverse effects on your engine.

Keep your foot on brake.,
Shift into drive.,
Drive forward.",How to Prevent a Car from Rolling Back on a Hill2," If you are waiting for a traffic light to change, continue keeping your foot on the brake to prevent your car from rolling. Holding the brake pedal down will ensure that you’re at a complete stop and prevent you from rolling backwards.If you’re going to be stopped for a while, you can shift into neutral. Keep your foot on the brake pedal the entire time.

, If you have chosen to shift into neutral, you’ll now need to shift into drive to move the car forward. You will start to push down on the accelerator pedal as you smoothly release the brake.









While you are moving your foot from the brake to the accelerator, you will need to move your foot quickly to prevent your car from rolling back. It is normal for the car to move back a few inches, but you need to be cognizant of any cars or people behind you while you’re transitioning.

, Preventing rolling back in an automatic transition is more straightforward than with a manual transmission. Now that you’re ready to start again from your complete stop, you’ll have to make the transition smoothly from the brake to the accelerator. Press down about half way on the accelerator, though you will need to step down less if there are other vehicles in front of you.

Depending on how steep the hill is, you may need to step harder on the accelerator than you would on a flat road.

Parallel park as you normally would.,
Turn the wheels.,
Shift gears, if you have a manual transmission.,
Put car in park, if you have an automatic transmission.,
Apply the emergency brake.,
Use a wheel chock.,
Safely drive away.",How to Prevent a Car from Rolling Back on a Hill3," Your car is more likely to roll while you are parking on a hill than it would on a flat surface.Since parallel parking on a slope can be more difficult than parking on a flat surface, you need to be very comfortable parallel parking and be confident in your skills., After you park on a slope facing uphill, turn the wheels away from the sidewalk or shoulder. This will rotate your tires, so if your gears disengage, or the emergency brake fails, the car will simply hit the curb instead of rolling down the hill.









If you are facing downhill, turn the wheel to the right so the wheels are facing the curb or sidewalk. , For manual transmissions, you will need to shift your car into first gear or reverse once you are in the parking space.Leaving your car in neutral will increase the chances that it will roll backwards or forwards.

, For automatic transmissions, you need to put your car in park after you are in the parking space.









Keep your foot on the brake until you have fully engaged the emergency brake and have shifted gears into park.Leaving the gear in drive can damage your transmission.

, You can do this with both manual and automatic transmissions. The emergency brake is your best assurance that the car won’t roll either forward or backwards when you’re parked on a hill., When you are parking on a steep slope, you can use a wheel chock to stabilize your car and prevent it from rolling backward. A wheel chock is an object, usually a block of wood, that you place behind the back wheel of your vehicle.









You can purchase wheel chocks online, at auto parts stores, or at major realtors. You can also make your own chocks using wood.If you are parked with the front of the car pointing downhill, place the chock under your front tire.

, When you are ready to leave your parking spot and continue your drive, you will need to remove the wheel chock (if you used one) and disengage the emergency brake.When you are pulling out of a parking space while on a hill, you will need to keep your foot on the brake until you are sure that is safe to pull out.

Once you are able to pull out, you can transition your foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator. You will need to make this a smooth transition, otherwise you risk rolling backwards either into the curb or a vehicle parked behind you.
Be sure to check your mirrors before you pull out of your parking space.

, This will help you pull into the spot at the right speed and not overshoot your target. This is particularly useful if you're parking in front of a wall and. It'll help you maintain control of the car.

, Take care to avoid hitting the curb or other cars in your way. Focus on your depth perception: have a firm sense of how close all of the objects in your way really are.

, Once you've pulled into the spot, it's time to firmly press down on the brake so the car comes to a complete stop.

, Keep your foot on the brake as you turn your wheels in the right direction. If you're pulling into a flat spot, just straighten your wheels. If you've parked uphill, you can turn your wheels away from the curb, and if you've parked downhill, you can turn your wheels toward the curb. This will keep your car from rolling away if your brakes are disengaged.

Find a suitable space.,
Ensure it is a safe, legal parking space.,
Turn on your signal and position yourself to back in.,
Consider having someone help.,
Begin backing up.,
Back most of the way in.,
Straighten it out as you finish pulling in.,
Center the vehicle in the space.,
Adjust your vehicle in tight spots.,
Start over whenever necessary.,
Open your door carefully.",How to Parallel Park," Look for a space you can safely get your vehicle into without hitting another vehicle. Once you get better at parallel parking, you may be able to park in tighter spaces, but you may want to start with spaces that have six feet (two meters) of extra space. The space needs to be at least three feet (a meter) longer than your vehicle.








If you've never parallel parked before, consider bringing plastic bins or cones to a parking lot and practice parallel parking between them.;
, Look for signs that indicate parking regulations in the area. Make sure you’re not parking in front of a fire hydrant or another area you cannot block. Note any time limits for the spot.


Make sure nothing is sticking off the end of the either of the vehicles you hope to park between, such as a trailer hitch. If so, ensure you have enough room to fit into the space.
Note the height of the curb next to the space. If it is especially high, you’ll want to take care not to back into it.

, Check your rear view mirror to confirm that no one is immediately behind you. Brake gently to indicate that you are slowing down. Use your turn signal and pull up next to the vehicle in front of the space. About two feet (60 cm) between your vehicle and the parked vehicle is ideal.








If another vehicle comes up behind you while you are trying to park, stay where you are and keep signaling. Roll down your window and hand-signal the other driver to go around you if necessary.
The tighter the space, the closer you'll need to get to the other vehicle when you pull up beside it. For instance, you may need to position your vehicle about a foot (30cm) beside the vehicle in front of your space if the space only has an extra meter or so to work with.

, If the space is tight or you haven’t parallel parked much, it’s worth having someone help guide you into the spot from outside the vehicle. If you have a passenger, ask them to get out and direct you.








Have your passenger show you the distance between your vehicle and the one you’re approaching by holding their hands up to mimic the distance. This will be more accurate than verbal directions.
Consider shifting your side mirror down so you can see the curb. While this isn’t necessary, it may help.

, Shift your vehicle into reverse. Make sure the street behind you is clear of traffic. Look over your shoulder towards the space. Once the back of your seat is even with the back of the vehicle beside you, turn your steering wheel quickly and evenly towards the spot until your vehicle is at a 45 degree angle as it enters the spot.








Conceptually, envision pushing the steering wheel in the direction that you want the back of the car to go.
Avoid swinging the front of your vehicle into the space too early, as you may hit or scrape the vehicle in front of you.

, Continue backing in at an angle until the rear wheel nearest the curb is about a 1 foot (30 cm) from the curb. The rear of your vehicle should still be a few feet from the vehicle behind your parking space.








If your rear tire hits the curb, you've gone too far. Simply shift back into drive, pull forward, and try again.

, Turn the steering wheel back towards the road once the rear of your vehicle is mostly in the space, and still slowly moving backwards. Look to do so when your front bumper is next to the rear bumper of the vehicle in front. This final maneuver moves the vehicle into the space and straightens it out simultaneously.








Another good indicator to begin turning the wheel the other way is when the license plate on the vehicle in front of your space is centered in your windshield.
In tighter spaces, you may need to begin switching the steering wheel’s direction a bit earlier.

, Once you’re successfully in the space, you’ll likely have to re-position your vehicle to get it parallel to the curb and midway between the vehicles in either direction. If you still have space behind you, continue backing up until you’re almost touching the vehicle behind you. Shift into drive and turn slightly towards the curb as you pull forward.







, When the spot is tighter, positioning can be more challenging, and your front end may be further from the curb than you’d like to be. To remedy this, continue pulling forward and backward and wiggling towards the curb. Each time, turn the steering wheel all the way towards the curb before you pull forward, and straighten it up as you back up.Repeat as necessary. The front end will work its way into the space by turning hard to the curb as you pull forward.
If you're too far from the curb in a normal-size spot, pulling out and trying again may be easier.

, If you wind up unable to get into the spot on your first try, don’t worry. Signal and pull back out alongside the vehicle in front of you to start over.

, Before getting out a vehicle, especially on the road side, check to make sure that a vehicle or cyclist is not approaching. It’s important to be aware of bicyclists at all times, and parallel parking spots in particular place cyclists at risk, as you may be opening your door into the cycling lane.


On the curbside, take care not to scratch the door against the curb or other items beside the road.
If the door cannot open all the way while passengers are in the vehicle, remember this when you return to the vehicle. The door may open all the way when the vehicle is empty, but crunch down into the curb once people get into the vehicle and weigh it down.

Get to the DMV early.",How to Not Be Nervous when Taking a Road Test1," Familiarize yourself with all of the information in the books that were given to you and notes that you took while taking any required classes. Read through and memorize rules, road sign symbols, and other information that will be necessary to know during your test.This will take a little of the nervousness away because you’ll be mentally prepared to pass the test.
, Take advantage of having your learner’s permit and drive with someone as much as you can. Think about what they might ask you to do on the test, such as parallel parking, and practice executing those techniques. Have the person riding in the car with you grade you on your driving skills and learn from their constructive criticism., If you schedule your test early in the day instead of in the afternoon or evening, you’ll have less time to obsess about it and overthink everything. Otherwise, your anxiety might build up throughout the day and throw you off., Well beforehand, make sure you have all of the documents together that you’ll need on the day of your road test. This might include your permit, your insurance, and a form of identification. Having these things all in one place and ready to go prevents you from becoming flustered moments before your test while you’re digging through your bag to find a required document., It’s especially important that you’re eating right the day before and the morning of your test. Don’t skip any meals and stay away from excessive amounts of sugar, because sugar might make you jittery or lethargic.

Consider bringing a banana to the DMV for a quick, healthy, energetic snack that’ll help you focus during your test., You might want to load up on coffee before your test, especially if you had trouble sleeping the night before. Unreasonable amounts of caffeine will only make you more agitated and on-edge.

This might lay on the pressure to do well because you’ll feel obligated to tell so many people the outcome., Try inhaling deeply for five seconds and then exhaling slowly. You may be able to relax your body by squeezing your hand into a fist, relaxing your hand, and then imaging your whole body relaxed. These types of exercises can quickly dial back your nerves., Repeat positive statements to yourself over and over, and you might start to believe them. Affirmations will help you to recognize that you have the power to pass the road test.

Consider saying one or more of these positive statements to yourself: “I am relaxed,” “I am prepared,” and “I have the skills that I need to pass my test.”, Your road test may seem extremely important, but it’s really just a small piece of your life. Take a moment to recognize some of the major issues in the world, such as poverty, and tell yourself not to sweat the small stuff.

Remember that three-point turns sometimes require more points.",How to Make a Three Point Turn," It's easiest to learn where the front and back of your car is if you have a friend on hand. They can provide you with a visual cue for you to guesstimate how far the back or front of your car is., Park the car in the driveway or somewhere off the road. You want space for a person to walk around your car without worrying about being hit by another car. Turn the car off.








, Ask her to go to the front. Now, have her move until you think she's at the front bumper. Tell her to mark the space with a piece of tape. Ask her to go to the back. Have her move until you think she's at the back bumper. Have her mark it with a piece of tape.







, Go look, and see how close you were when you had her move. If you were off, get back in the car. Have her stand at the front and back exactly at the bumper, so you get an idea of the length of your car.








, Another way to learn how long your car is to use glassed store fronts when you're trying to parallel park. The next time you try to parallel park, look at your car in the store window. Compare what you see in the window to where you think your car actually ends.

, If you're just learning a 3-point turn, pick an area that's free from traffic. Try an empty parking lot or an abandoned road.

, Look in both directions to make sure you have enough time to make a turn without a car running into you.In addition, pick a point in the road where drivers can clearly see you from a distance. That means you shouldn't make a three-point turn near a curve or a hill, as it can block you from other drivers' view., Usually, a two-way road is enough room to make a three-point turn. In addition, you shouldn't have enough room to make u-turn; if you do, you should use a u-turn, as it is quicker and therefore, safer., Switch on your right turn signal. Look in your mirrors to make sure no one is speeding up behind you. Also, tap your brakes to alert anyone behind you. Once it's safe to do so, pull over to the side of the road. Stop about half a foot from the curb.







, Since you will be going across the road, you need to turn on your left turn signal. Also, check again to make sure no one is coming on the road.You'll need at least 20 seconds to complete your turn, so make sure no one is coming too quickly.







, Move your car like you're making a left turn on to a road. However, instead of continuing on like you normally would, stop about half a foot from the side the road. Right now, you should be facing the side of the road. Your car should be perpendicular to how the road is running.







, Put on your right turn signal. Put the car in reverse, and check for traffic. Make sure you have the space and time to continue with the maneuver. Turn the steering wheel all the way to the right.Maneuver the car backwards slowly. Keep going until your about half a foot from the other side of the road. Your car should now be angled in the direction you are wanting to go.







, Look for traffic again. When it's clear, drive your car onto the correct side of the road, now fully turned around.







, That is, sometimes you need to turn a three-point turn into a multi-point turn. If the road is especially narrow, you may need to back up and move forward more than once, as you run out of room to angle your car. Take as many points as you need, as long as the road is clear. If it's not, try to find a better place to turn around.

Proceed to the highway and prepare to enter the acceleration lane.,
Be cautious when first entering the lane.,
Try to accelerate rapidly enough so that you are virtually very close to interstate speed before you merge with other traffic.,
Look for the merge area, which is after the solid white lane has ended.",How to Merge Onto the Highway," This is a very long lane where you rapidly accelerate to get very close to or match interstate speed.;
, Look out for other drivers also entering the highway. If the lane is crowded you won't be able to go too fast until you hit the interstate.

, Usually open highways have a speed limit of 75 mph (121 km/h) so before merging try to be around at least 65 or 70 mph (105 or 113 km/h). On the other hand, highways near winding mountains are only 55–65 mph (89–105 km/h) so your minimal merge speed should be 45 or 55 mph (72 or 89 km/h) respectively.

, Prepare to do the merge there. You must yield to traffic already on the interstate. Look in your mirrors, over your shoulder and always signal.

"
"
Accelerate to the same speed as highway traffic.,
Put on your turn signal.,
Look for a gap in traffic.,
Merge when it's safe to do so.,
Check other cars' ""body language"".,
Create gaps in front and behind you.,
Never merge abruptly.,
Don't come to a stop in the merge lane.,
Be kind when you see others merging.",How to Merge Onto the Highway Without Crashing," The first step of merging safely is to make sure you're going the same speed as the traffic on the highway. Use the acceleration lane - the entrance ramp or place where you're entering the highway - to quickly gain speed.









Merging at the same speed as the other highway traffic will ensure that you don't create a dangerous situation when you merge, with cars coming up too fast from behind.
Look in your mirrors and pay attention to the other cars while you're accelerating. You may need to wait a beat or two before accelerating to full speed if you see a line of cars coming up quickly in the lane into which you're trying to merge.;
, Do it early, so other drivers know what you intend to do. This gives them time to make any necessary adjustments. However, keep in mind that as the person merging, you don't have the right of way. Other drivers are not expected to move out of the way; rather, they'll keep going at the same speed, and it's up to you to make sure you adjust your speed and merge safely.








, If traffic on the highway is heavy, you'll have to find a gap before you merge. Keep your eyes on the road, but check your mirrors and look behind you to figure out when it's safe to go. At the same time, maintain an appropriate speed to allow you to merge safely into the flow of traffic.









Look in the internal rearview mirror, then at your driver's side mirror.
Glance to see that there is no car in your blind spot (close behind you in the lane that you are merging).
Check whether someone has slowed or stopped in the ramp/merge lane in front of you.

, When you see a gap, ease your car into the lane. You should now be driving at the same speed as the rest of the traffic. Pay attention to the cars around you as you merge; you'll need to be able to react quickly if someone brakes in front of you or tries to enter your lane.








, Technically, cars in the merging lane are supposed to continue at the same speed, making it the responsibility of the person merging to find a gap and ease into it. However, every driver behaves a little differently, so it's important to pay attention to what's going on and make decisions based on reality.









If you see a car behind you that seems to be slowing down, the driver is probably trying to ""let you in""; accelerate and take the person up on the favor. The same goes if you notice cars moving out of the merge lane to make room for you.
If you see a car that seems to be speeding up, let the person pass before trying to merge.
Sometimes drivers will wave you in with their hands, too.
Never assume others will use the correct speed. It's up to you to react to what happens.

, As you merge, you want to maintain a nice distance from the cars behind you and in front of you. This provides a little buffer in case the car in front of you brakes, forcing you to suddenly slow down. Practice accelerating at just the right speed, so that you're not coming up on cars too quickly or slowing things down behind you.








, Do your best not to jut into the lane into which you're trying to merge. Other drivers might not see you. Make sure you use your turn signal, and make eye contact if possible.








, If traffic is bad and you don't see any gaps, you might be tempted to come to a stop. This is not a good idea, because it takes too long for a car to accelerate from 0 to 65; when you try to start moving again, it'll be dangerous for both you and the other drivers. By putting your turn signal on right away, accelerating to the speed of traffic, and making eye contact with the driver behind you, you should be able to create a gap.







, Ease off the gas a bit if someone's trying to merge onto the highway in front of you, or speed up if that's the safer option. Stay alert and try to make things easier for the other drivers - it makes the highway safer for everyone.

Complete the turn while looking toward the left and center.",How to Make a Left Turn1," If your turn indicator is broken, you will need to signal the left turn with your arm. The following are arm signals for left turns:


If you drive on the right side of the road, use your left arm in a straight position to indicate a left turn.
If you drive on the left side of the road, extend your right arm out of the window horizontally. Point it down at an angle toward the ground. Your thumb should be pointing toward the ground.;
, If there are several lanes, remember that most turns require you to be in the closest lane to the side of the turn. For example, if you want to turn left, you should be in the left-most lane.


Some roads have multiple turning lanes. Ensure you are in the right lane by reading signs on the road and posted nearby.

, Stop just before the white line, with your wheel straight. Then, when the light changes or there is no traffic from either side, begin turning your wheel to the left to execute the turn.


If you turn your wheel prematurely and a car hits you from behind, you can be pushed into oncoming traffic., Traffic going straight almost always has the right of way, even if you aren’t required to stop before turning.

, If you check your right side first, you may find your wheel turning slightly toward the right. , Then, press on the gas when you are halfway through the turn, to ensure you have control of the speed of the car.

, Avoid turning out to the right first, since the angle of your turn may be too wide and place you into oncoming traffic.

, Your turn signal usually turns off automatically. However, for gently left hand turns you may need to click it upward to turn it off.

For the safety of drivers and bicyclists around you, you should never begin your turn without signalling.

, In some states, you cannot turn on red if there is a red right arrow, so check your state laws.Many cities also have laws in addition to, or separate from, state laws. Make sure you know all the laws in your city.

, If there is a crosswalk, stop at the crosswalk. Otherwise, stop at the limit line.


You must stop completely before making your turn. Do not coast through the turn, even if all appears to be clear. , Pedestrians crossing always have the right of way. Cyclists may also be coming behind you. If there is a bike lane, you must signal and enter it just as you would a regular lane.

Take small steps.,
Drive away from others.,
Go out with a friend or family member.",How to Get Over the Fear of Driving1," If you are too nervous to drive across town, make a shorter trip -- even if it is just around the block. Do not get yourself so worked up that driving becomes a bigger deal than it is. Unless you are overwhelmed with anxiety and terrified to get into a car, make yourself drive. Remember, even taking a small step still counts as practice.Push your comfort zone a little at a time. For example, you may want to start by sitting in a parked car, getting used to all the controls, before you ever put the key in the ignition. Once you are comfortable doing that, you may want to start the car, shift the car into drive, and then back into park. Slowly build on your comfort level.Figure out if your fear of driving is generalized or specific to one aspect of driving. If it is the latter, practice mastering the feared skill. For example, you may be terrified to parallel park. You may wish to find an empty street where you can practice maneuvering between safety cones, and when you have mastered that, perhaps you can try parking between two friends’ cars.;
, Get used to driving in quiet areas before practicing in traffic. Find quiet side streets or an empty parking lot, and get used to starting, stopping, signaling, turning, reversing, and so on. Learn to control your vehicle and to find the controls someplace where you don't have to worry about traffic or other drivers.


Work up to busier roads and longer drives as you start to feel comfortable operating the car.
You may wish to practice driving only during the day at first. You will feel more confident simply because you are able to see better., Driving with someone you trust may help you to feel at ease in the car. If anything bad should happen, this person will be there to assist and advise you, and even to take over if traffic or conditions gets to be too much for your experience or confidence level.


Make sure you are driving with a person who is naturally calming to you. For example, you probably want a person who will calmly tell you, “Oops, looks like we missed the turn back there. How about you pull into this parking lot and turn around?” instead of shouting, “That’s where we needed to turn!”
Let your friend or family member know how they can be supportive to you in the car. Maybe you would like them to tell you about their day to help keep your mind calm. Or maybe you would prefer quiet to concentrate.

Read your owner's manual.,
Teach yourself basic car maintenance.,
Review the rules of the road.,
Take a defensive driving class.",How to Get Over the Fear of Driving2," By learning more about your car, you can find out how it works, learn about its safety features, and learn how to troubleshoot problems. A better understanding of a car makes you feel comfortable with it. Learn about the parts of your car, and then experiment with your driving, away from other cars, to see how they work.


For example, if your car has anti-lock brakes (ABS), try them out in a safe place, before you need to use them. Get up to a medium speed, and press the brake hard. You may feel the pedal pulse, or hear a pulsing noise. That's exactly what it's supposed to do. Anti-lock brakes are designed to stop your car in the shortest possible distance, by automatically pulsing the brakes to prevent you from skidding.
Get used to your own car. It may be better for you to practice driving in the same vehicle until you get more confident. All cars are a little different and have their own quirks.

, Learn how to fill up washer fluid, replace fuses, put air in your tires, or replace windshield wipers. Getting comfortable with the parts of your car, even if they are very basic, can help you feel more confident and less anxious.


Learn how to change a tire. A lot of people are afraid of what they will do in the event of a flat tire. If you can change a tire, you will not need to wait at the side of the road for help. You can feel empowered to solve your problem.

, Consult the highway code or book an appointment with a qualified driving instructor. Feeling knowledgeable about rules and expectations can help your confidence.


Watch safe driving videos online. If you can’t get to a class, try watching videos to build skills and increase your confidence level.

, Learn to identify and correct or avoid difficult situations, before they become emergencies. Your anxiety level may be reduced by feeling more prepared to handle problematic scenarios.Not only will you learn valuable, confidence-boosting driving skills, but you can often get a discount on your insurance premiums for completing a reputable defensive driving training course."

Be prepared for your drive.,
Practice safe driving.,
Practice visualization techniques.Visualization tricks your brain into feeling like you were actually there.,
Utilize deep breathing techniques.,
Listen to music to help you calm down.,
Talk or sing to yourself.,
Consider more help.",How to Get Over the Fear of Driving3," To lessen your anxiety, it might help you to have everything ready for your journey. Figure out what items or steps you could take that would make you feel better, and then plan ahead.For example, you might wish to:


Fill up the car with gas.
Check the tire pressure.
Have a first aid kit in the trunk.
Have phone numbers of people to call in case of an emergency.
Have directions printed out or ready to go in your phone before you leave.

, Don’t engage in risky behavior, like speeding or looking at your phone while driving, that could increase your anxiety level. It also increases your risk of an accident.


Do not feel like you need to drive more aggressively than you are comfortable with. For example, a lot of people accelerate through yellow lights, but you might want to drive more cautiously until you feel less anxious and more confident.
Do not talk on the phone while driving, and never text and drive. Your phone can wait until you arrive.

, It helps you feel calmer and more confident, because you are now able to draw on the “experience” you already have.Before you start driving, close your eyes and breathe deeply. Try imagining yourself going through all the steps of starting the car: buckling your seat belt, turning on the engine, getting out of your parking place, and successfully driving to your destination with confidence and calmness.
Visualize the route and passing landmarks on your route if you can.

, Focusing on your breathing can help you remain present and calm. Once you get good at mindful breathing, you will find it to be a relaxation tool you can utilize anywhere!An easy technique to try while you are driving is simply breathing in through your nose, feeling your belly and lungs expand as air fills your body, and then fully exhale out your nose.

, Relaxing music at low volume can help you calm down. Do not listen to anything that will further agitate you., Lift your spirits with positive or silly words and fun songs. Maybe you only want to do this when you are alone so you don’t feel self-conscious.


For example, you could repeat a mantra, like “I’m doing a great job. I’m confident and calm. I will get to my destination on time and safely.”
Make yourself laugh. Be silly with your speeches -- no one is going to hear you! For example, you could narrate your drive like you’re in a race car: “She’s coming round the corner… will the Accord let her merge? YES! She’s moved into first place, ladies and gentlemen!” Laughter will help you relax.Singing your favorite, guilty-pleasure songs at the top of your lungs can help you enjoy yourself. Not only is it fun, but singing helps you focus on your breathing and remain present, which helps relieve stress., If you have tried some relaxation techniques and are still feeling anxious behind the wheel, you may wish to seek counseling from a counselor who specializes in phobias. Fortunately, with professional help, phobias generally require fairly straightforward treatment.


You will most likely work with a professional using exposure therapy techniques; that is, getting a little more comfortable with one aspect of driving at a time, slowly building your tolerance level.You may also wish to learn more about Overcoming a Driving Phobia.

Decide if the disabled person will be driving or requiring a surrogate driver. If you need a rental car without wheelchair access or a swivel seat and there is a surrogate driver, the rental car company is likely to rent you a regular car and waive any driver fees by special arrangement.
Determine if you need wheelchair access. People with wheelchairs may need a transfer board and an easy access bus. Vans and mini-buses are generally the only vehicles that come with wheelchair access, and there is very limited availability at major rental car companies.
If the handicapped person is trained in driving with hand controls, rental car companies usually carry a limited number of vehicles that use left or right hand controls. You should also ask about a panoramic mirror for easier views and a spinner knob that helps the driver to control the wheel with a single knob.
Determine if any handicapped drivers or passengers need a swivel seat to get in and out of the vehicle. These are often removable and available by request.;
, Most airport websites have a list of the car rental companies that are available to its patrons.

, You will need to call the company directly, instead of using travel aggregate sites like Expedia, Travelocity or Hotwire.


In busy airports and during vacation or high-season travel times you should call 1 to 3 months in advance to reserve your handicapped rental car or van.

,


You do not need to explain all the details of the person's disability, merely what you will need in order to rent from the company.

, Most rental car agencies will require you to bring the driver's license as proof of age and the ability to drive.


A disabled person who is over the age of 25 can rent a car with a surrogate driver without a driver's license. The surrogate driver will need to be over the age of 25 with a valid driver's license.
Ask if your car or van may has a handicapped accessible license plate. If not, you may need to bring your dashboard disability sticker.

,, Before you book, it is important to ensure they will be able to transport you to and from the rental car location in a handicapped accessible shuttle or van.

, If not, you can call a wheelchair accessible van rental agency.


Accessible Vans of America, Wheelchair Getaways, Wheelchair Vans and Wheelers rent handicapped accessible vans exclusively from their websites. Specify your location and travel dates to see what availability they have.

, You should be clear about what services will be provided, such as a shuttle, before you place the reservations.

, Few rental car companies will charge you in advance; however, they will require a credit card in case of a late cancellation.

A pink badge indicates that the instructor is not fully qualified and is only a trainee, known as a ""Potential Driving Instructor"" (PDI). A green badge indicates that the instructor is fully qualified, known as an ""Approved Driving Instructor"" (ADI). For the best results, go with an instructor that has a green badge.;
, The majority of independent driving instructors will have their own website; from this you can gather information and most possibly testimonials from previous learners who have passed their test commenting on what their instructor was like.


Alternatively, speak to any friends that have already passed their driving test and ask them about their driving instructor.

, Driving lessons don't come cheap, and if they do, then they're more than likely not worth it. Most lessons are paid by the hour and the price is different throughout the United Kingdom.

, You want to make sure the car you are learning to drive in is a fairly new car with all components working correctly. Whilst doing your lessons and your test in an older car is not much of problem, the ride given may cause you to fail your test.


Make sure the instructor has a dual-control car (this is an extra set of pedals in the passenger foot-well for the instructor to use if necessary).

, Whilst you may think it's a fast, easy and cheap way to learn to drive, you should not block-book lessons straight away. Before doing so, just book single 1 hour lessons every couple of days or once a week with the instructor to until you are comfortable with the instructor and your driving capability.


You need to make sure that the instructor arrives on time and that he gives you the amount of tuition you have paid for. Most of all, you need to make sure you have a good relationship with your instructor.

Study the layout of the switches.,
Drive your car until you reach your desired speed and hit “SET.” Cruise control will set the car to hold steady at a particular speed.,
Stop cruise control whenever you need to.,
Resume cruise control, if you want.,
Change the cruise control speed when necessary.,
Reserve cruise control for the open road.,
Avoid using cruise control in hazardous conditions.,
Stay focused on the road.,
Use cruise control to maximize fuel economy and ensure you maintain a safe speed.",How to Use Cruise Control on a Car," Usually, these are found either on the steering column (the part connecting the steering wheel to the dashboard area), or on the steering wheel itself. Controls found on the steering wheel usually consist of a few buttons. If car’s controls are located on the steering column, look for a lever that sticks out, often near a windshield wiper lever.








Check your car’s operating manual if you are unable to find the cruise control switches.;
, Each car model’s controls look slightly different. Generally, however, the controls are labeled clearly. You should see one or two buttons to turn cruise control ""ON"" and ""OFF,"" another labeled “SET,” and one labeled “RES” (meaning “resume”). Your car may also have a switch labeled “CANCEL.” Familiarize yourself with the location of these buttons.








Many cars have additional buttons to increase or decrease speed (marked by a +/-) when using cruise control.

, Once you reach the speed you want (keep an eye on your car’s speedometer), push the “SET” button. You can now take your foot off of the gas pedal, and your car will maintain the speed for you.








For some car models, cruise control will not operate below a certain speed, such as 40 miles (64 km) per hour.

, If you need to slow down, stop, turn, or make another change in your driving, it’s time to turn cruise control off, or at least pause it. This is easy to do, but there are a few different methods:








To stop cruise control briefly (such as when a car in front of you brakes), just press the brake as you normally would.
If you are driving a manual, you can also disengage cruise control by pressing the clutch.
If you are completely done using cruise control, you can press the “OFF” or ""ON/OFF"" switch.
If your car has a cruise control “CANCEL” switch, you can also press that to stop it.

, Sometimes you only need to turn cruise control off momentarily, such as while braking for a car ahead of you. When you’re ready to get back into cruise control, just get back up to (or near) your desired speed and hit the “RES” button. This will put your car back into cruise control, at the speed you set previously.







, For instance, perhaps you have been driving using cruise control on a road where the speed limit is 55 miles (89 km) per hour, and then you enter a zone where the speed limit increases to 70 miles (110 km) per hour. Just press the gas pedal to bring your car up to the new speed, and hit the “SET” button again. This will set cruise control at the new speed.

If your car has a +/- button for cruise control, press this when you want to raise or lower your car's speed.

, Cruise control is really meant to be used in situations where you can drive mostly without needing to stop or slow down. It’s ideal for driving on freeways and highways. Using cruise control while driving on busy city streets doesn’t make any sense, because of all the stopping and starting you will have to do.Using cruise control on busy streets can also be dangerous. Since you yourself are not in complete control of your car, you may be paying less attention. You might brake or react to other cars more slowly than normal, increasing the chance of an accident.

, Cruise control can slightly slow your reaction time and keeps you from having total control over acceleration. This means it’s best not to use it in situations where road conditions require more careful and nuanced driving. These include:Wet or snowy roads
Hilly, steep, or mountainous areas
Winding roads

, Cruise control is not auto-pilot. You will still need to stay focused on the road. Scan the road constantly for any upcoming hazards or other vehicles. Keep your feet near the brake pedal at all times (not folded under you on the seat or propped up on the dash) in case you need to slow or stop quickly. Most of all, keep your mind on driving: don’t zone out!, Your car's engine runs more efficiently in conditions where cruise control is engaged safely. Since you can set it at a specific speed, it’s also a way to avoid getting a speeding ticket if you have a lead foot. Just set it at or below the speed limit! Finally, cruise control lets you relax a little as you drive, which can reduce fatigue on long trips."

Use synthetic oil in your car to save on fuel consumption.,
Use stock tires.",How to Save Gas," This is the single most effective and easiest solution to increasing gas efficiency. The most fuel-efficient speed may be the point at which your vehicle shifts to high gear. For most vehicles, this is somewhere around 50 mph (80 km/h).In fact, every 5 mph (8.0 km/h) you go over 50, you can assume you're spending an extra $.25 a gallon on gas.Your efficiency decreases significantly the faster you go.
What's more, lights are often timed to the speed limit. If you go faster than necessary, you're just stopping and starting anyway – which is also bad for saving gas.;
, You can avoid wasting fuel by not tailgating. In these instances, you'll often be pressing the gas to regain the speed lost from braking which forces you to correct your following distance by applying your brakes, causing a vicious cycle. This constant up and down uses up more fuel than just driving steadily and at a safe distance.


Repeated braking simply wastes energy, converting it into unnecessary heat energy and greatly reduces the service life of your brakes. In the future most cars may be equipped with systems in which braking power will be converted into reusable energy, but it is highly unlikely that your car has this technology now unless it is a hybrid.

, Every time you punch the gas to quickly accelerate after stopping you are burning extra fuel and increasing tire wear. By accelerating more slowly you are only using the fuel required to get the vehicle to the cruising speed.


In short, you want to use the gas and brake pedals as little as possible. Keeping that in mind while driving will keep your gas usage to a minimum.

, Fuel consumption increases when you allow the vehicle speed to drift lower and then compensate by accelerating back up. Maintaining a steady position on the accelerator keeps the gas flowing minimally. Allowing the car to lose speed going up hills and gain speed going down increases efficiency.


And as for weaving, don't do it. It's for much the same reason – when you weave in and out of lanes, you're constantly speeding up and slowing down. Relax and stick to one lane., If your route will allow it, try to make as few left turns as possible on the way to your destination (or right turns in countries with left-hand traffic). Stopping and waiting at an intersection to make a turn across the oncoming lane lets the engine run idle, which wastes gas, as does accelerating once again to make the turn., Another way to keep your foot off the brakes and the gas pedal is to use overdrive and cruise control on the highway. Overdrive keeps your engine's speed down, extending the life of your engine, too.Cruise control keeps your car going at a steady rate, allowing the gas a break from pumping too hard or not pumping enough. However, it's only useful in stretches – don't bother using it in town, you'll be stopping and starting too much for it to make any difference.

, Higher gears at low speed and vice versa will lead to lose of more fuel. Shift gears carefully and according to the desired speed. This will cause less strain on your engine.

, This part is just science: a lighter car uses less gas. What can make your car lighter? Not having a full tank. So when you hit that 1/3 of a tank and are tempted to fill up, give it a couple days. That last 1/3 of a tank may last you a bit longer than the first third did.


That being said, it's generally true that gas prices spike up on the weekends, starting on Thursday afternoons. So if you think you'll need gas on Saturday, it might be wise to fill up now. Scope out any especially good gas prices to see if it's worth buying now., If you idle your car for more than a minute, it will save gas to turn off the engine. Also, new cars do not need to be ""warmed up"" on a cold winter day – a couple of seconds should do the trick.


Whenever you're waiting for someone, turn off the idle. Drive thru or going inside? Going inside. You can still play the radio without idling!

, When you turn the hose off, there's still all that gas in the line. To get that last 1/2 cup of gas (that's 4 ounces of free gas!), turn the nozzle upside-down and give it a shake before you take it out of your tank.


Lift up the hose a bit to get the gas resting in the line. Gravity causes the gas to lie at the lowest point, so lifting it up gets it out of there and into your tank.

, The better cooling method at freeway speeds depends on your car. Rolling down the windows creates drag, and using the air conditioning causes your engine to work harder. However, rolling down the windows is okay in city traffic., More science! The cooler your car is, the less gas will evaporate from your tank.That's like giving money to the sky.


And did we mention that your bum doesn't get seared on contact? It's better for your car and for you. It's hard to drive when you can't touch the steering wheel without burning yourself!

, Fuel economy is worse in busy, high-traffic times or when it is raining, windy or when barometric pressure is high. Rain, headwind and high barometric pressure create extra air drag that uses more fuel to create and maintain forward motion.


However, a tailwind (a wind behind you) helps. Which direction is the wind coming from?
It should come as no surprise that high-traffic times are not good for fuel efficiency. You're stopping and starting, idling, weaving, and probably taking part in just about every bad habit for your fuel economy.

, Sure, when we cut the engine, everything goes off, but what about when we start it back up? If you turn everything off, the next time you start up your car, it'll take way less gas to get everything going.You can then turn everything on one at a time, which is much easier for your car to handle.

, Try to consolidate errands and appointments. Get all your errands done in one go to increase your free time, too. You can also plan your trip on certain days to avoid traffic and paying higher gas prices the next week.


For example, buy non-perishable necessities (including pet food, toilet needs, dry goods, and canned groceries, etc.) in bulk so you don't have to make a special trip for a few items.

, Get rid of any unnecessary weight in your car or truck, such as golf clubs or unnecessary tools and materials. Lowering the tailgate on a pickup truck actually reduces your gas mileage by reducing drag, too. If the tailgate isn't lowered, an air cushion is created behind the cab that creates a low drag surface for the air to travel over.


But if you have to carry something, carry it in your trunk, not on the rack on top of your car. With something on top of your car, there is way more drag, slowing your car down, making it more difficult to accelerate.

, A dirty air filter will rob the engine of power and efficiency. It will use more gas than a clean filter. So if it's been a while, get it changed. It should only take a few minutes – in fact, you may be able to do it yourself.


In the scheme of car parts to replace, air filters are pretty cheap. Most are about $30-40.

, Properly inflated tires will increase your traveling distance on a tank of gas. Keep a tire gauge handy and check the pressure. Tires naturally lose air over time, so don't be alarmed if one or more is low.


Check your tire pressure more often when the outside temperature changes greatly. Hot tires will have high pressure from expanding air – but if air is let out to the proper amount of pressure, then when cooled they will become too low in the cooler conditions, so you'll need to reinflate them when cooler. Under inflated and greatly over-sized tires have more rolling resistance and this will reduce your miles per gallon (MPG) and cause tire wear from the excessive friction.
If you do need new tires, get radial ones. They have a low rolling resistance, keeping your car aerodynamic.

, It's a good idea for your fuel economy to change spark plugs and wires on schedule, and the coil(s) when their effectiveness is breaking down (such as shorting internally). The better your engine runs, the more power it will produce using less fuel.

, As a bonus, fewer oil changes are needed saving your time and reducing trips to the mechanic as well as less used oil for the environment.


When you're getting your tune up, ask your mechanic about what oil you should be using for your car and for saving gas. He may be able to throw in a bottle or two with your tune-up.

, Before changing your tires to the modern style thick ones, think again. The more the width, the higher the rolling resistance offered and higher the fuel consumption.

, If your children go to the same school as the children next door, it is a good idea to take turns driving. The best way to improve your car’s efficiency is by not using it so much.

, Heat causes fuel to evaporate. Parking in a shady spot has the added benefit of keeping the car cooling, lessening the necessity of air conditioner.

, Weight is one of the biggest causes for loss of a car's kinetic energy. Get the lightest car that will serve your needs. Take the extra weight from your car. An extra weight of 100 pounds (45.35 kg) increases fuel consumption by 1-2%.

, The faster you drive, the harder the engine has to work to push through the wind. Speeding can reduce fuel efficiency by up to 33%. Always maintain the economy speed.

, Using cruise control reduces fuel consumption by maintaining the constant speed.

, Try not to accelerate or de-accelerate too quickly. This is often linked to poor gear shifting where you are either shifting the gears too often or not enough, it overworks the engine, &, in turns, wastes fuel.

, Do a manual transmission shift to higher gear, as soon as you reach your desired speed, by skipping intermediate gears.

, Brakes waste energy of the fuel (which is already burnt), & accelerating after braking consumes more fuel than driving at a constant speed.

, We can reduce the fuel efficiency up to 3% by maintaining the proper inflation of tires. It is recommended to check the tire pressure at least monthly; more preferably, weekly.

, A properly tuned engine maximizes power & can enhance fuel efficiency.

, The air filter should be cleaned; a dirty filter will reduce fuel economy or may make the engine stall when idling. Replace it as per the manufacturer's instructions.

, Idling a vehicle consumes a significant amount of fuel. The best way to warm up the engine is to drive it slowly until it reaches the proper operating temperature.

, Avoid using air conditioner in stop & go city driving. Studies show that, at highway speeds, cars get somewhat better mileage with using air conditioner.

, Drive the car by rolling up the windows. The drag caused by rolled down windows at high speed reduces fuel efficiency.

, Some cars get better mileage at specific speed (sweet speed). Find your car’s sweet speed & pick your roads accordingly.

, Fuel can be saved by using synthetic oil. Oil having less viscosity would cause a car to work less hard. The lightest oil can also be used as substitute.

, Use the proper idea to maintain the driving as per the traffic signals. Stop & go driving is wasteful.

, Narrow tire has less of a frontal area, & thus can reduce aerodynamic drag in additional with there is reduction of contact surface resulting in low frictional resistance.

, Using the clutch in running condition results in wasting the energy that already produced due to the burning of fuel. Except during changing, the gear clutch is not to be used.

, Switch off the engine if you're stopping for more than 2 minutes; it helps to reduce useless burning of fuel.

, Change the fuel filter as per the manufacturer's instructions.

, Check its condition regularly.

, Have a block heater, and save fuel by using a heater to raise the engine temperature instead of idling."

Make opportunistic plans for your route.",How to Predict Traffic Signals," A 45 mph (72 km/h) speed limit is often a net speed of 30 mph (48 km/h), sometimes a lot less, in an area with traffic signals. The fact that you're moving along at 30 mph (48 km/h) in a 45 mph (72 km/h) zone should make no difference to your travel time, especially if you are almost never stopping.;
, On sections of road where this is true, once you are moving with the flow of traffic, maintaining a given speed will usually get you through without stopping.

, This is the opposite of what most people think, but absolutely works. A green light can be totally unpredictable. It might stay green right up until you're almost committed and then turn yellow. Green will betray you. A green light will tempt you to speed toward it and force you to slam on your brakes. When you are approaching a signal that is red, you are covering ground instead of idling at the signal. Well coordinated signals will typically be red as you approach then turn green shortly before or after you arrive at the intersection.

, You know you'll stop at a red light, which makes it predictable, but it might just turn green, so if you slow down enough approaching it, you might never stop. At the very least, you won't have worn brakes and burned fuel keeping the car moving fast. Now it's only a matter of trying to work out how long it will remain red, and how long it will be green after that, and moderate your speed to be moving at the right rate when you reach the intersection to follow the other cars through without stopping at all (though not so fast that you can't stop if they stall, the signal doesn't behave like you wanted it to, or whatever other unpredictable things happen). You may also be able to tell from where you are that even though the light will turn green about when you get there behind the traffic, that you won't be making it through, and plan accordingly.

, This takes 'fuzzy' experience, because it's different for most intersections and is different for different cars.

, You can often tell fairly precisely what the next light will do after the current one changes.

, If it's green or only just started flashing red, your green light is still 'fresh', and you might make it.

, If you see these things, your green light will in all probability betray you.

, If you have a green light, and the turn signal facing you just turned green, and there are still cars turning, your green light may be 'fresh' enough to make.

, More often than not, you can't.

, Each signal will likely be phased for a particular day and time, so pay attention to learn what each signal does on your commute.

, Many parking lots have multiple entrances on different sides. With a lot on the left, if your traffic light has turned red, or is going to turn red, consider taking the a left turn instead of proceeding to a later entrance. If it's fresh and green, maybe proceed ahead to an uncontrolled left turn lane (depending on traffic) to avoid waiting for the signal to cycle all the way through to a left turn. Similar when approaching a lot on the right, especially if you are in a 'right on red' jurisdiction. Mind the pedestrians, though.

, Most American cities are laid out like a grid. There are multiple paths/doglegs to take to reach the same destination, on or off freeways. Often some of these paths have fewer signals, or more 'friendly' signals. Balance this with the knowledge that every turn is usually a stop. At certain times of the day or week, an otherwise 'impassible' industrial zone with relatively few signals can be absolutely deserted.

Take toll roads or toll lanes if you're willing to pay.

",How to Shorten Your Commute," For a more accurate time, try recording your commute several times and averaging the times out.;
, Identify spots on the road that slows and sections of the freeway that are much faster: Lane merges, interchanges, exits, lane openings, and turns.

, Alternate freeways, side streets, alleys, highways, and long-cuts (detours that are longer in distance, but shorten the time it takes to get to your destination). Make sure you do this during daylight; you could get lost (Here's where the compass and cell phone kicks in if you happen to have a friend who knows the area more).

, Compare with your old commute way.

, The more your times are further from rush hour, the more minutes you can shave off your commute. Also identify the days that traffic is the worst and suggest telecommuting.

, You might as well use the time and gas you spend in traffic on something productive. And leaving later for home also makes the drive shorter.

, Having someone in the car gives you the alternative to use the carpool lane if it is faster than the rest of the freeway.

Arrive early.",How to Find a Parking Spot2," When you get to the parking lot at your destination, choose a parking row. Instead of driving around the lot looking for a spot, simply choose one row and wait for a spot to open up. You will save the time involved in the more active parking lot search, which doesn’t typically save any time., If the parking lot is full because of a major event, you should just sit around in your car and wait for a spot to open up. Although it may sound more time intensive than driving around or going to a different parking lot, it will typically save you time and energy.Wait in a strategic location. Stop in the middle of a row of parking spots that is regularly changing, and you'll be the first if a spot becomes available.
Look for people who are walking back to their car. If they have car keys, keep a close eye on them until they get to their spot. When they leave, take their spot.

, Parking spots directly in front of an entranceway are often the most coveted. To save time, look for a spot a few parking rows over or even on the edges of the parking lot., Try to avoid pedestrian crossings and pick up lanes. Look for spots that are close to an exit, so that you can increase your efficiency when you need to leave the parking lot.If you are parking in a shopping center, you may want to park close to the shopping cart return center. This will save you time when you are leaving.

, There are a variety of websites that specialized in searching for parking spots, such as parking spotter. You can also try general websites, such as Craigslist. Navigate to one of these websites and click on relevant links to find long term parking options for your neighborhood.

, If you have trouble finding parking at a particular destination, you may want to arrive earlier to your destination. Whether you are going to work or to an entertainment destination, getting to your destination early will increase your chances of finding a spot."

P is for park. This gear is designed specifically for parking a vehicle.
R is for reverse, used for backing up a vehicle.
N is for neutral. This is used when you do not need to change the speed of the car, or for coasting. Keep in mind: Coasting is illegal in many U.S. states, and should be avoided.

D is for drive, the option used for moving the vehicle forward. Operating a CVT is almost the same as automatic, except that with a CVT, you will never feel the vehicle shift - it is only one gear.

Make sure to look toward the ground on either side of your vehicle using your head and mirrors to ensure there are no people or animals laying in your path.;
, When driving forward or in reverse, your right foot should be the only one on the gas or brake pedal. If your car is equipped with a standard transmission, your left foot manages the clutch, but in vehicle’s with automatic transmissions, the left foot simply goes unused. Press your right foot on the brake pedal firmly, so that the vehicle won’t move once it is in reverse.The brake pedal is in the middle on vehicle’s equipped with a standard transmission and is the furthest to the left in automatic vehicles.
The brake pedal is the widest pedal.

, While it may be customary to drive with your hands at ten and two o’clock on the steering wheel, backing up will require that you turn your body to the right. Place your left hand at the top of the wheel so you can easily make small adjustments to keep the vehicle moving straight as you back up.It may be difficult to reach the steering wheel with your right hand while backing up, so steering with one hand is optimal.

, Depending on the transmission your vehicle came equipped with, there are a few ways you may need to shift into reverse. On automatic vehicles, it usually requires pressing a button on the shift lever and pulling it backward until it is aligned with the letter “R.” In standard vehicles equipped with a five speed transmission, you can usually shift into reverse by pressing the shift lever all the way to the left and pulling it backward.In vehicles equipped with six speed standard transmissions, reverse is usually all the way to the left and up, next to first gear.
Some cars require that you press down on the shift lever or press a release to access the reverse gear.
If you are unsure of how to shift into reverse, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual.

, Provided your view is not obstructed, twist your body to the passenger side so you can look out the back window of your vehicle over your right or passenger side shoulder. Make sure you do not remove your foot from the brake pedal. If you are driving a box truck or other vehicle that blocks your view out the back window, you will have to rely on your side mirrors to guide you.You may choose to place your right hand on the top of the passenger seat to help you comfortably look out the back.
If you are relying on your mirrors, make sure to check each of them frequently.

, As you take the pressure off of the brake pedal with your right foot, the vehicle will begin to move backward. Most vehicle’s engines idle at a high enough RPM (revolutions per minute) to propel the vehicle without any need to apply the gas.Ease off the brake slowly to ensure you do not accelerate too quickly to easily manage.
Press back down on the brake pedal to slow your vehicle down while backing up.
If your vehicle is equipped with a standard transmission, you will need to use the gas as you ease off the clutch, but can then allow the vehicle to idle.

,, Neutral is the middle position in which you can move the shifting lever freely around.

,, First gear is usually the leftmost gear on the top.

,,, This will get you moving. The basics of putting the car into gear with a manual transmission is this: letting off on the clutch while you depress the accelerator. You need to master this movement in order get the car moving.


This technique will take a while to master. In the beginning, you'll let the clutch off too early, causing the car to stall, or you won't let the clutch off early enough, causing the engine to rev and the car to shoot forward when you let the foot off the clutch.

, Put your right foot on the brake, press your left foot down on the clutch, and start the engine. Try not to get flustered when you stall.


If you stall while on a busy stretch of road, put on your emergency flashers as you start your car up again. This will let other drivers behind you know that they can pass if you are safe, or wait for you get the car up and running again.

, The basics of shifting into a different gear are pretty easy, but they need to followed accurately each time in order to work.
Take your foot off the accelerator. Your foot needs to be off the accelerator before you shift into another gear.






Depress the clutch. This disengages the spinning engine from the spinning wheels, allowing you lock into the teeth of a different gear.






Move your shifting lever into gear while clutch is still depressed. Usually, you move from one gear to the next, or back down.






Release the clutch. You can rest your left foot again once you've shifted gears.







, Once it does, take your foot off the accelerator, depress the clutch, and bring the shift lever into second gear with your foot still on the clutch. Second gear is usually right below first gear.

, Resting your foot on top of the clutch causes unnecessary pressure and could result in premature wear on your clutch.

, If the car starts to shake, begin to press down on the clutch. When you have slowed to under 10 mph (16 km/h), you can shift into neutral and take your foot off the clutch while still holding down on the brake pad.


Alternately, you can shift into neutral, take your foot off the clutch, and press down on the brake pad until your car has come to a complete stop.

Note: if you don't hold down the clutch (or use neutral) as you brake and as your RPM lowers, your car will start to shake and your engine will stall. While riding your clutch while your engine is going is not a good idea (it'll wear out the clutch), you also don't want your engine to stall. Once you're comfortable with the technique, get in the habit of shifting into neutral instead of riding your clutch.

Note: if you just want to brake a little bit, you don't have to depress the clutch. If you're in gear just need to slow down a little, your car isn't in danger of stalling.

Move the mirrors so you can see behind and to the sides of the vehicle clearly. Identify the car's blind spots before you start driving, so that you can check them before making any turns or lane changes.








, It essential to find the accelerator and brake pedals, the steering wheel, the gear selector lever, the light controls, the defroster, and the windshield wipers before you begin.









The brake and accelerator pedals are located at the bottom front of the area where your feet are. The brake pedal is on the left, the accelerator is on the right.
The steering wheel is the large wheel in the center of the driver's console. Turn it to the left and right to turn the wheels of the vehicle.
Located on the steering column (usually on the left side) is a small lever that has a rest position in the middle and two locking positions above and below. This is the turn signal. Often on the left side of the steering wheel mounted into the console or a knob on one of the levers on the steering column is the control which turns the headlights on and off.
The gear selector lever will usually be in one of two places: it is either mounted to the right side of the steering column or in-between the driver's and passenger's seats. It will have a display showing gear indicators, usually marked with the letters ""P"", ""D"", ""N"", and ""R"" and a few numbers. On steering-column shifting levers, this display is usually located on the instrument panel, underneath the speedometer.

, Ensure that you and any passengers in your vehicle are wearing seat belts at all times.








, Place your right foot on the brake pedal and push it down, then insert the key and turn it clockwise to start the vehicle.








, Keep your foot on the brake pedal and shift the gear lever into ""Drive."" This gear is marked with a ""D"" on the display panel, and will be highlighted when you've successfully selected it.









For shift levers mounted on the steering column, pull the lever towards you before moving it up and down to select a gear.
For shift levers mounted on the floor, there is usually a side button to unlock the lever. It can then be moved along its track into position.

, This is either a lever between the two front seats or a pedal on the far left side of the foot area. There may be a release lever above the lower parking brake or a button to push on the topside model before you can disengage it.








, Look all around the car, including blind spots, to see if there are any moving objects or beings in the vicinity. Make sure to keep your eyes mainly on the direction you're moving.








, Slowly release pressure on the brake pedal and the car will start to move slowly. Take your foot off the brake, use the same foot to press the gas pedal gently, and the car will begin to move faster. There is no need to change gears in relation to speed in regular road driving.








, In ""drive,"" turn it to the left to turn the car left and turn it to the right to turn the car right.








, Take your right foot off the accelerator pedal and move it to the brake, applying gradual pressure so as not to jerk to a halt. When you wish to start again, switch your foot back to the accelerator.








, When you have reached your destination, bring the vehicle to a complete stop by applying gradual pressure to the brake pedal and slide the shift lever back into the ""P"" position. Turn off the engine by turning the key counter-clockwise. Don't forget to turn off the headlights and apply the parking brake before getting out of the car.








, If you need to travel backward, make sure the vehicle is at a complete stop before changing gears in or out of ""reverse."" Slide the gear shift to select the gear marked ""R"" and check behind/ around you for any possible obstructions. Gently remove your foot from the brake and place it on the accelerator.









When turning in Reverse, your car will turn in the same direction that you turn the wheel. You're just going backwards, so the end of the car will swing in that direction, rather than the front.

, The ""neutral"" gear is only to be used when you have no need to control the speed of your car, not when driving regularly. Examples of this include when idling parked for a short time or when being pushed/towed., The gears marked ""1,"" ""2,"" and ""3"" are known as lower gears. These can work as a sort of in-engine brake system when you need to save your actual brakes. Going down steep hills is a good use of this technique. 1st gear, however, is only to be used when you must go very slowly. There is no need to stop when shifting between these gears and Drive."

Use two hands to steer when turning.,
Never go faster than you feel comfortable controlling.,
Press the brake with your right foot firmly to stop.,
Put the vehicle in park or set the parking brake when you’re done.",How to Drive a Car in Reverse Gear2," The dynamic of driving in reverse is quite different than that of normal driving because the wheels you turn to steer are at the front of the car. As you back up, make small adjustments by turning the wheel in the direction you want the back of the car to turn toward.Turning the wheel to the left as you back up will cause the back of the car to go left and vice versa.
Stop the car if you feel uneasy about the direction it is heading, then set off again once you’ve gained control.

, As you turn the vehicle, the front end of the car will swing in the opposite direction the back end is turning. Check the area around the front of the car frequently as you back up slowly to ensure you don’t hit or run over anything with the front wheels.If you are turning left as you back up, the front of the car will swing to the right, and vice versa.
Make sure you are going slowly enough that you can check the front of the car for clearance without hitting anything.

, If you are backing up a hill or need to turn, you may need to utilize the gas pedal occasionally while backing up. Once your right foot is completely off of the brake, move it over the gas pedal to the right of the brake. Press down on the pedal slowly to control the amount of speed you pick up as you back up.Make subtle adjustments to your speed by applying pressure to the gas pedal.
Bring your foot back to the brake once you have gained sufficient speed or if you need to slow back down.

, If you need to turn around an obstacle while backing up, you may want to use both hands to manipulate the steering wheel. Using one hand, you can usually only turn the wheel up to ninety degrees in each direction, so if you need to take a steeper turn, using both hands may help. Make sure that you can still see behind you as you place your right hand back on the wheel if you need to.Never cross your hands over one another while turning the wheel. Instead push the wheel with one hand and pull it with the other.

, Backing up can feel quite different than driving forward, and your view is often compromised by the back of the car and a limited view out of your window. Do not hurry yourself while backing up and instead take your time to prevent accidents.Never drive your vehicle in a manner that feels unsafe.
Feel free to stop the vehicle and take a minute if you feel uncertain about what you’re doing.

, When you’ve backed up far enough, press your foot back down on the brake pedal gradually to come to a smooth stop. Be careful not to apply too much pressure too quickly, or you will stop the vehicle abruptly.Use only your right foot to apply the brakes in your vehicle.
Keep your foot pressed on the brake once the vehicle has stopped.

, With your foot firmly on the brake pedal, press the button the shift lever in automatic vehicles and press it forward until it is aligned with the “P” that indicates that it is in park. In standard transmission equipped vehicles, simply take the shift lever out of gear (in neutral) and apply the parking brake by pulling up on the handle or pressing down on the pedal.If you are unsure where to locate your parking brake or how to engage it, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.

Check your mirrors before you begin.,
Check each mirror frequently.,
Enlist the help of a friend.",How to Drive a Car in Reverse Gear3," If you cannot see out the back of the vehicle, you will need to use your side mirrors to see as you back up. Before you begin, adjust your side mirrors to ensure you can see the side of the vehicle, the ground, and anything coming up from behind you.In many cars you can adjust both mirrors from the driver’s seat, but in some you may need to adjust them manually by hand on each side.

, Using mirrors will only show you what is behind your vehicle on either side, so it’s important to check both sides often. This will prevent you from accidentally hitting something, or from not noticing as someone approaches from one side or the other.You likely will need to drive even slower in reverse when using mirrors to be sure you don’t miss anything.
It may help to pay closer attention to the mirror on a side with an obstacle, so you can keep your eyes on it.

, If you are backing up using only your mirrors in a difficult area, you may choose to ask a friend to guide you. Using your mirrors to keep an eye on a friend that is checking your clearances from the back may be your best option when driving a box truck or something else with severely limited visibility.Have your friend stand behind the vehicle on one side to ensure you can see them as they guide you.
Make sure to open your windows and turn off the radio to hear your friend’s instructions as you back up.

Follow the signal directions at controlled intersections.,
Turn ""right on red"" at a stoplight if there is no sign telling you otherwise.,
Yield to cars already at an uncontrolled intersection.,
Yield to the larger road at intersections with multiple-lane roads.,
Yield to oncoming traffic at T-intersections.,
Treat the traffic light like a stop sign if it is not functioning.

",How to Determine Who Has Right of Way2," At intersections with traffic lights or stop signs, obey the signals! This simple step is the easiest way to stay out of trouble. You don’t have to worry about right of way because the traffic light is calculating it for you. Just stay in your lane and wait until the light turns green. That means you are allowed to go. A blinking red light means that you should treat the stoplight as a stop sign. Stop, yield to others already at the intersection, and then continue on your way. If you arrive at the intersection at the same time as another person, the car to the right goes first.
A blinking yellow light means proceed with caution. You should go slow, and there may be a crosswalk ahead. Yield to anyone in the crosswalk.
You must yield to emergency vehicles with their lights on even if you have a green light.

, If you see a sign saying ""no right on red"" then you must wait for the light to turn green again. Similarly, if there is a red arrow pointing right inside the stop light, you must wait for the light to turn green. You are never allowed to turn right on red in New York City.

, If you and another car arrive at the intersection at the same time, then yield to the car to the right. It isn’t always easy to determine who arrived at the intersection first, so try to make eye contact with the other driver. This will help you establish who is going to go first. Flashing your lights is an indication that you want them to go first. If they flash their lights at you, that means they are waiting for you to go. , When a one- or two-lane road intersects with a larger road, the driver on the smaller road must yield to cars on the multi-lane road. Wait for a safe opening in the traffic before you try to enter into the multi-lane road. Never expect the traffic to stop for you. If you have to come to a complete stop before entering the multi-lane road, that’s okay.

, When a road dead-ends into a through street, the driver on the dead-end road must yield to traffic on the other street. You don’t want to go driving out into oncoming traffic. Oftentimes these intersections will have a stop sign, but if not yield right of way to oncoming traffic.

When an access road intersects with a highway exit ramp, drivers on the access road must yield to cars on the exit ramp, even if the traffic leaving the freeway merges into a separate lane.

, If you are taking a left turn into a parking lot or onto another road make sure you always yield to oncoming traffic. Don’t expect the traffic to stop for you. Wait until there is a safe gap in the traffic for you to turn.

, This is self-explanatory. Yield signs will pop up all over the place at strange intersections and at rotaries. Yield to the oncoming traffic if a yield sign is in place. You will often see yield signs to the right of traffic signals if there is a separate lane that turns right before the light. Follow the signs directions.

Learn how to decelerate by downshifting.,
Know what gear you should be in based on your RPM and your speed.,
Know that you can kick into any gear from neutral provided you are going fast enough.",How to Drive a Stick2," You can brake or decelerate your car by downshifting instead of applying pressure on the brake pad. In order to do this:
Remove your foot from the accelerator and let the car naturally decelerate.






Depress the clutch and move the gear lever into the gear immediately below the gear you're currently in.






Continue allowing the car to decelerate naturally.






When your speed hits the next lowest gear's wheelhouse, downshift again. Continue downshifting until you've hit first gear. Using this technique requires more space and more time to decelerate.







, If you're in second gear and your RPM is through the roof, you should shift into third gear soon. If you're in fourth gear and your RPM is really low, you should probably downshift into third gear. Here's a rundown of approximately what gear you should be in according to how fast you are going. Speeds and gears will vary depending on what car you drive:
0–15 mph (0–24 km/h): First gear






15–30 mph (24–48 km/h): Second gear






30–45 mph (48–72 km/h): Third gear






45–60 mph (72–97 km/h): Fourth gear






60 mph (97 km/h) and above: Fifth gear






75 mph (121 km/h) and above: Sixth gear (not all cars have six gears)







, One cool thing about having a manual transmission is that you can kick your car into neutral very easily and just ""coast."" Perhaps you reached the top of a mountain and are now going downhill. Instead of accelerating by shifting, you can let the car accelerate by putting the car into neutral.


If you're in neutral and going 40 mph (64 km/h), you should shift directly into fourth gear. If you're in neutral and going 15 mph (24 km/h), you should shift directly into second gear, and so on.

Heed larger vehicles.",How to Be a Great Driver2," If you practice in different driving situations, your ability to drive well will increase dramatically.








, This is really helpful. Always think one or two steps ahead of your current action to reduce hesitation while driving. This will help you avoid accidents.








, If there is a person who has the potential to distract you from driving, have them sit in the back and refrain from talking to you.








, One of the worst things you can do while driving is to hesitate. If you choose to move to some area, make sure it is safe and then do so without hesitation. Drivers who hesitate and make jerky moves can make driving conditions hazardous to others around them.








, There are many cases where the weather can pose a problem for drivers. Try to avoid these conditions as much as possible by watching the weather forecast. Practice driving in rainy, snowy, frosty and windy weather conditions within a safe environment, such as an abandoned car park.








, By driving needlessly dangerously, you only show others you do not believe in your driving skills.








, A good driver might overtake while seamlessly passing oncoming traffic with just two smooth flow-motion manoeuvres, while a clumsy driver will make driving straight on a deserted road look dangerous. There's a simple rule: All considerations must be taken before commencing the manoeuvre. Once you decide to do something, do it without hesitation. For example: Overtaking with an oncoming traffic is a hard decision to take. Once you decide on it, other drivers will be willing to slow down or move aside to let you pass, as long as you maintain your speed and heading. Understanding that you don't have the distance or engine power to complete the overtaking and hitting the brakes in the opposite side of the road would only bewilder any oncoming driver, who would be otherwise willing to slow down or get half of their vehicle in the shoulder of the road to let you by.








, Get used to the maximum speed, acceleration, turn radius, overall size and stability of your vehicle. If you're a seasoned 18-wheeler driver, overtaking with only 2 inches (5.1 cm) of lateral distance wouldn't be a problem for you. If you just got your light vehicle driving license (B category in the EU, also known as a 'child's permit'), you need greater distance.








, Never threaten large vehicles with your driving! Professional truck drivers are capable of handling situations that would get a less experienced driver killed. If you have a child's permit, remember those 18-wheelers are very quick in their acceleration and very hard in stopping! When you wait for a left turn and you see a 20-tonne Mercedes Actros coming your way, don't rely on the fact it's going to slow down, or be too clumsy to hit you! These modern tractors are capable of moving at 170 km/h (110 mph) especially when fully laden, and most of them do 0 to 100 faster than your car.









However, a head-on collision between a car and a tractor has never been won by the car hitherto!

Check the road conditions on the website of your local news.,
Find out conditions on a local department of transportation website.,
Use an online national road condition information service.,
Verify road conditions with a shipping website.,
Plan an alternate route when necessary.",How to Check Road Conditions1," In many areas of North America, states or regions offer a free-to-use app through the 5-1-1 road information service.Search for something like ""5-1-1 road closure app for Michigan"" in the app store to find one suitable for where you live.


Local departments of transportation may also offer apps for checking road conditions. Search the app store for ""traffic apps for Chicago"" or something similar.
The main news stations for your area may also support apps that update weather and road conditions. Look for apps like these in the app store by searching it for a local news station.;
, Many of these navigation apps update road and traffic conditions in real time. Three common apps like this include Waze, Google Maps, and INRIX.Download these from the app store and use them to navigate to your destination.

, The website for your local news should provide up-to-date information on road closures and conditions. This information can usually be navigated to by selecting the “Weather” or “Traffic” button at the top or side of the page.


Some sites include interactive maps that provide additional information. Some, for example, estimate the amount of time it will take to reach your destination in current conditions.

, The websites of regional or local departments of transportation usually include road condition information. Depending on the services provided in your region, there may also be a number available to call the department directly.In some communities, especially smaller ones, you may have a road commission instead of an official department of transportation.

, Some countries have a national or international road condition information service. In North American countries, the road condition hotline (accessible by dialing 5-1-1 on a phone) often also provides online updates.Most region-specific 5-1-1 updates can be found with an online keyword search for something like, “5-1-1 online updates for Michigan.”

, Shipping and freight companies rely on accurate road information to transport things in a timely fashion. Do an online keyword search for “road conditions for truck drivers” to find road condition informational websites like these.


Two common websites used by truck drivers include TruckMiles.com and WideLoadShipping.com.Many of these sites are intended for drivers on the road and are formatted for mobile browsers., If the conditions are poor or certain roads closed, you’ll have to find a different route or stay home. Many map services, like GoogleMaps, Waze, and MapQuest, allow you to choose options like “Avoid Highways” for when highways are unsafe.Most services also offer a few alternate routes with every search for directions.


Send directions from the map service to your phone so you can reference them should you get lost. Avoid looking at the directions while driving, as this can dangerously distract you.Some drivers may feel most comfortable with a physical copy of the directions on hand. If this is true for you, print out the map and directions before leaving.

Pick a highway and a time.,
Learn to operate the car at lower speeds first.,
Make sure your car's brakes, lights, turn signals, steering, transmission and all other parts are working safely.,
Start on a day when the weather is clear and dry.,
Start driving from your driveway, then head for the freeway on-ramp.,
As you come up the on-ramp, use your turn signal, check your blind spot and mirrors, look forward again and merge onto the highway.,
Practice changing lanes as you cruise down the highway.,
Once you're comfortable changing lanes, try passing other cars.,
When you're ready to get off the highway, find an appropriate off-ramp and get in the correct lane, using the steps to change lanes.,
Once you're off the highway, you can go home, or look for another on-ramp and practice more highway driving.

",How to Begin Driving on Freeways for a Novice Driver," It's best to start when you know the highway will not be crowded. Weekends and evenings are best. Pay attention to the traffic reports in your area. Make sure you know exactly where you're going and you don't have any place to go for a while.;
, Make sure you know all the laws and ""rules of the road,"" including what different kinds of lanes look like and the local speed limits.

, Get the car inspected and fixed if necessary. The freeway is the worst possible place for a breakdown.

, Darkness and inclement weather make driving more difficult and should not be the beginner's first step.

, Don't take the on-ramp too fast, but when you come off it you should be going close to the speed of freeway traffic (whatever that may be at the time).

, You must watch for cars on the freeway and adjust your speed to enter the freeway safely. Although many people will change lanes to the left to give merging cars more room, it is not their responsibility to let you onto the freeway. Once you've safely merged onto the freeway, match your speed to the flow of traffic.

, Use your turn signal, mirrors, and glance at your blind spot every single time. Remember when driving on freeways that you should always stay in the furthest lane to the right unless you are passing a slower moving vehicle in front of you. You have probably seen signs which read, ""KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS."" If everyone followed this rule traffic congestion would be much less severe. If you are in the 'faster' lanes (left lanes) and there is a large space in front of you and many cars behind you YOU ARE OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC. Safely change lanes toward the right to allow traffic to pass. It is not your job to enforce speed limits by obstructing traffic on the freeway.

, Make sure to give them lots of room, and don't ever cut in front of anybody.

, As soon as the off-ramp breaks away from the main highway, start slowing down.

Listen for the road condition information on local TV news.,
Keep the TV tuned to local news to hear new closures.,
Tune in to local radio news.,
Set your radio to designated road condition radio stations.,
Call a road condition hotline.,
Contact the location to which you’re traveling.",How to Check Road Conditions2," Switch your TV on and open the channel guide to find your local news station. Frequently, low numbered channels, like channels 4, 7, and 12, feature local news. Your local news should talk about weather and road conditions at regular intervalsThe segment on weather and road conditions may be short. If you walk away and miss the report, you’ll have to wait for the next update.

, As conditions worsen, new roads may become dangerous and be closed. Keep your television on in the background as you get ready to leave so you can listen for possible new closures.


You may want to mute the TV so you aren’t distracted by less important news. Set a timer for the next road condition report and unmute the TV to hear new closures.
During extreme weather, like thunderstorms or snowstorms, most local TV news increases the frequency of road condition reporting.

, Local radio news usually will update traffic conditions hourly, if not more frequently. In severe weather conditions or in the event of a traffic jam, more frequent updates or special live reports are common.


Listening to radio reports in your car won't be as distracting or dangerous as checking conditions on your phone while driving., These stations are oftentimes advertised alongside highways. Keep an eye out for roadside signs with the station settings for these services. When you see the station number, set your radio to that frequency.


Radio stations like this are generally for a designated area or region. When traveling long distances or across state lines, you may need to change to a new designated traffic station., This might take the form of a designated local, state, or federal phone number. Find these numbers online at the websites of local, state, or federal departments of transportation.Call the number and follow the directions provided to check road conditions.In most areas in the US and Canada, you can reach the a road condition hotline by dialing 5-1-1 on your phone.The condition of government roads in Australia can be checked by making a free call to the government funded hotline at 1800-246-199.5-1-1 road condition information is generally set up to update twice every hour in severe weather, though it may update less frequently in mild weather., Although major closures should be listed on the road condition hotline, the exact severity of conditions might not be clear. Call someone at the location you’re headed to for a more detailed idea of the conditions of local roads.


In severe weather, many schools, workplaces, and vacationing spots try to provide phone support about road conditions or the establishment’s open/closed status.

Focus.,
Allow someone to pass, if you happen to see them going beyond the speed limit.,
Use your turn signals, and use them at the right time.,
Never switch lanes when in the middle of an intersection.,
NEVER try to ""beat the light."",
Keep in mind that it is courteous to allow a vehicle to turn into traffic if the driver is waiting for a break.,
Remember: maintaining a decently comfortable distance between you and the driver ahead of you is an excellent rule of thumb.,
Note that residential areas are common grounds for children to run spontaneously into the streets without looking for oncoming cars.,
Remember that trucks often give their drivers difficulty stopping, turning, or backing up, we, as drivers, have all witnessed this.,
Be courteous of the senior citizens, as well.,
Make an effort to change lanes when safe if you see utility work, police and emergency vehicles up ahead, or see a lane starting to slow down to a crawl while the opposite lanes are open or have less traffic.,
Understand that the majority of drivers just aim to get to their destination, just like everyone else does.,
If you are signaled to stop by the police, be nice to the officer and they may let you go despite violating a traffic law.,
Don't use the shoulder or median to get around people not moving with traffic.",How to Be a Better Driver," Paying attention to the traffic around you, frequently surveying your mirrors, and anticipating what other drivers are going to do is the most important step to becoming a courteous and safe driver.;
, This is no 1950s drag race. Proving your need for speed leads to dangerous circumstances between your car and other cars. You should almost always be in the right-most lane, except when passing others. The exceptions would be if you are anticipating a left turn, or a left-sided exit on the expressway. Staying in the right-most lane will allow others traveling faster than you to get around you safely and avoid them having to pass you on the right side, which is discouraged as it is not as safe a maneuver.

, Notify other drivers of your intent to turn or to change lanes early enough that they are able to take appropriate action. Sitting at a red light is NOT the right time to turn on your blinker; if you had done so earlier, the person behind you would have been able to change lanes and avoid sitting behind you when the light turns green.

, Also, time your entry into an intersection so that you don't get caught blocking it once the light turns red (i.e. ""don't block the box"").

, If the light turns yellow and you have enough space to stop safely, then stop. Cyclists, pedestrians, and even other drivers expect you to be completely stopped by the time the light turns red. You endanger yourself and others by running yellow lights, only to save a minute or two, it simply isn't worth it.

, Do not, however, suddenly slam the brakes in moving traffic in order to let a driver enter. This will most likely lead to a fender bender or worse, a collision from the unsuspecting driver behind you. This occurred at least once, killing the driver who drove behind the car that had suddenly braked in constantly moving traffic. Drivers in moving traffic never expect a sudden brake. Be extremely careful.

, You should keep at least 2 to 4 seconds distance between you and the person in front of you. You can use the signs or the paint dashes to judge this distance. Perhaps if the vehicle in front suddenly stalls or stops, you as a driver have enough room to stop safely, or turn into the next lane without causing a backup in traffic. Other weather-related conditions, such as snow and rain, also make it wise to prevent collisions by keeping a safe distance behind for slippery, sliding and swerving cars.

, Their minds focus on retrieving their ball in the street or catching up to friends by suddenly crossing roads on bikes, for instance. When driving through residential streets, be wary of unpredictable objects and people in the streets.

, When passing a semi-truck, keep in mind that the truck driver has more difficulty braking. It is best to wait until you can see the truck in your rear-view mirror before completing a pass. Also avoid remaining beside a truck when in multi-lane traffic, if you cannot see the truck driver through his/her mirror, then he/she cannot see you.

, Senior citizens need to drive just like everyone else. This is especially the case when they have no other means to obtain essentials. Most senior citizens, however, tend to prefer driving during early afternoons when there is less traffic and more daylight. When driving behind a senior citizen, always keep a safe distance and watch for unexpected moves, such as lane changes. Some seniors may change lanes without prior signaling.

, Odds are there's an accident, stalled car, or on the shoulder someone is pulled over, broken down car etc. By doing so you make yourself less prone to be in a secondary accident and it helps people who are in a dangerous or bad situation.

, Accidents happen, but you can take a few steps to prevent many of them from occurring, either to yourself or others. By understanding the way various drivers react, you will have a better grasp of how to be a better driver. The best drivers learn to anticipate possible changes in traffic, and prepare for them in advance by adjusting their speed, their lane/direction, or where their attention is directed.

, It will depend on what you did and the traffic conditions as to the offense. Not all officers are out to write tickets.

, You will get nailed no matter how many cars you pass.

This is usually on the side facing the side door. Pull it up until your seat is as close to a 90-degree angle as possible., The farther you're sitting from the dashboard, the safer you'll be in a collision. Move the handle under your seat, usually right in the middle, to move the seat forward or backward. If you're driving, make sure you can see well out of all windows and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the steering wheel.If you're vertically challenged, purchase an accessory specially designed to adjust your height in a vehicle. Pillows, books, and other quick fixes can slide and actually cause you to crash. Contact your local AAA club or auto insurance provider for assistance., Place your hips and back firmly against the seat back. You shouldn't have any room between the backs of your shoulders and the seat. This is to make sure your seat belt fits snugly and keeps you in place during a crash. If you slouch, you're putting yourself at risk for serious injuries like strangulation., The headrest is designed to keep your head from snapping back in a crash. Position it so that it's level with the tops of your ears and as close to your head as possible. Don't literally rest your head on the headrest while driving or as a passenger., Don't slip it behind your back or under your arm.If you're pregnant, make sure the strap runs between your breasts and clear of your baby bump.You can skip this step if you're in an older car whose seat belt only goes across the lap.

Pull the buckle over the folded area and turn it the right way around.This might require some patience, but it's well worth your time to protect your safety.

, If the strap feels like it's cutting into your neck, try moving your seat forward or backward. Newer cars allow you to correct this issue with a restraint system. If all else fails, purchase a padded seat belt cover. You can find these in most big box stores., If your belt is pulling you too tightly, part of it is probably stuck. Since each make and model is assembled differently, read your car user's manual for specific instructions. In many cases, pulling on the shoulder strap while the belt is unbuckled will do the trick. If this doesn't work and you're not trained in auto mechanics, take your car to your dealership if it's under warranty. If not, take it to a reputable mechanic.

Use the air-conditioning to demist fumes on the windshields, and to provide a comfortable environment.",How to Adjust Seating to the Proper Position While Driving," Driving should be done with clothing that doesn’t limit the driver. In the winter, coats can interfere with proper steering as well as with proper adjustment of the seat and the operation of seat belts. Choose light and comfortable clothes.


Footwear is obligatory. The shoes have to be placed snugly on the feet (unlike slippers) and fit nicely on the pedals (unlike boots, muddy soles, or high heels). A shoe with a thin but slightly dense sole is ideal.
The driver is also advised to wear a set of pants that run all the way down to the knee, even if it means wearing a set of pants over shorts or a swim-suit.;
, Make sure you sit straight and that your buttocks and back are square and completely squeezed into the seat. This helps to avoid backaches, possible back injuries and maintains awareness during long drives.

, The seat should always be positioned with regard to the pedals. Press the brake pedal fully with your right foot and fully depress the clutch (in a manual transmission car) or dead pedal (in an automatic). The distance should be adjusted so that with fully depressed pedals, your knees remain slightly bent (about 120 degrees).


To make sure your check is accurate, start the engine and press on the brakes a few times before performing the check to build up pressure.
If the knee straightens, you are too far back. If it's bent close to 90 degrees, it's too close.
A fully extended leg results in the knee locking-up. This reduces the leverage and feel of the pedals, increases effort, and puts you in risk of severe injuries to the feet in a collision;the straight knee will be fractured whereas the bent knee would fold down. Furthermore, the bone would project the shock up to the pelvic and lower spine.
A knee excessively bent (when the driver sits too close) at an angle of about 100 degrees, does not support the body effectively and results in bad blood circulation. It can also hit the under-dash in a collision.
The thighs should be placed as far apart as is comfortable. In small cars, most people can create a wide enough base as to lean their knees against the center console on one side and the door on the other.
The feet should be placed with the heels on the floor and the balls of the feet pressing against the pedals. The right foot in particular should be able to pivot between the throttle and brake pedal while the heel is placed roughly in front of the brakes. This might mean that you don't cover the brake pedal fully when pressing it and that pressing the throttle is done with the foot at an angle, contacting the pedal close to its lower edge. This is the correct way to utilize the feet.
The left foot should be resting over the dead-pedal whenever not working on the clutch (or, in an automatic, at all times). This increases support to the pelvis and allows the driver to brace the body by applying pressure against the footrest in corners or in events of strong braking instead of hanging onto the pedals or steering.

, This should be as parallel as possible to the steering. It is impossible to reach a perfect adjustment (and it's also not really necessary), but by adjusting the rake of the seat to an upright angle of about 110-95 degrees, we can reach a suitable adjustment.


We cannot reach a perfect adjustment because placing the seat too upright will put pressure on the lower vertebrae, place our head too high, and because the steering itself is placed in an angle. We can adjust the seat back to a relatively upright position and then use the adjustment of the steering itself to place it as parallel to the back as possible.
After adjusting the seat, including the height and the adjustments to the steering itself (below), we check the adjustment in the following manner: We place the wrist of our hand just over the topmost portion of the wheel. We should be able to place the wrist flat over the wheel and even bend it somewhat over the rim, while still keeping the shoulders (shoulder-blades) against the seat's back. This should be done with the arm straight but without putting in excessive effort.

If our wrist only touches the face of the wheel (rather than be placed flat over it), or it we can only put the heel of the palm on the wheel, or if we need to lean our scapulae (shoulder-blades) forward -- we are too far back. This will make us lean forward somewhat when we steer.
If we can touch the top of the wheel with our forearm or touch the top of the wheel with the wrist with the hand bent, we are too close to the wheel.
In vehicles with large, horizontal steering rims (mainly trucks), we cannot reach such a posture and we just need to check that we can grip the topmost portion of the wheel without locking the elbow fully and without bouncing the scapulae forward.



, Where adjustable, the steering height should be adjusted to as parallel to back angle, and to a clear view of the dashboard through the rim. The ideal adjustment should also allow us to grip the wheel properly (at 9 and 3, see below), with our palms just lower than our shoulders.

, Where adjustable, this should be adjusted with the steering wheel height, to as parallel to the back as possible. While gripping the wheel properly, our elbows should be bent at about 120 degrees. There should be a minimal clearance of 10"" (and preferably 30cm) between the center of the steering hub and the base of the breastbone (sternum). It should also not be further away that 45 centimeter (17.7 in).

, This should allow us to see forward clearly, while still having a clear view of the dashboard, and proper height relative to the wheel and pedals. In most cars, the proper height for forward vision should allow us to place five fingers (a hand width) between our head and the ceiling.


In cars with open or high ceiling, adjust so that you eyes are placed just above the center of the glass, without the visor obstructing your forward vision when open.
After readjusting the height, recheck the feet to make sure the height adjust had not compromised it.

, Place the headrest to a height just above your eyelids, and (more importantly) -- as close to the head as possible (2-3cm). A head-restraint further than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) increases the risk of whiplash. Keep in mind that while driving our head bends forward a bit more. If you cannot adjust the head-restraint to the proper distance, you need to compensate by increasing the backrest tilt.

,


Lumbar support: Should provide equal pressure across the whole length of the back. For drivers with lumbar problems without such an adjustment, you can use one or two rolled towels.
Side Bolsters: Should be adjusted for the maximum possible hip support without limiting the ability to depress all pedals fully.
Seat base reclining: Should keep the thigh in full contact with the seat. Avoid too much reclining which will create pressure behind your knees, or interfere with strong braking (you should not apply pressure against the seat).
Pedal adjustments: Should allow operation of the pedals as described above as comfortably as possible. You should be able to place your heel roughly in front of the brakes, place your foot on the brakes with the slightest possible offset to the right, and pivot as easily as possible towards the throttle pedal on the right, while keeping your knee bent at about 100 degrees.

, Your hands should both be on the wheel, at the 9 and 3 position. This increases the leverage on the wheel to a maximum. Your palms should be placed against the outer diameter of the wheel and the thumbs should be lightly hooked on the cross-brace of the wheel.


Grip and stabilize the wheel not only with the thumbs and/or palms, but mainly with your fingers and fingertips. In general, keep the grip of the wheel as light as possible without losing your control over the wheel. This results in better control and less fatigue.
Keep both hands on the wheel. Steering with one hand makes the weight of the hand work on the wheel, for which the shoulder muscles must be used to keep the wheel steady, resulting in a twist of the spine, especially if you get into the (bad) habit of holding the wheel from its top.

, Adjust the lap-belt as snugly as possible over the waist. The belt should be physically tightened and placed as low as possible, on the pelvic bones, rather than the soft belly.


The shoulder strap should be adjusted to the height, so that the mounting is higher than the shoulder, and that the strap itself is placed over the acromion (middle of the shoulder), which is felt as a socket midway between the arm and neck.
If the shoulder strap is placed on the neck or even on the collar bone (clavicle), it is too high and will cause fractures to the clavicle and cuts the neck.
If the strap is placed too low on the shoulder itself or on the arm/under the armpit, it will not support the body and cause severe cuts to the arm.
All passengers should be strapped, and little children need to be harnessed in the suitable child seats and boosters. There are also special straps for pets. There are also other points that are worthwhile for the passengers:

Head restraint adjustment
Window adjustment
Proper placing of limbs relative to airbags: Avoid placing feet over the passenger's airbag or placing hands in the way of the lateral or curtain airbags, etc...
Proper distance from the dashboard
Full and erected seating: Full contact of the back and the seat, and an erected rake angle for the front passenger, to avoid ""submarining under the lap belt.
Awareness: Falling asleep is dangerous for passengers. The front passenger should be awake to monitor and assist the driver, and to avoid acute abdominal injuries in a collision, which are intensified when the person is asleep.


Not all seats of the car are equally safe. The middle-rear seat is considered safest, followed by the seat behind front passenger seat, then the seat behind the driver, the front passenger seat and the driver being in the greatest threat. This division changes in cars with additional seats (minivans) or when the middle-back lacks a diagonal or adjustable belt or a head-restraint.

, With this position, your eyes will be placed in front of the center or upper half of the glass for improved visibility. Keep your eyes relaxed rather than trying and focus, and keep the eyes up rather than down. You will see more and further away, while still being aware of your surrounding with your peripheral vision.


Adjust your mirrors to give you a broad field of vision to the rear and sides (see in links below) at the glance of an eye or a slight tilt of the head (if you have a narrow field of vision due to illness or age). In some cars, you might also need to be ready to lean slightly forward or take a slight peek to the side (""Shoulder check"") to make sure you see everything around while driving.

, Do not keep anything around the driver's seat, because it might slip under the pedals.


In general, anything not stock is not wanted: A convex mirror mounted on the center mirror, a padded cover of the steering wheel, things dangling about on your rear-view mirror -- these are all bad things that can also prove hazardous in an accident.
Windows, in this respect, are best either completely closed, slightly opened or almost fully opened, rather than half-way down, in which case the head of the driver or one of the passengers might hit it. Always keep one of your front windows slightly opened for fresh air.
Open windows on highways can create drag that impairs fuel consumption and even the stability of the car, so it's best to only keep one or two windows slightly opened at most.
On rugged terrain, the windows should be fully closed or fully opened to avoid rocking the window's bushings.
Windows, lights and spectacles should be kept clean.

,


While it is possible to fit a quality, vacuum-adhesive interior mirror to view the back seat, in long drives with the whole family, it's best for the front passenger to be the one in charge of the inside of the car, and for the driver to focus himself on the road. Do not adjust your stock interior mirror to see the back seat and do not use wide-angle convex mirrors as well.
Likewise, avoid placing a child in the front seat, regardless of child restraints or airbags.

, It's better to use the car heat in the winter instead of driving with heavy clothing that interferes with steering and with the function of the seat belt. Keep one window slightly open for fresh air both in the summer (for oxygen) and winter (for fresh cold air).


The air conditioning is there to be used -- open the A/C periodically, even in the winter, and open the heating periodically -- even in the summer -- to ensure proper mechanical function of the two over time.
A/C air recirculation is very efficient because is blows large amounts of air. However, you need some fresh air through the driver's window. Likewise, if the windscreen is very heavily misted, opening the A/C for fresh air (along with an open window) can do better. Using external circulation is also efficient when you try to cool down a very hot cabin before entering it.
The A/C can also clear out bad smells. A few minutes before you turn off the car, close the air conditioner and air circulation, but keep the fan blowing air. This will channel out waste in the air ducts via a little hose inside it. Likewise, in a hot summer day, it's worthwhile to keep the heating blowing full time with all windows and doors open, to refresh the cabin.
The heating is also a good choice for when the engine starts to overheat. In highways, stopping on the hard-shoulder is so perilous that it is better to keep on driving towards a safe stopping place, even in the price of causing damage to the car (like overheating the engine). Using the heating to disperse engine heat can help reaching a safe stopping place without the engine reaching critical levels of heat.

Check traffic before you leave.,
Avoid construction areas.,
Check for sporting events and festivals.,
Sign up for a carpool.,
Plan an alternate route.,
Take advantage of electronic tolling.,
Avoid rush hours.,
Drive on the weekends.,
Keep tabs on the weather.",How to Avoid Traffic1," Many local and national government websites offer up-to-the-minute traffic data for most major roads. Checking these can give you an idea about travel times, and help you to decide whether to take an alternate route.


Useful national traffic information sites include the USDOT Federal Highway Administration’s National Traffic and Road Closure Information,and Traffic England.;
, If you’ll be travelling on highways or in a city during the warmer months, there is a good chance you could encounter traffic caused by road construction. In this case, you might want to plan an alternate route. You can find out just where construction is taking place by using the local and national governmental sites that provide updated information on roads under construction.


Some national sites with road construction information include Highways England,and the USDOT Federal Highway Administration’s National Traffic and Road Closure Information., Highways near sports stadiums can become congested two hours before and two hours after games. Check your local professional teams’ schedules to see whether a match will be taking place within two hours after or before you plan to drive on these highways. If this is the case, consider alternate routes. Take similar precautions with large city festivals.

, Driving with friends or co-workers during high traffic times is an excellent way to reduce traffic. By carpooling you can save money on gas while reducing pollution. Carpooling vehicles can also take advantage of usually traffic-free carpool lanes in some cities.


Ask your co-workers about setting up a carpool, or connect to online carpooling networks such as Ridesharing.comor Erideshare.com., Check traffic websites, and use GPS systems and software to help you plan alternate routes past familiar congestion areas. Try to plan at least two routes, in case the best secondary way is congested itself or under construction. Having several optional routes planned will allow you to adjust on the fly, without having to check maps or ask for directions.


Sometimes an alternate route on city streets or state highways can get you to your destination faster than the congested road. But sometimes they can take longer, especially if you encounter several traffic lights or involve a major detour.
Avoid taking an alternate route that you haven’t planned. Just getting off a congested highway spontaneously, especially in an area you’re not familiar with, is an easy way to get lost.

, Many metropolitan areas now offer electronic tolling on major highways. This system cuts down on traffic by allowing you to pay tolls automatically without needing to stop at a tollbooth. Look up your state’s department of transportation website to sign up for this service.

, If you are able to choose which time of day to drive during the week, be sure to avoid rush hours or peak hours. Most cities’ rush hours run from 8 to 9 a.m. (08:00 to 9:00) and 5 to 6 p.m. (17:00–18:00),with less-severe congestion about one hour before and after these peak periods. High-density areas are also known to have a lunchtime rush period lasting roughly from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m (11:30 to 13:30).


If you routinely get caught in traffic during your work commute, ask your supervisor about the possibility of changing the hours when you begin and end work in order to avoid the heaviest periods of traffic.

, If you’re planning a trip or a shopping day, try scheduling it on the weekends, when traffic is substantially reduced in most metropolitan areas. Be careful, though, to find out when major weekend city festivals are taking place, since roads can fill up quickly before and after these events.

, If your can choose when to drive, wait for heavy rain or snow storms to pass before driving. Accidents and slower driving brought on by severe weather can significantly increase traffic. City traffic also tends to increase with sunny, warmer weather, so consider alternative transportation when going downtown during summer months.

Use GPS traffic tools.,
Listen to radio traffic reports.,
Check the right-hand lane.,
Watch for entrance ramps.,
Favor the curbside lane in cities.",How to Avoid Traffic2," In addition to helping you to navigate the roads, GPS systems and cell phone apps can alert you to where traffic is happening on all roads in your area. If your car has a GPS system installed, read through the help guide or user’s manual to learn how to use the traffic-information function.


Try using a cell phone app that displays up-to-the-minute traffic information, such as Google Mapsor Waze.Driving while using a cell phone is dangerous, and is illegal in many cities. Only use traffic information apps if you are a passenger in the vehicle, or when parked if you’re the driver.

, Most cities where traffic is a problem should have traffic reports available through local radio stations. In larger cities, these can be broadcast as often as every ten minutes during rush hour or peak hours. Check these reports while driving to help you decide whether to take an alternate route.


Radio traffic reports are most frequently found on AM news stations.

, During highway driving, if you notice traffic slowing down ahead of you, try changing to the right-hand lane. This lane is often more open than the other lanes in slow-moving traffic.


In countries with left-hand traffic, it should be the left-hand lane that is more open as traffic slows.
Avoid changing lanes once traffic has slowed. There will be less space to maneuver in, and accidents can occur more easily, which of course only contributes to congestion.

, If you’re driving on the highway through an area with a high number of interchanges, try to stay in the center or left-hand lanes (or right-hand lanes in countries with left-hand traffic). The right-hand lanes (or left-hand lanes in countries with left-hand traffic) can fill up quickly with vehicles entering the highway from entrance ramps. Leaving the merging lane open also allows these vehicles to enter traffic easier.


Some interchanges have entrance ramps that connect with left-hand lanes (or right-hand lanes in countries with left-hand traffic), so be alert to merging lanes opening up on the opposite side as well.

, In city streets with two lanes in each direction, try to stay in the right lane (or the left lane in countries with left-hand traffic) to avoid having to stop for cars waiting to make a left turn from the left-hand lane (or a right turn from the right-hand lane in countries with left-hand traffic).


Watch for buses in the curbside lane, since they may make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers. The non-curbside lane may be quicker in this case.
Whatever you do, make an attempt to pick a lane and stay in it, since changing lanes frequently will increase your chances for an accident.

Take advantage of rail systems.,
Try taking the bus.,
Consider riding your bike.,
Find a residence close to work.",How to Avoid Traffic3," Look at public train schedules and maps for your city to see if they cover routes serving your origin and destination. You’ll save time, spend less money on fuel and parking, and cut down on pollution. Plus, you can read, relax, or get work done during the commute.

, While not always as efficient as rail, metropolitan bus networks commonly serve broader areas, and can save you money on fuel and parking. On the highway and in city streets, buses can sometimes take advantage of bus-only lanes that bypass traffic.

, If you live fairly close to work, try going there by bicycle instead of driving. You might find that your travel time is not much different from when you were driving to and from work in traffic. Plus you’ll get some fresh air, save money on fuel, and get a good amount of exercise.

, Alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and busing will be much more practical if you can manage to live as close as possible to your place of work. But if locating close to your job isn’t an option, at least try to live near a public transportation route that connects your residence and place of work.

Locate the clutch pedal.,
Examine the pattern on the top of your stick shift.,
Start the vehicle.,
Move the stick shift into first gear.,
Lift off the clutch and slowly press on the gas pedal.",How to Upshift1," The clutch pedal should be the far left pedal in your vehicle, next to the brake. You'll have to press down on this pedal as you upshift, so it's important to know where it's located before you start driving., Familiarizing yourself with the pattern on top of your stick shift will help you understand where the stick shift needs to go when upshifting. The stick shift should have R, 1, 2, 3, 4, and sometimes higher numbers. R stands for reverse while the rest of the figures stand for the gear that your car is in. When upshifting, you'll be moving from one gear to the next highest gear to gain speed in your vehicle.Different cars will have a different shifting patterns. It's important to understand your car's pattern before you start driving.

, With the clutch pushed down to the floor, put your key into the car's ignition and rotate your wrist to start it. If you have a button ignition, press the button instead.Keeping the brake pushed down while you do this will ensure that the car doesn't roll as you shift gears.







, Move the stick shift into first gear and release the brake. As you do this the car should start to roll.








If you start the car on an incline you'll have to keep your foot on the brake to stop from rolling backward.

, Slowly lift off the clutch while simultaneously pressing down on the gas pedal. As you do this you'll start to gain momentum in first gear.









This is the hardest part of getting started, so don't worry if you stall out.
If you stall out, turn off the car and start over from the first step.

"
"
Start upshifting when your car reaches 2,500 - 3,000 RPM.,
Press down on the clutch while lifting off on the gas.,
Use your hand to shift up into the next gear.,
Lift off the clutch and press on the gas.",How to Upshift2," RPM stands for rotations per minute and tracks how fast your tires are rotating. The tachometer, or the meter that reads your car's RPM, is usually found next to your speedometer and has numbers from 0 to 9. Once the needle on this meter is between 2,500 to 3,000, you should begin to upshift.







, Use your foot to depress the clutch pedal while at the same time slowly lifting off the gas. This will free up your stick shift and allow you to slide it into the next gear. During this time your car will go into a neutral state, and you'll notice your engine revving if your foot is pressed too hard on the gas.







, Shift into the next highest gear as you're pushing the clutch down to the floor. If you're in first gear, you will move the stick shift into second gear. This should happen in one fluid motion, so don't hesitate for too long.








Practice shifting while your vehicle is off so that you get used to the pattern of the gears.

, Once you've moved up into the next gear, you can start to slowly lift off the clutch while giving your car more gas. If done correctly, the car should start to accelerate again and the RPM should go back down.








Your car won't stall when shifting higher than first gear because it's already moving.

Put the bike in neutral.,
Start the engine.,
Squeeze the clutch and push the shift lever down to first gear.,
Slowly release the clutch and walk with the bike.,
Find your balance on the bike.,
Rotate your right wrist backward on the throttle.",How to Upshift3," Put your motorcycle in neutral by squeezing the clutch lever, or the lever on the left-hand side of your handlebars. With the clutch squeezed, press down on the shift lever, or the lever at your left foot. This will put the bike in first gear. Neutral gear is one half-click up from first gear. Once the shift lever is all the way down, lightly lift up on the shift lever with your foot until you hear a click. This will put the bike in neutral.








Some motorcycles will have an indicator light that lets you know when it's in neutral.

, Press the ignition button your bike to start it. You don't need to press down on the clutch or touch anything else as you start your bike's engine.







, Compressing the clutch lever allows you to switch gears. Squeeze the lever as you push your gear shifter down, into first gear.







, As you release the clutch the bike will begin to roll forward. Start walking with the bike as you slowly release the clutch to get a feeling for the bike as it's moving.








If you stall out, turn off the bike and start over from the beginning.

, Once you get moving, lift your feet on the foot rests of the bike. Position your left foot so that your toe is under the shift lever so that you can upshift while accelerating.







, Rotating your wrist backward on the right handlebar will give the bike throttle and propel it forward. Once you let off the clutch without the bike stalling, you can practice giving the bike throttle to accelerate in first gear.








Do not give the bike too much throttle or you will send your bike flying forward.

"
Squeeze the clutch lever while reducing your throttle.,
Push up on the shift lever to put it into the next gear.,
Release the clutch while feathering the throttle.",How to Upshift4," Squeeze the left clutch lever while slowly releasing your hand on the throttle. This will allow the bike to shift up into higher gears.







, With the clutch still depressed, push up with your left toe on the shift lever. This will put the bike into the next highest gear.







, Gradually release the clutch while rotating your wrist backward on the throttle. Again, you shouldn't give the bike too much throttle, or you may lose control of it. If you did everything correctly, you will have upshifted into the next highest gear.

Pay attention when pulling out of parking lots.",How to Adjust to Driving a Car on the Left Side of the Road," Learning what type of car you are going to drive is important. If you are taking a trip where you’ll be driving on the left side of the road, then you are probably renting a car. Call the rental company ahead of time and find out if they have both manual and automatic. Even if you are used to driving stick, considering renting an automatic to make the adjustment easier.If you are only familiar with one method, it’s best to try and stick to that so you are only learning one new thing at a time.
Also consider finding out about, if possible, what specific car you will be driving (its make and model), to help you get a feel for how it will drive.
Many countries that have left-driving roads tend to have more manual cars than automatic, so you may have to pay more to rent an automatic car.;
, If you are learning to adjust to driving on the left side of the road, you are most likely in a country that you are not familiar with. Learning this new way of driving in a city with heavy traffic can add to the stress of the situation, so it is helpful whenever possible to pick up your car in a more rural location.You may have to pick a different rental company, or see if they will deliver the car to wherever you are. The benefit of this is that you will have more open roads to get used to rather than densely packed cities with tight streets.
If you can’t pick it up a distance outside the city, see if you can pick it up close to the edge rather than the middle, so that way you can head out of the city immediately.

, Once you are in the driver’s seat, you should take some time to get acquainted with the setup up and functions of the car. The shifter is going to be on your left side now instead of the right side. The turn signals, windshield wipers, and headlight controls may be on the opposite side of the steering wheel as they were before. Testing these controls before you drive is absolutely necessary.Even in cars with the driver’s seat on the right side of the car, the brake and accelerator are in the same position as left side driver’s seat cars. Still, your right leg will be against the door rather than against the middle console or in the open. Get used to the feel of having your right leg against the door.

, Roundabouts are a frequent part of driving in European countries that use left-lane driving. You’ll still see some traffic lights, but you already know how to handle those. Roundabouts may be a bit more challenging, even if you have driven them in your home country. The added difficulty of the driving on the left can make them a little more daunting. Roundabouts are designed to be safer than traffic lights and they allow traffic to keep slowing rather than stop completely.Always yield to those people already driving in the roundabout. They have the right of way.
You have to pick the lane you want to use and stay in that lane until you exit the roundabout. Look for signs before entering the roundabout that direct which lane you should use, if the roundabout has multiple lanes. The lane more to the right is essentially for those who are making a right turn. The left lane, then, is for those who are using one of the three or more other roadways.
The main thing to remember at first is just to slow down and be cautious until you get the hang of the roundabout. Try to watch the other traffic and mimic what they are doing.

, On roads with one two lanes, one going in each direction, you always want to pay attention to how wide the roadway is and stay close to the outside. Sometimes you may have to inch off the road a little to allow other cars to pass you.This can be especially tricky on streets that have cars parked on the sides. Sometimes you will need to pull off to the side and stop and let a car from the opposite direction go past first. Likewise, locals will often let you go past as well.

, Some countries have local customs that can include breaking traffic laws. Red lights may be discretionary, and if a driver sees that no one is coming they may pass through the red light anyway. You still want to know the laws, but you can begin to adapt to the local practices by paying attention. Still, you are the only one who has your safety and best interest in mind, so being over-cautious and defensive while you drive is probably still best., When you are learning to do almost anything, slowing down is usually pretty helpful, and this is definitely true when adjusting to a new way of driving. Since you will be looking at the road from a new vantage point, it’s possible that your reaction time will be a little slower than it was before. If you are driving fast, then this will only make your slow reactions seem worse.


Don’t be afraid to go slower while you get the feel of this new way of driving. People may get up close behind you, so it’s not a bad idea every so often to pull off to the side and let those people go past you. It is better to have a few people angry at you and to take more time on your drive than to go faster than you can handle and cause an accident.

, A lot of drivers tend to get in the groove of driving and often let themselves multitask or pay attention to more than the road while they drive. You may be used to adjusting the stereo system, looking at your phone to text or navigate, reaching behind you to find something in the back seat, or eating a quick lunch on your commute. Don’t do all that. Focus on the road.Consider whether or not you think you might need to do these things and specifically do them before you get going.
It can also be a good idea to forego listening to music at all on your first driving trip.

, You most likely don’t know the roads when you are starting to drive on the left side, so it can be really helpful to learn the basics of the drive you are about to make.Before you start your drive, study the map and try to have a good idea of where you are going. If it is possible to set audio navigation on either your phone, the car itself, or a gps system, this is a good idea. Having the route clearly defined will free you up to focus only on driving.

, If at all possible when learning to drive on the left, it is good to have another passenger along for the ride who can help you remember to stay on the left side of the road. They can also watch the center line and help you make sure you are not drifting too close to or completely over it. They can also act as navigator and help you watch for signs and other drivers. Obviously this will not always be possible, but it’s a great help if you can manage it.


Having someone else with is also really helpful when you go to park for the first time. You may very well have to parallel park, which tends to be easier if you have someone who can guide you.
Plus, if you are particularly nervous about making this driving adjustment, having someone to talk to and keep you calm will be invaluable.

, If you are used to driving on the right side of the road, then pulling right out of a parking lot means pulling into the lane that is closest to you. On roadways where you drive on the left, now pulling out to the right means you are crossing oncoming traffic. Make sure you check to your right (the oncoming lane) before pulling out into the left lane.This also means that pulling out left means you will pull into the left lane closest to you, assuming the road only has two lanes. This will feel unsettling at first, so just take an extra breath and an extra look to remind yourself what you are doing.
When you are getting used to this, deliberately look at the roadway a couple extra times to firmly remind yourself where you are at in traffic and whether or not you are crossing oncoming traffic to get to your lane.

Ensure that the vehicle is correctly insured.,
Remember that the supervising driver is legally the main driver of the vehicle.,
Agree boundaries with the learner driver before setting off.,
Double-check everything during driving.,
Make sure all instructions are clear and precise.,
Do not teach bad habits.,
Remember to observe the speed limit and monitor vehicle speed regularly.,
Remain as calm as possible at all times.,
Positive feedback is equally as important as negative feedback.,
If an accident does occur, stay composed.",How to Accompany a Learner Driver (UK)," It is paramount that the learner driver is insured correctly on the vehicle as a Provisional Licence Holder, or the insurance company is not obliged to pay out in the case of an accident. It may also be prudent for you (as the supervising driver) to be insured also, allowing you to take control should the learner driver be unable to continue driving.;
, This means that all road laws also apply to you, even if you are not driving yourself. In the United Kingdom, the supervising driver MUST be over 21 years old and have held a Full UK Driving Licence for over 3 years. You should not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs when accompanying a learner driver, and you must not operate a mobile phone or other electronic device.

, This includes the length of time of driving and that the learner driver is prepared to accept your instructions and criticism. If you are in doubt as to whether these boundaries will be respected or obeyed, then do not agree to supervise.

, A learner driver is not equipped with the same driving experience as you, and does not know how to read the road and traffic conditions as effectively. You should remain alert at all times, monitoring not only the driving but also the surrounding environment. Where possible, look in the mirrors often and ensure that you know about vehicles behind as well as in front. Provide guidance at junctions and roundabouts as to when it is safe to proceed, or when it is safe to change lanes or overtake where necessary.

, Make sure that you are familiar with the roads that you are supervising on, and provide clear guidance throughout the drive. Vague or confusing instructions can be frustrating and off-putting to an inexperienced driver.

, A learner driver will not drive in the same way as an experienced driver would. This is normal, as a learner driver is specifically taught techniques that will help them to pass the driving test. Do not attempt to un-teach these techniques or replace them with more casual or bad habits, as this will confuse a new driver and undermine their driving test readiness.

, Your judgement on speed for the given road or conditions is very important. If you feel that the driver should change their speed to match conditions, tell them.

, You should avoid becoming agitated, frustrated or argumentative whilst supervising a learner driver. Arguments can frequently cause car accidents, and can be very off-putting to the driver of the vehicle. Try to keep criticism friendly wherever possible.

, Make sure to also comment on things that the learner driver has done well. When evaluating with the driver, mention positive points before negative ones as this can help to reinforce things that have been done well or correctly. Do not make criticism personal - driving is a complicated art that takes time to master correctly.

, Unfortunately, accidents do happen, and sometimes they are simply not preventable.

, Parking along the curb, with the exception of loading zones, or for loading a heavy item or helping a less mobile individual with their load is annoying and often dangerous.

, The drivers in the cars behind you may be finished with their errands, and are ready to head for work or home. If the person is already pulling out, that's one thing. But if you're sitting there while they walk to the car, waiting while they put their bags in the car, etc. you'll be trying the patience of every other car behind you, especially if they can't go around you.

, Overhanging the stripes will tend to crowd the driver who parks in the adjacent space, and frequently leads to door dings in the paint of cars.


Know how to Park a Truck or Large Vehicle neatly if you have one, or if your vehicle is large in relation to your local parking spaces because they are too small.







, This makes it easier for other drivers to see past your car when they are backing out of adjacent spaces, and also gives the widest possible driving lane between spaces. This can be particularly helpful when shoppers pushing loaded carts are sharing the driving lane with moving vehicles. The exception would be a very small compact or sub-compact vehicle. With small cars such as a Mini Cooper or Smart, parking so that the back end of your car is equal with the cars beside you lets drivers know that the space is occupied and does not give the false impression that the parking spot is vacant.

, do not pull so far forward that your car cannot be seen as a person drives down the lane, looking for a spot. Pull into the spot, out of the lane of traffic, but not so far that your car is unable to be seen from the lane. You may be saving yourself damage from someone who sees the ""open"" space and pulls in a BIT too quickly.

, In crowded, busy parking lots, special compact car spaces are becoming more common. Standard parking spaces are generally 9 feet (2.7 m) wide while compact car spaces are only 7 feet (2.1 m) wide. Obviously, a large SUV or Pickup will not fit easily in a compact car space, and quite simply put, they are not supposed to.

, Small cars parked between larger vehicles like vans and SUVs often have to back blindly out of their spaces, so be alert and give them a break. If you are walking past a car in this situation, pause for a moment and guide the driver out of the tight spot if you are able.

, You are not likely to be pulled over by the police, but there are laws regarding operating a motor vehicle in a public parking lot, just as there are on the highway. Here are some things to watch for.

Posted speed limits. Many large parking lots do have posted speed limits, these are for the safety of pedestrians and other drivers, please note and obey them.






One Way signs and markings. In parking lots with diagonal spaces, individual lanes may be one way, most often marked with a directional arrow painted on the pavement at the end of each lane. Even if the lane is not marked, you may be safe to assume the lane is one way if the diagonal spaces are oriented in the same direction on both sides.






Stop and Yield signs. These serve the same purpose in parking lots they serve on city streets, allowing the right-of-way to a vehicle driving in a certain lane or direction, and should be obeyed.






Handicapped and elderly spaces. Handicapped parking spaces are generally clearly marked with signs and special striping, and are wider than regular spaces to accommodate wheel chairs. They are located near disabled ramps, usually very close to the business's entrance. If you do not require the use of these spaces, and do not have a permit, park somewhere else.






Pedestrian crosswalks. These are common near the main entrances and exits of most large businesses, for the safety of pedestrians returning to their cars. They are usually marked with diagonal white or yellow stripes, and often also are marked with a pedestrian crossing or stop sign.






Turn signals. Using turn signals gives other drivers an idea what your intentions are, use them in a timely manner to indicate what you are doing.







, These receivers, usually made of heavy steel and often with sharp corners, can be dangerous to inattentive pedestrians trying to walk as close to parked vehicles as possible to give drivers more room.

, This is very important where landscaped areas are within the curb boundaries, since jumping the curb may damage plants and irrigation components.

, Driving at highway, or even street speeds, in a parking lot filled with puddles of rainwater can inundate a passing pedestrian, or even another driver who is traveling with their window down. It also makes it harder to stop quickly if a child should run out or a wayward cart start rolling across your path.

, You may feel like they were discourteous, but showing grace, rather than anger, shows more class and prevents reciprocal aggression. See How to Release Anger and How to Respond to a Road Raged Driver.

,, Not only is it dangerous in busy parking lots, but a loaded shopping cart in a hilly parking lot can end up crashing into and damaging someone's vehicle. Children should also not be allowed to ride the cart back to the vehicle, with the exception of small toddlers or infants riding in the special seat built into many shopping carts, while a parent has both hands on the handle.

, This will help protect them from inattentive drivers, and make the parking lot safer for everyone.

, For example, there are often employee lots reserved for certain employees or for those who have served a set length of employment as a reward. Know about these cordoned off parks before selecting a spot in which to leave your vehicle for the business day., This includes speed, distance, and size of parking space before pulling your vehicle into the selected spot. Be aware that in many business parking lots, parking is not the only activity, but there may be a lot of loads being unloaded and packed, in tall vehicles, that can make it more congested and difficult to see your way clear. This makes it even more important to be very careful and follow the parking lot instructions, for your own safety and for the safety of other workers., Going the wrong way causes accidents, while parking in no parking zones can impact loading and packing operations. It may also mean that your car registration is called out over the intercom and you have to sheepishly leave a meeting to move your car.

For parking lots with two entrances/exits, one is usually the entrance and one is the exit. Pay close attention to this, as various lots will have selected parking spots along the entrance. When parking in these spots, pull all the way in, with the direction of traffic.

, Nobody likes to see trash blowing around the parking lot as they walk to and from the business, so stow the empty fast food wrappers, ashtray contents, drink bottles, and other potential debris until you have access to a waste receptacle. This should also apply to sales fliers and business literature, including that which is conveniently posted underneath windshield wiper blades while you are searching for your latest bargain.

, Many large stores have cart corrals for shopping carts when the customer is finished unloading them. Putting the carts in these locations will make it less likely the cart you were using will end up denting someone else's car.

, This will save time as well as money. You may even be able to save even more money by becoming a one-car family.

, If you can do several short trips in one longer trip, you will save fuel and time. Internet map programs such as Google Maps and certain GPS devices allow convenient or even automated re-ordering of destinations to save distance and time. Make lists to avoid having to go back. Call ahead to avoid wasted trips.

, For example, designate Wednesday afternoon as errand day, and make sure family members know that this is the day for grocery shopping, post office visits, and other nearby outings.

, Some of your stops may be near each other. Park between some or all of them and walk.

, If you wander all over the parking lot looking for that really close parking space, you'll use more gas. Don't be afraid to walk from the far end of the parking lot if it comes to that, the walk will do you good!

, Organize it with the equipment needed for common outing types such as a picnic (for instance, blanket, small cooler perhaps collapsible, cheap camera, etc) to avoid unnecessary trips home; a FEW extra pounds in a several-thousand-pounds car will consume much less fuel than a few unnecessary trips home, and no time. Consider keeping simple equipment for carrying oversized items (at least a bungee to close the trunk over a slightly oversized item) on hand, but be sure to know how to use that safely.

Drive at a distance from the car in front of you to avoid unnecessary acceleration and frequent repetitive braking that ends up wasting fuel and ruining brakes. It’s much safer too!

, An engine runs most efficiently between 1,500 and 2,500 rpm (lower in diesels). To maintain these low revs, change up through the gears as soon as practical and before the revs reach 2,500 rpm. Automatic transmissions will shift up more quickly and smoothly if you ease back slightly on the accelerator once the car speeds up.

, This tip saves fuel...and lives. High speeds equal high fuel consumption. At 110 km/h (68 mph) your car uses up to 25% more fuel than it would at 90 km/h (56 mph)., Avoid fast starts after stop lights (it’s not a drag race). Don’t weave in and out of traffic like you’re playing Grand Theft Auto. Accelerating unnecessarily and braking hard does not really save you much time. What it does do is use more fuel and increase wear and tear on car parts such as your tires and brake pads.

, Under-inflated tires increase rolling resistance, use more gas and wear more rapidly. Keeping tires inflated to the maximum recommended pressure (printed in the owner’s manual) can reduce fuel use by 3-4% and extend tire life.Make sure your wheels are properly aligned to reduce fuel consumption, extend tire life and improve handling. Rotating tires at designated intervals will keep them wearing evenly and lasting longer. According to Consumer Reports, a tire’s rolling resistance “can add or detract an additional 1-2 miles per gallon.”.

, Modern engines do not need to be warmed up. Idling for more than 30 seconds creates excess emissions and wastes fuel. Stop the engine whenever your car is stopped or held up for a longer period of time. By switching the engine off, even for a few minutes, you will save more fuel than is lost from the burst of fuel involved in restarting the engine. Note: Increased wear and tear from doing this is negligible., Lighter cars get better fuel economy. Piling things on top of your car reduces aerodynamics and fuel economy by up to 5%.Avoid using a roof rack regularly because it alters the vehicle's center of gravity and dramatically changes it’s driving dynamics. Note: The more a vehicle carries the more fuel it uses. An extra 110 lb (50 kg) carried can increase your fuel bill by 2%. So...remove the sandbags and out of season sports gear from the trunk. Keep the spare tire and emergency kit!

, Open windows decrease a vehicle’s aerodynamics on highways, which lowers its fuel economy. Additional parts on the exterior of a vehicle such as roof racks and spoilers, or simply having the windows open, increases air resistance and fuel consumption by up to 20%. Note: Operating air conditioners can use up to 10% extra fuel. Yet, at speeds of more than 80 km/h (50 mph), using the air conditioning is better for fuel consumption than even a single open window., Sun reflectors keep cabin temperature down while a vehicle is parked, easing the load on the AC when you get back. Reflecting the sun can be good for your health!

, A clean-running engine will not only use less fuel, but will pump fewer emissions out the tailpipe. Maintain regular tune-ups and oil changes for your car. A properly tuned-up engine always runs more efficiently and wastes less fuel.

,, Always use oils matching the viscosity grade recommended in the vehicle's manual. Stick to popular brands, despite the cost, because the not doing so could cost you a lot more in the long run.

, After adding a car conversion kit AKA beefed-up battery pack and some extra computing power, a Prius or Escape Hybrid can be plugged into a home socket. They will run on electric power alone for up to 40 miles (64 kilometres) once fully charged. This is more than enough for the average work commute.

, Run as many errands as possible in a single car trip to save both time and fuel. The engine is cold for the first couple of minutes of every car trip, so it uses more gas for those miles. Don’t waste gas driving to stores that are closed, or getting lost. Map out routes before you go or use a GPS system and check hours online.

, The ultimate green car upgrade may just be no car at all, or, rather, not driving everywhere by default. If you want to try going without a car completely, car-sharing companies like Zipcar let you use a car only when you need one. Users can pay by the month, sign up online, swipe their card and simply drive away. Gas, insurance and air fresheners included.

Join a loyalty club.,
Check the web for deals.,
Buy gas on Wednesday.,
Buy gas three days before a holiday.",How to Find Good Gas Prices," Buy where you can get the best deal. There isn't any significant difference between any of the regular gas brands. In fact, all the brands fill their tanker trucks at whatever refinery is closest and the only difference between ""brands"" is a few gallons of a proprietary additive package that gets mixed with the fuel after it is loaded. All additives must meet OEM and EPA performance standards so the only real difference between brands is the audacity of the superior performance claims.;
, Low-octane ""regular"" gas is usually all that is required. Octane is only a rating of the fuel's resistance to engine-damaging pre-ignition (""knock"") in high-performance engines (that few people have). Low octane gas is less expensive and a better value if that's all your engine requires. Check your owner's manual to be sure. Modern high-performance cars will sometimes recommend higher octane fuels because they are engineered to use those fuels.


Remember that engines need less octane at higher altitudes. If your engine does not ""knock"" on regular, paying more for a higher octane rating is a waste since the increased octane makes no significant improvement to gas mileage and it is no better for your engine.

, This works in much the same way that some credit card companies allow you to earn frequent flier miles when you use their card for purchases. For example, BMO-Shell cash back Master Card offers 3% cash back of your purchase gas and any commodity from Shell stores and 1% cash back for any purchase from any store. In addition, by giving $45.00 annual fees you will get basic road site assistance. More than this $45.00 you can earn from cash back. Furthermore, Shell also gives Air Miles in addition to above.

, Some gas stations, department stores and grocery stores offer lower prices when you present their membership card. Keep your eyes open and verify that their prices are really lower than other stations in your neighborhood.

, With the ever increasing gas prices, use the Internet to find the cheapest gas near you. Some of these sites even offer text messaging capabilities, where they will send you the a text message with the location of the cheapest gas in your area. But don't drive miles out of your way or wait in excessively long lines (your car gets 0 MPG while stopped and idling.) just for a cheaper station, or you will defeat the purpose.

, Gas prices are statistically the cheapest on Wednesdays, but this is only statistically true over a large number of days. It won't be true every week.

, Gas prices almost always go up for holidays.

Set the car tires to the proper inflation.,
Tune up the engine.,
Check the condition of your engine air filter.,
Replace the fuel filter according to the car manufacturer's recommended schedule.,
Lighten your load.,
Select the narrowest possible tires for your vehicle that will satisfy your driving style and demands.,
Select low-rolling-resistance compound tires.,
Make sure the oxygen sensors, engine emissions system, and evaporative emissions control systems are in good shape on fuel-injected cars.",How to Increase Fuel Mileage on a Car1," Properly inflated tires can reduce fuel consumption by up to 3%. Your tires also lose about 1 PSI per month, and when the tires are cold (e.g., in the winter), their pressure will decrease due to the thermal contraction of the air. It is recommended to check tires at least monthly, preferably weekly. Having properly inflated tires will also help you avoid uneven wear on the tread.


Some fuel stations have automatic air compressors that stop at a predetermined level. (For safety, double-check pressure with your own gauge, especially if another is suggesting you add a surprisingly large amount of air.)
Small permanently-installed valve-stem extensions can allow filling without removing the caps, but check that they are not prone to jamming with foreign matter and leaking.
Recommended inflation pressures are for cold tires; it is best to inflate first thing in the morning or you've driven less than two miles so your reading will be accurate. If you have been driving around for a while or it is hot outside, add 3 PSI. Inflate to the pressure recommended by your car's manual or the sticker on your driver-side doorpost. Be aware that the reading stamped on the tire is the maximum tire pressure, not the recommended.;
, A properly tuned engine maximizes power and can greatly enhance fuel efficiency. Beware, though, that many tuners will disable efficiency measures when tuning for power.


Be sure you are keeping good spark plugs in the engine, changing the oil on time, making sure the air filter is clean, etc.

, A dirty filter will reduce fuel economy, or make the engine stall when idling. Just like mowing dusty grass, driving dusty dirt roads will clog the air filter: avoid dust clouds.

, This will go a long way to enhancing fuel efficiency.

, Get the lightest car that will serve your needs. Weight is one of the biggest causes for loss of kinetic energy in non-hybrid cars. If you're not shopping for cars, then take any extra weight off of the one you're already driving. If seats that you don't use can be removed, take them out. If you use your trunk as a storage space for heavy things, find another place for them. An extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 1–2%. (Weight is most important in stop-and-go driving. In almost exclusively highway driving, it matters little: once the car is up to speed, it need only push air out of the way.) Don't remove things from the car that you need frequently; instead, make sure these are in the car and readily accessible because wasted trips to retrieve or replace them will be much worse than a little lower mileage.

, Narrow tires have less frontal area, thus reducing aerodynamic drag. Remember, however, that narrow tires have less traction as well (which is why race cars have such wide tires). Do not get a tire that is incompatible with your wheels (use the size tires that came stock on the vehicle), and do not get smaller wheels unless your manufacturer approves.

, These can increase fuel economy by a few percent. However, the difference is not startling or a substitute for proper inflation. It would be wasteful to replace the former tires with these before they are worn out.

, Often the ""check engine light"" coming on is an indication that there is a problem with one of these components. A damaged oxygen sensor may cause your car to have too rich of a fuel mixture, decreasing your fuel mileage by 20% or more.

When you fill up with gas, fill up halfway and try to keep your tank above one quarter full.,
Add a synthetic oil additive to either natural or synthetic oil when getting your oil changed.,
Buy quality fuel.,
Try to avoid using the air conditioner in stop-and-go city driving as it causes the engine to work hard and consume more fuel.,
If you're trying to find a direct way to control the amount of gas you are using, monitor how hard your engine is working is key.",How to Increase Fuel Mileage on a Car2," If your fuel runs low,you could put stress on the fuel pump. However, 10 gallons (37.9 L) of gas adds 60 pounds of weight. A half-full tank may increase your mileage.

, This can increase your gas mileage by up to 15% if you follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommended usage. Be aware that the usefulness of this is questionable: it may be unlikely that synthetic-oil ""additive"" would cause a car to work much less hard; it would not make the oil overall much less viscous, and circulating the oil is only a relatively small task for a car engine.

, No two fuels are the same, and while ""discount"" brand fuel may save you a few cents per L or Gal, it can contain a higher percentage of ethanol, which burns at a faster rate. Compare the mileage between fuel companies and see what is best for your car.

, However, studies show that at highway speeds cars get somewhat better mileage with the AC on and the windows rolled up. The drag caused by rolled down windows at high speed reduces fuel efficiency more than the AC.

, A/C, acceleration, and speed all, of course, affect work but these are not direct indicators. Try monitoring the R.P.M.s (or revolutions per minute) your engine is running at. It's like monitoring your pulse to find out how hard your heart is working You will find that there are RPM ranges which are ideal for your car and others that are not.


If you find the engine is running at above 3000 R.P.M.s, it's possible you're accelerating at an unnecessarily a low gear. So, ease off the pedal and let the engine build up a higher speed at a lower RPM. he lower average RPM you travel the lower your work and this directly determines your gas mileage.
How do you monitor your RPM? Most cars have a left gauge next to the speedometer called the tachometer. It measures your RPM at x1000 which means if your gauge indicates halfway between 2 & 3, you're running at 2,500 RPM. A comfort/efficient RPM zone is between 2,000 and 3,000 RPM; however, try to stay below 2,000 as much as possible and not much over 2,700 unless necessary, such as when you are moving uphill through a traffic light from a stopped position. This means you won't get above 40 mph (64 km/h) and you'll achieve 50–55 mph (80–89 km/h) in the city and up to 65 mph (105 km/h) on the highway and still be running at 2,500 RPM. Try to find your comfort/efficient zone and perhaps you can get a few more M.P.G.s by watching how hard your engine is working!
Be aware that some vehicles are monitored by x100.

Use cruise control.,
Slow down.,
Accelerate smoothly with moderate throttle.,
Avoid braking wherever possible.,
Avoid excessive idling.,
Find your car's ""sweet speed"".,
Make sure you enable overdrive if your car has an automatic transmission with overdrive, except when towing very heavy trailers.,
Don't circle in a parking lot, and keep well away from the store fronts.,
Maintain a safe following distance.,
Avoid turning across oncoming traffic.",How to Increase Fuel Mileage on a Car3," In most situations, using your cruise control reduces fuel consumption by maintaining a constant speed.

, The faster you move, the harder your engine has to work to push through the air. Speeding can reduce fuel efficiency by up to 33%. (Factors other than air resistance decrease fuel economy below about 60 mph (97 km/h), so fuel economy is not a reason to go slower, but fuel economy decreases rapidly above that speed).

, Engines are most efficient with moderately high air flow (throttle) and at revolutions per minute (RPM)s up to their power peak (for small to mid sized engines this is generally somewhere between 4k to 5k RPM). In a manual transmission car, practice 'short shifting', or shifting to higher gears as soon as you reach your desired speed by skipping intermediate gears. For example, accelerate to 40 mph (64 km/h) using 1st gear and 2nd gear, then shift directly to 4th (skipping 3rd), or if your engine can maintain your speed, to 5th. (Be aware that if you have to floor the accelerator pedal in 5th to maintain your speed, you should be in 4th!)

, Braking wastes energy from fuel that you have already burned, and accelerating after braking consumes more fuel than driving at a constant speed. On city streets watch ahead and coast when you see a red light or traffic jam ahead.

, Idling a vehicle wastes a significant amount of fuel. The best way to warm up a vehicle is to drive it slowly until it reaches proper operating temperature. However, in very cold weather it is still advisable to let the engine idle for about a minute or two before driving.

, Some cars get better mileage at specific speeds, usually 50 mph (80 km/h). Your car's ""sweet speed"" is the minimum speed at which the car is running in its highest gear (watch for rpm drops as you accelerate to determine when your transmission is shifting into higher gears). For example, most Jeep Cherokees are best at 55 mph (89 km/h), and Toyota 4Runners are best at about 50 mph (80 km/h). Find your vehicle's ""sweet speed"" and pick your roads accordingly.

, Overdrive is by default enabled on the ""D"" on most shifters. Several cars have buttons on the shifter which allow you to turn off the overdrive gear. Don't turn it off except in specific circumstances it may be needed such as for engine braking downhill or failure to proceed uphill smoothly in overdrive. Overdrive saves you gas mileage at higher speeds by using a higher gear in the transmission. For example, for every ¾ of a turn of the engine going into the transmission, the output of the trans is one.

, Look for a spot in the empty half of the parking lot. Many people spend significant time idling and creeping, waiting for a ""close spot"" to open up.

, Don't stick to the bumper of the car directly in front of you. You will brake more and accelerate more to keep that unnecessary and dangerously narrow gap. Relax. Hang back a bit. This also gives you a lot more room to play with when you are timing lights. When the driver ahead of you slams on his brakes, you can coast down and see if the light quick-changes green again (some do). You might even coast by his car as the light turns green and he has to accelerate from a dead stop.

, If your route will allow it, try to make as few left turns as possible on the way to your destination (or right turns in countries with left-hand traffic). Stopping and waiting at an intersection to make a turn across the oncoming lane lets the engine run idle, which wastes gas, as does accelerating once again to make the turn."
"
Plan your trips.,
Plan your route carefully.,
Maintain a log over time of how many miles you go (the main odometer) and how much gas you put in (from the gas pump, including fractions).",How to Increase Fuel Mileage on a Car4," Keep lists of needs that will require a trip and try to accomplish multiple objectives with each. This will not increase your fuel mileage (the number of miles your car moves for each gallon of gas), but it will help you drive less (which, in turn, means you use less gas).

, Take the route with the fewest stops and turns and least traffic. Take highways in preference to city streets when possible.

, Put it in a spreadsheet. It will keep you focused, and other methods are inaccurate; you will never know for sure if you're saving fuel, wasting fuel or just seeing errors from gas pumps that stop pumping at different points, or fractions of miles being dropped off your 'trip' odometer when you reset it.

Use common sense in your driving habits to reap immediate reductions in fuel consumption, wear and tear on your vehicle, tires and brakes, thus expense.,
Maintain your vehicle.,
Consider having pure synthetic lubricants installed in your vehicle.",How to Improve Your Gas Mileage and Save Money,"


Accelerate smoothly and gently when leaving intersections and stop signs. It is inconsiderate of other drivers and even contributes to congestion at intersections, to dawdle once the light turns green. But it isn't necessary to hit the gas with a heavy foot either. The harder your engine has to work, the more gas you burn.
Paying attention to traffic avoids the necessity for sudden acceleration, turns and braking. Be aware of what is ahead, behind and around you. It is not only safer to maintain an appropriate distance between you and cars ahead, but it allows you to maintain a more constant speed. Repetitive acceleration and braking uses more gas and increases brake wear.
Avoid sharp turning. Execute a proper arch when making turns. Many intersections are laid out with turning arches. Following a good arch reduces wear on tires, suspension and brakes, as well as reducing fuel consumption. You will also discover that you actually clear the intersection quicker and more comfortably than those who drive to the ""post,"" then have to make a hard turn to straighten out and proceed.;
, It is less expensive to keep your car in good shape than it is to pay for a major repair.


Ensure that your tire pressure is kept up. Proper air pressure in your tires reduces resistance to rolling. It is not only safer and improves handling, but reduces fuel consumption and tire wear.
Today's cars don't require tune-ups nearly as often as they once did, but they still need regular care and inspection. Even newer vehicles have time/mileage limited parts that require adjustment or replacement at some point. Having a professional mechanic servicing your vehicle can catch damage and spot leaks or wear early, thereby preventing further damage, accelerated wear and expense.
Oil, oil filter and air filter maintenance are imperative to preserving engine life. At a minimum, adhere to the manufacturer's schedule. Clean air entering the engine is as important as clean oil. Oil and oil filtration cannot prevent damage caused by sand and other destructive particles that enter the cylinders from the top.
Don't forget about your fuel system. Fuel injectors can form deposits at the nozzles and will require cleaning. This has a direct affect on fuel economy and performance. Regular maintenance as mentioned above would include fuel system maintenance, but it bears specific mention.

, There are several good reasons to move to this technology. This can save you money on oil changes and maintenance. Keep in mind that ester-based lubricants were developed for turbine engines because petroleum oils simply couldn't do the job.


Pure synthetic lubricants make possible extended drain intervals that traditional petroleum oils can't sustain. Most petroleum oils are expected to maintain their efficiency for 3,000 miles (4,828 km.) or approximately 3 months. Pure synthetic lubricants can provide from 7,000 miles (11,265 km.), and up to 35,000 miles (56,327 km.) and 1 year service life, depending on the specific oil.
Synthetic lubricants provide superior lubricating qualities: reducing friction, more efficient cooling and cleaning. This translates into reduced wear of all wetted components, extended service life and reduced maintenance and repair costs. These optimum lubricating qualities and benefits also apply to transmission and gear lubricants.
Extended drain intervals result in fewer oil changes per year, saving you money. Of course pure synthetics cost more. But over the course of a year, you save a significant amount.
Extended drain intervals also result in reducing the amount of waste oil per year. So, changing over to pure synthetic lubricants saves you money in oil changes, reduces waste oil and provides superior protection and performance�including better fuel economy.

, This article includes ideas such as carpooling, combining trips and taking the first parking spot you find.








, This article offers tips about making sure you are paying a competitive price for the gas you do buy. Be sure to recognize the value of the gas you spend to go out of your way.








, A properly maintained vehicle will run more efficiently and give you better mileage, which saves you money in gas.








, This involves three things:









Consider whether to fill your tank up full or halfway. Filling up your tank halfway will reduce your car's weight, increasing your mileage slightly. However, if your nearest gas station is significantly out of the way of your daily route, make sure to take into account the gas spent driving to the station and the value of your time.
Don't top up your tank between fills. It is wasted money and bad for the environment because it invariably forces liquid fuel into the evaporative emissions system, where it overwhelms circuits that route fuel tank vapors to the engine.Wait until you have a quarter tank, but don't push this any further. Doing this can extend your gas mileage because you are hauling a lighter fuel load. It also gives you the opportunity to buy more gas if you run across a bargain. However, in cold weather, you run an increased risk of condensation in the fuel tank. Running a car with less than a quarter tank can shorten the life of the electric fuel pump, and running on empty will often destroy the pump.

, This is best done when the tires are cold (have not been driven on more than a mile or so). It is proper for them to have a few psi higher pressure after extensive driving, but filling them hot should generally be avoided unless they are very low on air to avoid inaccuracy. Excessive pressure adds very little efficiency and can cause bad handling and uneven tire wear. Some gas stations, notably Sheetz gas stations, have air pumps that are free to use and automatically inflate the tires to a pressure set on the pump. These are very convenient. (If an automatic pump seems to be adding an unexpectedly large amount of air, double-check its progress with a hand air gauge to avoid overfilling.)

In California, gas station operators are required to offer free air to customers who purchase fuel.

Getting a diesel car also allows for use of bio-diesel or even waste vegetable oil (WVO/SVO) fuel. Though diesel pricing can vary widely from traditional petrol.






;
, Not only do hybrids give you immediate savings at the pump, the U.S. government and your local state offer tax breaks for people who use gas-saving cars. Federal deductions for using gas-saving cars can be as high as $2,000, but check before buying to see if they're still in effect. Also, check with your insurance company because Hybrids have higher insurance rates.








, Generally speaking, smaller cars are lighter and get better mileage.








, Many engines produce maximum torque at a rarely used RPM. An engine that produces maximum torque in the range of 2200 to 3000 RPM will yield usable power. An engine operating at its torque peak will be more efficient.








, They are cheaper and often get 70 MPG or more. Riding gear is available for most weather conditions. A good example is the Kawasaki EX250, which costs about $3,000, gets 60-70 MPG at highway speeds, and can go 0–60 mph (96.6 km/h) in under 6 seconds!

Avoid idling.,
Plan your trips in advance.,
Use a global positioning system (GPS) to navigate and find the fastest and shortest distance to your destination.,
Drive at a consistent speed.,
Avoid using cruise control when driving on hilly highway roads.,
Avoid stops.,
Anticipate the stop signs and lights.,
Maintain a safe following distance.,
Slow down.,
Take off slowly from a full stop.,
Stay well away from store fronts where you will spend significantly more time idling and waiting for pedestrians and other vehicles.








,
Use A







,
Shift into neutral if you are not comfortable with downshifting.,
Park in the shade.",How to Save Money on Gas3," While idling, your car gets exactly 0 mile per gallon while starting the car uses the same amount as idling for 6 seconds. Park your car and go into the restaurant rather than idling in the drive-through. Idling with the air conditioning on also uses extra fuel. Also, avoid going so fast that you have to brake for someone. Whenever you brake, you waste the gas it took to get going that fast.








, This can prevent wasting fuel and wasting time. Plan to use alternative routes. Often, back roads can prevent you from stopping at traffic lights and more importantly sitting in traffic jams. Try to schedule your trips and errands when traffic is lighter.








, Avoiding hills and stops will increase your gas mileage.








, Avoid quick acceleration and hard braking. Cruise control will keep you at a constant speed, even when going up and down hills.








, The cruise control will keep you at a constant speed, which means it will not anticipate a coming hill and accelerate to meet it. It will make the car idle downhill and then flaw it for the uphill sections. It is far more efficient to turn it off on these roads and maintain the flexibility of normal driving.








, If approaching a red light, see if you can slow down enough to avoid having to actually stop (because you reach the light after it is green). Speeding up from 5 or 10 mph (8.0 or 16.1 km/h) will be easier on the gas than starting from full stop.








, Look far ahead; get to know your usual routes. You can let up on the gas earlier. Coasting to a stop will save the gasoline you would otherwise use maintaining your speed longer. If it just gets you to the end of a line of cars at a red light or a stop sign a few seconds later, it won't add any time to your trip. Ditto for coasting to lose speed before a highway off-ramp: if it means you catch up with that truck halfway around the curve instead of at the beginning, you haven't lost any time. In many cities, if you know the streets well, you can time the lights and maintain the appropriate speed to hit all green lights. Usually this is about 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h).








, Don't stick to the bumper of the car directly in front of you. You will brake more and accelerate more to keep that unnecessary and dangerous narrow gap. This also gives you a lot more room to play with when you are timing traffic signals. Likewise, ignore tailgaters. They will tailgate you whether you go the speed limit, or 100 mph (160 km/h) over the speed limit. Allow them pass when it's convenient.








, Air resistance goes up as the square of velocity. The power consumed to overcome that air resistance goes up as the cube of the velocity. Rolling resistance is the dominant force below about 40 mph (64 km/h). Above that, every mph costs you mileage. Go as slow as traffic and your schedule will allow. Drive under 60-65 since air grows exponentially denser, in the aerodynamic sense, the faster we drive. To be precise, the most efficient speed is your car's minimum speed in it's highest gear, since this provides the best ""speed per RPM"" ratio. This is usually about 45 to 55 mph (72 to 89 km/h).








, This is one adjustment that will have dramatic effects on your gas mileage; don't tear off from a stoplight or stop sign!








,,, Standard transmission vehicles may save gas by shifting into neutral when going down hills steep enough to maintain speed(although engine braking is safer on steeper declines). Do not do this in a Hybrid car, they use this ""regenerative engine braking"" to generate electricity and charge the batteries. NOTE: This strategy will result in more wear and tear on your brakes. Neither of these strategies is recommended for normal automatic cars.








, Gasoline actually evaporates right out of your tank, and it does so faster when you park directly in the sun - winter or summer. Parking in the shade also keeps it cooler inside, and you will need less A/C to cool off when you get back in. If there is no shade available, park so that your gas tank (the actual tank under the car, not the valve to fill it) is facing away from the direct sun. Also, today's fuel systems are supposed to be airtight. Your gas cap should have a seal in it. Make sure that the seal is keeping the fumes in and outside air out.

Choose the right gas station to trial and stick with it for duration of the steps below.,
Ensure that your vehicle's engine has been serviced and that all glow-plugs are operating efficiently.,
Inquire at your car dealership about fuel additive for your diesel engine.,
When you go to the pumps, try your best to always fill your car all the way up.,
Reset your vehicle's ""Trip"" odometer whenever you fill up.

Engine braking (gear down) to slow or stop, in modern diesel engines uses less fuel than just braking, or coasting to a stop either in neutral or by holding the clutch down.,
Many drivers forget that every electrical convenience being operated consumes fuel.,
Some dealerships offer ""chips"" for your onboard computer that upgrade your vehicles fuel economy.,
When you finally empty your tank, note your ""Trip"" odometer reading.",How to Drive a Turbo Diesel Car with Manual Transmission Efficiently," Not all diesel fuels are equal quality. Some are ""dirtier"" than others, and will negatively affect your mileage. Switching stations usually means switching the specific type of diesel fuel, so stay consistent. Find a gas station that offers a low price on diesel fuel, and also offers self service diesel pumps. Some stations offer further discounts if you pay with cash or debit. Your car dealership should be able to recommend a gas station that is best for your car.






;
, Inefficient functioning of your glow-plugs means inefficient engine starts, which wastes fuel.








, Many will increase your mileage while helping keep your engine clean. Factor the cost of this additive, and how often you are expected to add it, onto the cost of your fuel.








, It will make measuring your trial much easier.








,, For example, many diesel vehicles have a ""DO NOT TOP OFF"" warning written on them. If present, heed this warning and communicate it to gas station attendants filling your vehicle.








, This usually means that your glow-plug light is no longer illuminated. Turning the ignition before your glow plug is ready may waste fuel. During some colder weather, some car dealerships recommend that you ""double glow"" to get the glow plug hotter. This consists of glowing your plug, and when it indicates ""ready"", turning off your ignition, and repeating the glow again before turning your ignition. This may allow for a more efficient start in some vehicles at certain low temperatures. Besides, glowing your plugs consumes no fuel, so there is no disadvantage.








, This is the single biggest change you can make to see dramatic improvements in your fuel economy. If optimal fuel economy is your goal, be ready to sacrifice any aggressive or ""performance"" driving habits you may have.








, These are normally ""highway speeds"" somewhere around 60 mph (100 kph) in 5th gear but it will vary from car to car. Accelerating to that habitual ""20% over the speed limit"" will negatively impact your fuel consumption considerably.








, Your on board computer is better at efficiently maintaining speed than you are. Humans tend to ""over correct"" by accelerating a little too much, braking or decelerating, applying the gas pedal again, etc. This wastes fuel, a little at a time.








, Get into the habit of spending the least amount of time possible in the lower gears. Conversely, gear down (or speed up) whenever you hear your car struggling in a high gear. You should not feel a strain on your transmission, but most people tend to wrongly delay their shifting to higher gears by several hundred RPM. You will feel a slight decline in your acceleration when you shift sooner, but once again, try hard to shed any addiction to power, speed, and acceleration. Those things are incompatible with optimizing fuel mileage. Try hard to retrain yourself to the new shift-times.








, A ""road trip"" on the highway is the ideal case since you can maintain a relatively steady speed, not be idling at stop signs/lights very often, and not be restarting your vehicle too often. With any other type of trip (to work, to a friends, etc.) stay on highways for as long as you can.








, This is because modern diesels have direct injection which is computer controlled. At idle, the injectors are delivering a very small amount if fuel. When you use the engine to slow the vehicle at speed (throttle closed), the injectors shut off. While the engine braking (gearing down) method of stopping is easier on your brakes, it is harder on the clutch. Brakes cost less than clutches do, so it depends on the situation for what the better choice is.








, Try to keep defrost, seat warmers, radio, fans, etc at a minimum. Turn off your full lights during the daytime and let your daytime running lights do the rest. Also, many defrost options will not turn off automatically, so monitor them diligently. Air conditioning is the worst fuel-consumer. Use it sparingly if you wish to conserve fuel. Turning the windows down also wastes fuel, although some people argue whether or not it wastes more or less than air conditioning, and this fact varies at different speeds. The fact is, any time air is being removed from the passenger cabin through an opening, it is creating some degree of drag from an aerodynamic standpoint, however small. Simply be aware of it. Also, while your engine is turned off, limit electrical convenience use (radio etc) since the car will have to recharge the battery accordingly after it starts.








, Many people purchase these expensive chips without factoring in their cost. These chips should be viewed as an investment. Armed with numbers of your regular fuel consumption, average speeds, etc, you should calculate how long it will take the chip to pay for itself. Some discover that it is longer than they plan to own the vehicle, making it a foolish purchase for them. Make the right financial choice for yourself, since saving money on fuel consumption is what it's all about.








, This should act as your ""score"" of how many miles/kilometers you managed to get out of your vehicle on that tank. Also note the amount of fuel you used to fill your tank in gallons. Miles / gallons = MPG. Beating this score becomes the goal by experimenting with different driving patterns, speeds, routes, fuel, additives, etc. Just remember to make small changes, one at a time, or else you will never know what is working for or against you.

Brake in a controlled manner.,
Accelerate smoothly.,
Minimize distractions.",How to Drive Economically1," Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you’ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don’t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel., Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money., Whether you’re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions.Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It’s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.

Use air conditioning wisely.,
Cut down on electronics.,
Use your gears effectively.",How to Drive Economically2," At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way., Your car’s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren’t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings., Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car’s engine.To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration.While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently.Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you’re new to the technique.

Check your tire pressure regularly.,
Use the right specification of engine oil.,
Get your car serviced regularly.",How to Drive Economically3," Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently., Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner’s manual., Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best."

Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle., Getting lost certainly won’t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you’re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient., Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You’ll also save your car from more wear and tear., Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start “cold” less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip."

Do the math.",How to Calculate Your Car's Fuel Efficiency (MPG)2," This may sting a little, but it is key to getting an accurate reading.

, Before even pulling away from the pump, write down your current mileage. We will call this Mileage A.

, To get as accurate a reading as possible, drive until the tank is less than half full. The longer you can go before getting gas, the better.

, Try to use the same station using the same pump as the first fill up, as pumps may be calibrated differently. This time, pay attention to how many gallons it takes to fill up the tank. This is usually shown at the pump. We will call this Gallons.

, This number we will call Mileage B.

, The formula for determining your MPG is this:


MPG = (Mileage B - Mileage A)÷Gallons.
Subtract Mileage A from Mileage B. This will give you the number of miles you drove since your last fill-up.
Divide your answer by the number of gallons (Gallons B) it took to fill up your tank. This will give you your car's MPG.

Verify your odometer.,
Go to the first marker.,
Calculate the offset.",How to Calculate Your Car's Fuel Efficiency (MPG)5," Not all cars reflect accurate odometer readings. This will not only incorrectly reflect the number of miles you've driven, it will also give you an inaccurate picture of your MPG.


Many freeways have ""mileage check sections."" They are stretches of road several miles or kilometers long, with mileage markers along the way. If one near you has this feature, use it. Otherwise, look on the map and find a stretch of road or freeway, and mark out an accurate 5 or 10 mile (or kilometer) distance.

, Set your trip odometer to 0 as you pass the marker.


At the end of the run, note your trip odometer. An accurate odometer will reflect the distance you traveled.
If your odometer is higher than the distance traveled, your fuel efficiency will be better than you had calculated. You actually traveled further than you calculated with just the straight odometer reading. Conversely, if your odometer is lower than the actual distance traveled, your MPG is lower as well.

, We will call the actual distance traveled ""A,"" and the miles shown on the trip odometer ""T"". We'll call offset ""O."" The formula for determining the offset is:


O=A÷T.
For example, if you travel 5 miles, and your odometer says you've traveled 4-1/2, your formula would read:
O = 5÷4.5; O=1.11. To get your actual mileage for your MPG formula, you would subtract Mileage A from Mileage B as normal, then multiply the result by 1.11 before finishing your MPG calculation.
If Mileage B - Mileage A = 100, multiply by O (1.11). In this example, you actually traveled 111 miles.
If your odometer says you traveled 5-1/2 miles, your formula would read:
O=5÷5.5; O=.91. Again, you would multiply Mileage B - Mileage A by O.
If Mileage B - Mileage A = 100, multiply by O (0.91). In this example, you only traveled 91 miles.

"
"
Know that the equation for fuel consumption is ""Miles Driven divided by Amount of Gas Used."",
Reset the ""trip odometer"" after you fill up your tank.,
Record the miles on the trip odometer right before you buy more gas.,
Drive your car until the tank is almost empty.,
Record the amount of gas you buy in gallons.,
Divide mileage by fuel usage to see your car's fuel consumption.,
Practice calculating with an example.",How to Calculate Fuel Consumption1," A car's fuel consumption is a measure of miles driven per gallon of gas. If you know the distance you drove and how many gallons fit in your tank, you can simply divide the miles by the gas to get your ""miles per gallon,"" or mpg.


You can perform the same calculation with kilometers and liters as well.
The best time to record is right after you fill your car with gas.;
, Newer cars have a trip odometer that you can set to zero at any time. It is usually on the dashboard or center console, with a small button you can hold to reset it to zero. Set it to zero when you fill up the car and check it when you need to fill up again -- this is you mileage since you last bought gas.


Your trip odometer will say ""0 miles.""
If you don't have a trip odometer, record the number of miles on your car as ""Starting Mileage."" For example, if your car has 10,000 miles on it when you fill your tank, write ""10,000.""

, Before you start filling up your car at the gas station, record the mileage on the odometer as ""Final Mileage.""


If you do not have a trip odometer, subtract your ""Starting Mileage"" from your current mileage to find out how far your traveled. If your odometer now says 10,250 for example, subtract 10,000. You drove 250 miles on that tank of gas.

, You can perform this calculation no matter how much gas is left in the tank, but the more gas you use the more accurate your reading will be.

, Refill your tank completely and note how many gallons/liters you needed to fill the tank back up. This is you ""Fuel Usage.""


You must refill your tank completely for this to work, otherwise you don't know how much gas your car used since your last tank.

, This tells you how many miles you drove per gallon of gas. For example, if you drove 335 miles before refueling, and you filled your car up with 12 gallons of gas, your fuel consumption was 27.9 miles per gallon, or mpg (335 miles / 12 gallon = 27.9 mpg).


If you measured in kilometers and liters your answer will be in kilometers per liter (kpl). Many Europeans multiply this answer by 100 to get ""kilometers per 100 liters"" of gas.
You have to start from a full tank and return to a full tank to know exactly how much gas your car consumed.

, Terry's odometer reads 23,500 with a full tank. After driving for a few days he needs to buy gas. The odometer reads 23,889, and it takes 12.5 gallons to refill his tank. What was his fuel consumption?


Fuel Consumption = (Final Mileage - Starting Mileage) / Fuel Usage
Fuel Consumption = (23,889mi - 23,500mi) / 12.5 gallons
Fuel Consumption = 389mi / 12.5 gallons
Fuel Consumption = 31.1 mpg

Park for easy departure.",How to Hypermile," Poorly maintained or out of tune cars are a significant source of pollution. These driving techniques won't work if you don't properly maintain your car, which you should do whether you're hypermiling or not:


Keep your car tuned up. Out of tune cars are more inefficient and produce more pollution. A regular schedule of maintenance for you car is the first step to even having a car you can hypermile with.
Use high performance spark plugs. High performance spark plugs like iridium-tipped ""performance"" spark plugs create a larger combustion spark which contributes to fuller, more efficient burn in the combustion chamber. This provides slightly more power, better fuel efficiency and lower emissions.
Use the lowest viscosity oil that is recommended by the manufacturer. Using anything lower than what is recommended can be unsafe. If the car is not ""taking oil"" - burning it or leaking - switch to synthetic oil (and ATF), as those greatly reduce internal powertrain friction, improve mileage and longevity. At the same time, oil changes can be done much less frequently, thus compensating for higher oil cost.
Consider using very lightweight 0W-20 motor oil. Lightweight motor oil reduces the amount of work your engine has to do since it's easier to pump. Using 0W-20 motor oil can help to increase the engine's mileage, but at the expense of potentially reducing engine life.;
, Correctly maintained tires are very important to hypermiling - they're the only way that your car touches the road, and incorrectly maintained tires can cause significant fuel inefficiency.


Align and balance the wheels. Car wheels are sometimes worn down unevenly or weighted or aligned very slightly off-center, which reduces efficiency.
Check tire pressure regularly. If the tires are incorrectly inflated, then there will be excess drag, or insufficient surface contact with the road, causing significant decreases in fuel efficiency.
Don't over-inflate tires to increase rolling or coasting distance. This can lead to increased wear and loss of traction. In extreme cases the tires may pop causing a catastrophic accident.
Make sure you have clean headlights and that they are working properly. For many hypermiling techniques you'll be varying your following distance from cars. Seeing the car in front of you is vital for safety as well as for efficiency.

, Get rid of the ""junk in the trunk"" — the more weight you're carrying, the more the engine and drive-train have to work. Removing extra weight increases efficiency.


Don't remove stuff from the trunk you might well need! A percent or two mileage decrease is much better in both time and fuel than a long, otherwise unnecessary trip to the mechanic because you took the spare tire and tire changing kit out of your car.

, Generally, it's better for your fuel economy if you maintain a steady speed, which is why using cruise control and driving at or below the speed limit is an important part of hypermiling.

However, varying your speed in relation to the actual terrain you're driving over is also necessary., When you're driving plan a path that doesn't require braking followed by a sudden start. Careful coasting can reduce your gas usage so much that acceleration won't even cause a hiccup in your cruising mpg.


On newer cars if the car is in gear and your foot is off the accelerator, the injectors shut off completely, creating essentially ""free"" mileage — your car's going but you're not using gas beyond a small amount for engine braking, or the engine's resistance to your costing.
Don't coast by disengaging the clutch and/or putting the car in neutral. This will cause the engine to go into idle which uses up gas more gas than simply leaving the car in gear and letting it coast along with minimal engine input., Coasting can can be frustrating and difficult if other drivers keep cutting in front of you. Use basic safety techniques and common sense to keep your coasting safe.


Keep your foot ready to use the brake. If you do need to stop suddenly you should be able to react quickly. Since you're using the accelerator as little as possible, braking or not braking is your primary means of controlling your speed.
Obeying traffic laws is more important than saving gas. This is true from a cost:benefit perspective as well as just plain common sense. After all, if you have to pay a $500 ticket for coasting right through a stop sign and another $2,000 per year in increased insurance premiums after getting into an accident while hypermiling, you've basically eaten all the savings you created hypermiling in the first place.

, The 'accelerator' is so named because it pushes more fuel into the engine, making it run faster — and also lowering your fuel economy and increasing your output of pollutants. Go gentle on the accelerator and you'll see savings in your gas bill.


Push the pedal down slowly, and lift it up as soon as you know you're going to need to stop (when you see a red light, a stop sign, or brake lights from the car ahead of you) so that you can coast the rest of the way.
When hypermiling, you should never need to push down the pedal by more than an inch (2.5cm).Some recent cars may in fact have pedals that ""push back"" when you're accelerating too aggressively.

, Fuel efficient vehicles actually generate better gas mileage when a ""brisk"" acceleration method is used. Slow acceleration will yield less mileage on such highly efficient cars. But any acceleration makes for terrible mileage, so get the acceleration out of the way so that you can cruise (excellent mileage!)

, Most people waste a significant amount of gas simply sitting in traffic or at a stop sign, not going anywhere. Turning off the engine when you stop for more than one minute can improve fuel efficiency by 19%.


In cold weather, letting your car idle to warm up reduces fuel economy and creates additional pollution; all you need to do is drive gently for 5-10 minutes. If you're following the previous two steps, you're going to be driving gently all the way anyway, so you may as well use that for your engine's warmup.

, Pulse and glide is a technique that can dramatically increase your mileage, but is best when you are on a road where there are few other people around. ""Pulse"" or accelerate up to a speed that is the higher end of a range of speeds that are appropriate. Do this using one of the sweet spots for mileage/power ratio on your car. For the Prius these spots are ~15 mph (24 km/h) and 25 mph (40 km/h), and correspond to times at which the gas engine is powering the car and charging the battery.
""Glide"" between periods of acceleration, but use the accelerator to provide electric assist. This requires knowing how hard to push and in which circumstances. Use your car's consumption screen to provide feedback. Get used to the maximum electric assist you can use and you'll go further between pulses, further increasing your mileage.

, Generally, this means you should go slower up hills, and faster down hills. Going uphill slower helps prevent wasting more gas than is necessary to get up the hill. Going downhill faster uses less gas and produces valuable momentum that you can use instead of engine power. If you combine the two in areas with small hills, you'll see much higher mileage.


While going downhill, you can go faster using less gas. As such, don't lay off the pedal completely — use it until you're going a little faster than normal.
Use every downhill slope to your advantage. For instance, when coming down a hill and faced with a red light at the bottom (where it levels out), try to stop well before the light so that you can use the remaining downhill slope to your advantage when you need to move again.
Avoid stopping on an incline heading upwards. Starting from a dead stop on a hill is the worst scenario in terms of fuel economy — your engine is fighting the weight of the car, plus the car's acceleration downhill from gravity. Stop at the top of the hill, or stop before you climb the hill when safe to do so.

, Cars create a wake of disrupted, lower-density air behind them as they drive. Drafting is driving through this area of disrupted air — it is much more aerodynamically efficient than simply bulling through still air. This is a controversial practice, and you should carefully consider whether you want to do this.


Be extremely careful when drafting. You may find yourself focusing on the car you are drafting off rather than the road in front of you. Maintain a safe distance when drafting and keep aware of surrounding traffic.
Drafting off of tractor trailers is not efficient. Drafting off a tractor trailer or ""big rig"" in hopes of cutting wind resistance is usually not worth it. At best, staying 2 seconds behind the truck (176 feet at 60 mph) from the rear of the trailer results in fuel savings of less than 10%.Drafting off of tractor trailers can be very dangerous. The distance needed to get more substantial savings is too close for safety. Trucks are extremely heavy, with corresponding handling challenges — the safest place to be in relation to one is simply anywhere but next to it. The rear end of a truck is often fairly high, so a small car can strike too high on the car's body to absorb a collision safely, and a tire blowout while tailgating can throw a truck tire tread at your windshield, passing through your windshield and resulting in severe injury or even death. Trailer and truck tires also often throw pebbles and other road debris that can result in serious damage to your car.

, Air conditioners consume a lot of energy to extract the heat from air, siphoning off up to a few miles per gallon. However, opening the windows creates aerodynamic drag, disrupting the flow of air across the car, which can also reduce efficiency. For this reason, using the air conditioner really only makes sense when it's cheaper than the increase in drag from just opening your windows.


The air conditioner is typically more efficient than open windows at high speeds over about 45 mph (72 km/h). The climate control system's ventilation fan, without AC, uses negligible energy but can be weak and carry in some engine heat. For the best of both worlds - quiet, cooling, and a breeze - within reason, adjust the window openings to direct air from a little opening into an efficient crossflow or brisk vortex.
While there is some debate between using air conditioning and opening the windows, hardcore hypermilers simply bring ice water in the car with them so they can stay cool with the windows closed and the AC off.
Auto A/C systems work most efficiently while set on the coldest temperature with the lowest fan speed., If you live in a hot climate where you simply must use the air conditioner, try cycling it on and off rather than keeping it on all the time. With the air conditioner off and the fan blowing, the air will continue to blow cool air for several minutes. When the air begins to get warm, turn the air conditioner back on for a few minutes until the air is cool again, and again turn off the air conditioner.


The effectiveness of cycling your air conditioner will depend on your model of car. In some cars, the air conditioner can run at variable strengths, and may be used less intensively by the fan and air mix when turned down.
Beware of continually adjusting climate control systems, especially those with lots of electronic controls or a thermostat rather than simple fan speed settings and stiff dials to adjust fan speed. Servos deep within the car can die and take a lot of labor to replace.
Regular gas (and other internal-combustion) cars' engines make plenty of ""waste"" heat, so use the heater all you like.

, While opening a convertible, as convertible owners may argue, is basically the entire point of having a convertible, lowering your convertible top significantly decreases your fuel efficiency. The large, open cavity in the car created by the car's open cabin creates a significant amount of drag that makes the car work harder to push against more air as it drives.

, If you have a choice between various routes, go for the one with the least number of stops - stopping and starting again from a dead stop is very expensive in terms of gas.


If you have multiple stops in one trip, plan it so that you go to your furthest destination first and make the rest of your stops on your way back. By taking your longest drive at the beginning, you give the car enough time to warm up for the remainder of the trip; if you took the short trips first, your car would take longer to warm up (because of the brevity of each trip). Since engines do not operate efficiently until they are warm, taking your longest drive first increases fuel efficiency.
Country roads are good because you don't have to stop (and go) as much and you don't have to accelerate/brake to get on/off (like with the highway). Steep uphills or downhills will have impacts on your fuel economy as well.
If you're driving on sloped roads, it's useful to think about where you should come to a full stop, because that will affect how hard you need to accelerate.

, Instead of searching for the perfect spot close to an entrance (which will involve stop-and-go driving, especially with pedestrians involved and other drivers pulling in or out of their spots) pull into a spot that's further away from the entrance.


Look for the parking spot with the highest elevation and park face-out so that when you start the car and the engine is cold (at the lowest efficiency) you can use gravity in your favor without having to spin your car around.

Remember that fuel consumption changes based on your driving.,
Record multiple tanks of gas in a row to find your average fuel consumption.,
Set your trip odometer to zero with a full tank of gas.,
Record how many gallons of gas you purchase each time you fill up.,
Drive for normally for several weeks.,
Fill up your tank fully after 2-3 weeks.,
Add up the number of gallons you bought.,
Divide total miles by total gallons.,
Know that your car's advertised mileage is often overestimated.",How to Calculate Fuel Consumption2," For example, stopping and starting the car a lot uses much more gas than driving at a constant pace. This is why highway consumption is always less than city consumption.


Cruise control can help you get better fuel consumption.
Fuel consumption gets worse the faster you drive.
Since AC uses gasoline, using it will diminish your fuel consumption., To get a more accurate picture of your car's fuel consumption, you need to have more data. By driving for longer and averaging your fuel consumption you eliminate ""glitches"" in your data.


Say, for example, that you calculated your fuel consumption one day as you drove up into the mountains. Because climbing uphill takes more fuel, your fuel consumption would look much lower than it normally is.

, Set your odometer to zero and don't reset it after you get a tank of gas. If you don't have an odometer, record how many miles are on your car with a full tank of gas.

, To get a more accurate measure of fuel consumption, you need to know how much gas you are using. Each time you fill up, write down the number of gallons you purchase and save it.

, Do not reset your trip odometer as you drive. Make sure your fill up your car 3-4 times for an accurate reading. Try to do this during a month of average driving, as big trips or unexpected traffic will change your fuel consumption.


You do not need to fill your car all the way up each time. As long as you record the number of gallons you put in you can calculate fuel consumption.

, When you are ready to calculate your fuel consumption, top your car off and record the number of gallons you put in.

, This represents the total gas used over this period of time.


If I bought three tanks of gas, 12 gallons, 3 gallons, and 10 gallons, then my total gas usage would be 25 gallons.

, Use your trip odometer to see how many miles you traveled total, then divide this by gallons to get your average fuel consumption. While this is the exact number of miles per gallon during your test period, it is a good estimate for your car's average fuel consumption.


For example, if you used 25 gallons of gas, and drove 500 miles during that time, then your average fuel consumption would be 20 miles per gallon (500 miles / 25 gallons = 20 mpg).

, By law, car makers must post the average fuel consumption for cars. However, these are only estimates, and they are frequently on the high end.You can look up your car's fuel consumption online through this US Department of Energy website, but to find your car's actual miles per gallon you'll have to calculate it yourself.


If your calculation is drastically different from the suggest average, you may need to bring your car to a mechanic.

Avoid using the air conditioner.,
Drive at the speed limit.,
Drive defensively.,
Use cruise-control for long, flat stretches.,
Turn off your car in traffic.,
Avoid rooftop cargo carriers.,
Keep your tires well-inflated.,
Replace your air filter.",How to Calculate Fuel Consumption3," The AC uses gasoline to cool your car, which means you have less gasoline to actually drive with. Turn down the AC or turn it off once the car is cool to make your car more efficient.


Running AC on max can decrease your fuel economy by almost 25%., The faster you drive your car the more fuel you will consume. This is not a small change, either -- every 5 miles per hour your drive over 50mph is the equivalent of paying $0.19 more for each gallon of gas., It takes more energy to start moving a car then to keep it moving. That means if you are constantly tailgating people, stopping and starting, or trying to pass, you're using far more fuel than if you were keeping an even pace.


Try not to brake or accelerate harshly. Brake early instead of slamming on the pedal., Cruise control will keep your car at a consistent and even speed, which avoids burning up fuel unnecessarily with small accelerations and stops., Idling, or leaving your car on when it isn't moving, wastes gas without moving you anywhere. When possible, cut the engine to save on precious gasoline., These greatly diminish your cars aerodynamics, slowing your car down and causing you to use more fuel. In general, towing trailers or loading up the trunk is a more fuel efficient option.

, Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.3% if all four tires are low. Using the free air pump at most gas stations, inflate the tires up to the PSI recommended in your owner's manual.Some cars list the proper tire pressure on a sticker in the driver's side door or the glove compartment.

, This is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to bump up your fuel efficiency. Make sure you buy the right filter for your car by bringing the make, model, and year in to your local auto shop and asking for recommendations--every car needs a different filter.


For newer cars, replacing the air filter will not help fuel efficiency very much. It will, however, make it easier for your car to accelerate without issues."

Anticipate the need to stop.,
Allow adequate time and distance to stop.,
Come to a complete stop.,
Recognize the kind of intersection.,
Look both ways for traffic.,
Check for pedestrians.,
Obey right-of-way.,
Cross the intersection.,
Obey right-of-way at a four-way or three-way stop.,
Stop at a school bus stop sign.School buses have stop signs that pop up when the buses are stopped to let schoolchildren on or off.,
Stop for pedestrians, whether or not a regular stop sign is visible.,
Don’t cross an intersection if traffic is backed up.If you come to a stop sign at an intersection, and traffic on the other side of the street headed in your direction is not moving, do not cross the intersection.,
Always yield to emergency vehicles.If you are at a stop sign at an intersection and it would otherwise be your “turn,” wait if you see or hear an emergency vehicle (ambulance, fire truck, police car, etc.),
Obey a police officer directing traffic.If there is a police officer or other official at an intersection directing traffic, you should obey that person’s orders.,
Request a stop sign if you think one is needed.",How to Stop at a STOP Sign," Sometimes, you will see a stop sign clearly in the distance as you approach it. In other cases, such as on hills or around blind curves, you may not be able to see a stop sign long before you are close to it. In some of these cases, you will see a separate sign warning you ahead of time that a stop sign is approaching. Whatever the situation, be prepared to slow down as soon as you see a stop sign., The exact amount of time or distance you need to stop will depend upon a number of factors, including your speed, the weather, and the physical conditions of the road. However, you should start slowing down at least 150 feet before the stop sign.If you are traveling at high speeds, if the weather conditions are poor, or if the road conditions are dangerous (for instance, if the stop sign is at the bottom of a very steep hill), then you will need to allow more time and distance to slow down.


If you stay within the speed limit enforced on a given road, you should generally have adequate time to slow down and halt at a stop sign, whether or not you see it long ahead of time.

, When you come upon a stop sign, come to a complete halt so that your vehicle has no momentum.Do not simply slow down or pause.


Try to come smoothly to a stop rather than slamming on the brakes.
If there is a solid white bar or a crosswalk painted across the intersection, you should stop before it, so that you don’t block it.If there is no painted stopping line, then stop slightly before the stop sign so that you can see in all directions at the intersection.
If you cannot see clearly around the intersection, slowly pull forward slightly until you can see, and come to a complete stop again.
If another vehicle is already stopped at the stop sign in front of you, you must first stop behind it, then again come to a complete stop at the stop sign once that vehicle moves on.

, Stop signs may be used at several kinds of intersections, and different traffic rules are enforced at each. It is important to know which kind of stop you are approaching so that you know which rules to follow.A two-way stop is used when two roads intersect, but traffic on only one road is required to stop at the intersection.
A four-way or all-way stop is used when two roads intersect, and traffic moving in all directions must stop at the intersection.
A T-junction is formed when one road dead-ends in another perpendicular to it (forming a shape that resembles the letter “T”). T-junctions may have a three-way stop, in which traffic moving in all directions must stop at the intersection, or they may have only a stop sign for the traffic moving toward the intersection from the road that dead-ends.
Many stop signs will have a smaller sign below the red octagon indicating if the stop is a four-way, three-way, etc.

, Even after you stop, you are required to let any traffic moving across your path go by first.If there is no traffic, you are free to proceed through the intersection (or turn) after coming to a complete stop. If traffic is visible but at a distance far enough away that it will not reach the intersection before you cross it, you may proceed.However, you must always move across an intersection at a reasonable speed, and avoid trying to cross when traffic is dangerously close to the intersection.


Only cross the intersection if any traffic is a safe distance away. The exact distance will depend on the speed of the oncoming traffic and other concerns, so always use good judgment and play it safe.
Remember that traffic on the road may include bicyclists, motorcycles, and other vehicles, in addition to automobiles.

, If there are pedestrians moving across the intersection (people walking, strolling, bicycling, skating, etc.), you are required to let them go by before crossing it yourself.This is true even if there is no other motor vehicle traffic at the intersection. Unless laws in your area specifically state otherwise, you should let pedestrians cross an intersection first even if there is no visible crosswalk.

, If there is already another vehicle (car, motorcycle, bicycle, etc.) stopped at the stop sign across the street from you when you come to the stop sign, you are required to let it proceed first.The vehicle may turn to the left or right (your right or left), or move straight across the intersection. Whatever the case, let that vehicle go by before proceeding through the intersection.


If two vehicles come to a stop at an intersection at the same time, a driver turning left must yield to traffic going straight or turning right.In all cases, let safety prevail.Do everything you can to prevent an accident. For instance, if another vehicle starts to proceed before its “turn,” just let it go by and proceed when the roadway is clear.

, Once the roadway is clear of oncoming vehicles and pedestrian traffic, and you have yielded the right-of-way to any vehicles already stopped at the intersection, you may proceed across it. Move at a reasonable speed, and continue on your way.

, When you come to a four-way or three-way stop, the right-of-way rules are slightly different.Drivers should proceed through the intersection in the order in which they arrive at the stop (regardless of which direction they are moving in), making sure to yield to any pedestrians first. If two cars come to the intersection at the same time, The car to the right has the right of way.

, When you see a bus stopped with its stop sign(s) displayed, come to a complete stop at a safe distance from the bus (15 feet away is recommended). Remain stopped until all children have boarded or exited the bus. Even after the stop sign is put away and the bus moves on, double-check to make sure there are no children in or next to the road. Proceed only when your path is completely clear.

, You should stop for pedestrians at a crosswalk, even if the crosswalk is in the middle of a block rather than at an intersection of two or more roads.In some cases you may see a STOP sign, a small STOP sign icon, or a phrase such as “STOP for Pedestrians.” Whether or not you see such a sign, however, you should come to a complete stop to let pedestrians cross at a crosswalk.

, Wait until traffic clears on the other side and it is safe to proceed through. If you attempt to cross an intersection when traffic is backed up, you may end up blocking the intersection and increasing the chance of an accident or delay.

, coming. Let the emergency vehicle go by first before proceeding through the intersection.

, Follow the official’s signal for when it is your turn to proceed through the intersection, regardless of what normal rules dictate.

, If you think a stop sign is necessary at a certain intersection, contact your local transportation board, road commission, town council, etc. about your suggestion. However, you must make a good case for why the sign is needed, and understand that:Stop signs are not really used to control speed. In fact, studies have show that many drivers tend to increase their speed between stop signs.
Too many stop signs can also increase pollution and cause traffic congestion.
The decision about whether or not to erect a stop sign is usually governed by several factors, such as the number of crashes that have occurred at the intersection, traffic flow and volume, and visibility at the intersection.

Take a nap before hitting the road.,
Have a healthy meal.,
Take vitamins.,
Select the right times to drive.",How to Stay Awake when Driving1," A brief twenty minute sleep can help you recharge before driving. If you have a big drive coming up, try to slip away for a short twenty minute nap before getting on the road. Even less than an hour of sleep can provide the rest you'll need to stay alert driving., Food helps give your body the energy it needs to sustain itself. Prior to driving, have a healthy meal. Opt for energizing foods that will give you the power to stay awake for long hours driving.Go for complex carbohydrates and protein. Whole grains and lean protein, like turkey and chicken, can help you stay alert during long hours on the road.
Avoid convenience foods, such as fast-food, or anything high in sugar or processed carbs. Such foods are likely to make your energy dip shortly after eating.

, Vitamins B and C give you energy. Try taking a vitamin B or C tablet after having a healthy meal. This can help wake you up for a long drive.Talk to your doctor before taking vitamins regularly so you know what dose is safe for you. Also, make sure the vitamins you take do not interfere with existing medication.

, If you can decide when to start driving, drive when you feel your most energetic. Pay attention to your natural energy spikes and dips throughout the day, and plan to drive when you're at your most energetic.For example, if you start to really wake up and feel energetic around 9 AM, plan to drive around that time of day.

Maintain a gap between cars.,
Stay at a consistent speed.,
Avoid changing lanes too often.,
Allow other drivers to merge into your lane.,
Pay attention to the road conditions.,
Avoid taking your eyes off the road.,
Pull over quickly and completely if you have a problem.",How to Avoid Contributing to Traffic Congestion1," Every time you tap your brakes, the cars behind you will do the same. This can cause a ripple effect for miles down the road. Try to keep a gap between you and the car ahead of you. If another car slows down or tries to merge, you should have enough room to slow down without braking suddenly.Keep at least two or three seconds between you and the car in front of you. This means that it should take you two or three seconds at your current speed to reach the other car.;
, Try to stay at the speed limit, or go at the speed of traffic. If you need to slow down, take your foot off the gas, and do not brake unless you need to. In many cases, if you keep a gap between cars, you may be able to slow down without braking.When there's an accident or a breakdown on the side of the road, do not slow down to look. Instead, keep going at the rate of traffic.Cruise control can help you maintain a steady speed on the highway.

, The more you change lanes, the more other cars may have to slow down to accommodate you. While you may sometimes need to move over, try changing lanes only when necessary., By letting cars in the merge lane come into your lane, you’re helping the flow of traffic. If you see cars trying to merge, allow a gap between you and the car ahead of you so that they have room to enter., Stay alert by scanning ahead as far as you can. Remain aware of what is happening around you. Watch for road hazards, accidents, bottlenecks, or other problems along the road.Many highways have signs that will alert you of delays or traffic jams. You can either prepare to slow down or find an alternate route.

, Do not text, read the news, check your social media page, or take your eyes off of traffic, even if traffic has stopped dead. Always watch what is happening in front of you. You never know when traffic will start moving again.

If you are bored, turn on music or try a podcast.

, If your car begins to break down, move to the slow lane, slow down, and pull over as soon as it's safe to do so. Turn on your hazard lights, and use your cell phone to get help immediately.If you are on the side of a busy highway, you should remain in your car. If you must exit, exit on the passenger’s side to avoid getting hit by a car.

Have 100 calorie snacks.,
Drink caffeine.,
Chew gum.,
Watch your portion size.",How to Stay Awake when Driving2," Snacks around 100 calories will help wake you up a little, providing enough sustenance to combat fatigue. Anything heavier than 100 calories may make you crash after eating, so opt for healthy 100 calories snacks while driving.Sunflower seeds are often sold in 100 calorie packs and can keep you energized. Stock up on a few packs of sunflower seeds and eat them as necessary while driving.

, A single cup of coffee contains about 75 milligrams of caffeine. This is enough to wake you up a little while driving, keeping you alert. Have one cup of coffee if you start to feel tired. This should give you an extra jolt that will help you keep going.Keep your eyes open for filling stations and coffee shops along the road. When you feel tired, pull over at one of these places and have a cup of coffee. Plus, you'll get to stretch your legs when not behind the wheel and you could even have a longer sleep if you wish.

, This will keep your mouth busy. If you have something that occupies you, this can help you focus and stay awake. Pick up a couple of packs of chewing gum for a long trip. If you start to feel drowsy, chew some gum.Make sure to go for sugar-free gum. Sugary gum can cause a sugar crash, leaving you feeling more tired than you were before.

, If you have to pull over and eat, go for small portions. Big, heavy meals can cause you to crash and become tired. Go for small portions and tiny meals when you pull over and snack on light foods throughout the drive. A number of small meals will keep you more energized than one or two big meals.For example, have half a sandwich at one stop and, when you're hungry again, pull over and eat the other half.
Remember to go for energizing foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

Try a mid drive nap.,
Turn your music up to 90 decibels.,
If you can, travel with someone.,
Open a window.,
Find media to help you stay entertained.",How to Stay Awake when Driving3," If you're getting tired while driving, pull over and take a nap. A short fifteen to twenty minute nap can recharge your brain, giving you the stamina you need to keep driving. Find a safe place to pull over and nap for about fifteen to twenty minutes.Choose a place far enough away from the main road you will not get hit by oncoming traffic. You should also choose a place that is not too isolated, such as car park near a filling station, for your safety.
Set an alarm. You do not want a twenty minute nap to turn into an hour long nap.

, If you're feeling drowsy, take advantage of your car's stereo system. Turn the music up to at least 90 decibels. This should be disruptive enough that your body will be jarred awake.See if your car's radio measures decibels. If it does not, just try to estimate. Turn up the car's radio until the noise is loud enough that you feel awake.
Only turn the radio or stereo up this high for brief periods when you're tired, however. Habitually listening to music this loud can damage your hearing.

, If at all possible, bring someone else along if you're driving on a long journey for several hours. Having another person in the car can keep you alert as the two of you can take turns driving. If you feel very tired, have the other person drive for a while., The cool sensation of cold wind hitting your face can wake you up. If you start to feel tired, open a window for a few minutes. In addition to providing a cooling sensation, it will create a great deal of background noise. This will prevent you from nodding off., Try listening to something you have to focus on. Listening to music for an entire trip can cause you to zone out. Instead, try listening to things like books on tapes, podcasts, and radio shows. You will end up focusing on the words, which will engage your attention and help prevent you from nodding off."

Recognize the signs that you're too tired to drive.,
Read medication labels carefully.,
Avoid driving between midnight and 6 AM.,
Do not drink alcohol before driving.",How to Stay Awake when Driving4," If you're too tired to drive safely, stop driving for the night. Driving when tired is extremely dangerous and can lead to accidents. If you notice any of the following, you are too tired to drive:Frequent blinking and heavy eyelids
Difficulty keeping your head up
Frequent daydreaming
Missing traffic lines, drifting into other lanes, tailgating
Difficulty remembering the last few miles you drove

, Some medication can cause drowsiness. If you're on any medication, read the label carefully. Make sure drowsiness is not a side effect.If a medication causes drowsiness, it may not be safe to use while driving. If you have a medication you need to take regularly that causes drowsiness, talk to your doctor about how to manage driving while taking the medication.

, These are the times where your circadian rhythm has a natural dip. It is dangerous to drive during these hours as there is an increased risk of falling asleep at the wheel. If at all possible, refrain from driving between midnight and six in the morning., Alcohol, even in small amounts, causes drowsiness. Do not have anything to drink before you need to get behind the wheel of a car."

Carpool to work.,
Take the bus.,
Ride the rails.,
Walk or bike to work.",How to Avoid Contributing to Traffic Congestion2," Ask your coworkers if they would like to start a carpool arrangement. Every member of the carpool can take turns picking up each other and driving to work. This reduces the number of cars on the road while letting you bond with your coworkers.If you can’t find people to carpool at work, you might be able to find a group online or through an app, such as Scoop or Rideshare.
Some cities may have express lanes that only carpools can use. Not only does this cut down on traffic, but it also gets you to work faster!

, Check to see if there any bus stops near your home, work, or major shopping centers. Instead of driving, you can take the bus to get around. You may even be able to buy an unlimited bus pass for a certain amount of time.Many local transits have apps that will tell you when the next bus is coming. They may even locate your nearest bus stop or help you plan a route.

, If your city has a subway or train, you might consider getting a pass so that you can ride it to work or shopping. Subways can get busy too, so leave a little early so that you can get where you need to go. This is a great option for people who live in suburbs outside of a major city., Walking or riding a bicycle are both great ways of getting to your destination without contributing to traffic. Not only will this take cars off the road, but it will improve your health and help the environment as well! It is also a much cheaper way to get around.


If you are riding a bike, obey all traffic laws, and use the bike lanes where you can.

Live closer to your work.,
Work from home if you can.,
Do all of your errands at once.,
Take an alternate route.,
Travel on off-peak hours.",How to Avoid Contributing to Traffic Congestion3," If you can, try to find a home that is closer to your work or to major shopping centers. This will cut down the time you are in the car. It can also make it possible to walk or bike to your destination instead of driving., If your job allows it, try working from home one or two days a week. This will prevent you from having to drive into the office, which will eliminate your commute entirely for the day., Plan your errands carefully so that you only need to make one trip to get what you need each week. This will reduce the amount of trips you need to take and the length of time you spend on the road.Make a list of things you need, and post it to a fridge or door. If you run out of something, write it down right away so that you do not forget it on your list.
Try to do your errands on the way home from work or school. This will help you avoid making a separate trip.

, Check the traffic report either online or on the morning news to see what routes are jammed. If your usual route is busy, try to find a different way to get to work. Most GPS systems will warn you about traffic, and they can also help you find a different route.There are many apps, such as Waze or Intrix, that will give you traffic results as you drive. If a jam develops as you’re driving, they can change your route for you., Major roads typically have rush hour periods where you’re likelier to encounter traffic. To help reduce the burden, try travelling outside of these hours. Plan your errands and tasks for off-peak times, and leave early for work if possible.The hour between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. is usually very busy, as people are going to work or school.Afternoon rush hour in most places occurs between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. because people are leaving work to return home.
Some places may experience a rush around lunchtime as well.

, The ignition point is often located near the steering wheel. It looks like a round piece of metal, often with writing on it, with a keyhole in the center of it. Insert the key all the way into the ignition after you find it.









For most vehicles, you will need to take the key that came with the vehicle. You can usually also use a copy, provided it has been made properly.
Some newer model cars may not have a traditional key. You will need to find a button to start the car on these vehicles; this is usually labeled something like ""engine start"" and placed in a conspicuous location.

, ""Automatic"" refers to a car's transmission. It means that you don't have to do the shifting yourself — the car does it automatically.









If the car has an automatic transmission, there will be only two pedals. In some automatic cars a flat rubber pad is placed on the far left of the driver's foot area; this is a ""dead pedal"" meant to be place to rest your foot and is not a pedal.
Automatic transmission cars have a device called a neutral safety switch that prevents the starter from engaging unless the shift selector is in the ""P"" or ""N"" positions (""Park"" or ""Neutral""). This prevents the car from starting in gear.

,









If the car has a manual transmission, the car will have three pedals; the far left is the clutch pedal.
It is important to make sure the transmission is in neutral — meaning that none of the gears are engaged - before attempting to start the car. If the car is ""in gear"" or sending power from the engine through the transmission to the wheels when the engine starts, the car will lurch when starting up and then stall. Damage to transmissions can also occur in some vehicles if they are started in gear.
You can verify that a manual transmission car is in neutral by lightly jiggling the shifter; if it moves freely, then the transmission is not in gear. If the shifter is stuck, as if in a notch, then the car is in gear. While pressing the clutch with your foot, move the gear shifter out of gear before starting the car.

, You will have to rotate the key past two stops and push against a spring-loaded third and final stop to start the car. Use the same hand that you used to insert the key, and make sure you don't pull the key out while twisting it.









Release the key just after twisting to the ignition point. If you keep the key turned as far as it will go after the engine is running, you will hear a very ugly grinding sound which comes from the gears in the starter and the gears in the engine grinding together. This is of course very bad for the car.
The first two notches are labeled 'ACC' for 'accessories' and the second labeled 'ON'. The first position enables usage of the radio and other electrical accessories; the 'ON' position is the position that the key springs back to after pressing against the ignition.

, Sometimes, after turning your key in the ignition, a perfectly working car will fail to start. Don't worry; it's not the end of the world.









If the key will not move past the first or second notch and the steering wheel will not move, the car has a steering lock engaged. A steering lock is a safety device designed to help make sure the car doesn't start unattended. On these cars you may have to 'jiggle' or shake the steering wheel back and forth a little to allow the keys to turn.
If the car will not start, try pressing firmly on the brake pedal and/or clutch pedal while then turning the key. This is a feature with some newer cars intended to prevent them from taking off unpredictably when they are turned on.
If the car still will not start, try turning the key in the other direction. Some older cars may not follow the same conventions as modern cars.

, Some (not all) manual transmission cars are equipped with a clutch safety switch which interrupts the electricity to the starter unless the clutch is fully depressed; this means that the clutch pedal must be pressed for the car to start.









Once the engine is running, do not release the clutch suddenly with the engine in gear and no pressure on the accelerator; this will result in sudden vehicle movement and most likely stall the engine, causing it to suddenly stop running. You can prevent this from happening by ensuring that the car is not in gear before starting (using the gearshift-jiggling method above).

, Be sure to follow the rules of the road, and be a defensive driver.








, Consult your car's manual and take your car to a mechanic if at all possible. If you really have to get somewhere or if you do not have access to a mechanic you can troubleshoot your car yourself.








, If the car will not start and it is very cold outside, you may need to ""pump the gas"" or add additional fuel to the engine to make it easier to start. Whether you do or not depends on whether your car has a fuel injected or a carburetor engine.









If the car was made before 1990, assume the car has a carburetor. A carburetor is a mechanical device that mixes air and fuel and feeds it into the engine. On these cars, ""pump the gas"" a few times by pressing the accelerator pedal before starting. Pumping the gas in the causes the carburetor to release a small amount of fuel into the engine. Each time you depress the gas pedal on a car equipped with a carburetor, more liquid gas will be squirted into the engine.
Be careful when you are pumping the gas on a cold car. Adding too much gas before a start may ""flood"" the engine, filling it with too much fuel and too little air to ignite properly since liquid fuel does not easily burn. (See the tip on starting a flooded engine.)
If the engine has been flooded, press the gas pedal fully to the floor and crank the engine over. A fully depressed pedal will allow extra air into the engine to dry out the extra fuel. You may have to crank the engine longer than normal to get it to start. When it starts, release the gas.

, Dead batteries are by far the most common reason that engines won't start. In order to get your car running again, you'll want to jump your engine's battery. Otherwise, you'll want to change out a dead battery and replace it with a new one.








, You or your mechanic can perform a simple test to figure out if your alternator needs to be replaced.








, This is a repair that you or your mechanic can perform.

,

Time traffic lights correctly.",How to Drive Slowly," If punctuality is critical, aim to arrive ten to fifteen minutes early, or more. This extra time will allow for unforeseen circumstances, and if you do arrive early, it will give you time to collect yourself and your belongings before proceeding.
, Driving slowly makes it easier to stop if roads are slippery, and gives you more response time if visibility is reduced. Think about the many times a person involved in an accident mentions that they were ""doing the speed limit"" as if that should have prevented it. The reality is that the speed limit is a guide for normal conditions (and mandatory maximum), and does not account for less safe driving conditions. Some of the less safe driving conditions to keep in mind as a genuine safety reason to slow down include:


Ice or snow – sliding along the road, slipping over edges, and spinning out of control are some of the risks with not slowing down for snow and ice conditions.
Rain – hydroplaning is a real risk when the rain is heavy and relentless; visibility is also greatly reduced. Another issue is washouts on the road, which can happen suddenly without warning, as well as landslides.

Fog or mist – when there is thick fog, mist, or low cloud about, visibility is reduced and in some cases severely limited. It is not possible to tell whether an animal might be on the road, or even traffic in the wrong lane, so slowing down makes good sense.
Darkness – without good night vision, humans have difficulty driving well at night. Fatigue and reduced perception also impact night driving, making it much safer to slow down when night driving, especially over long distances.
Wet roadways – even if it's not raining, water across a road can spell trouble. In times of flooding, you are advised to not even attempt to use a road that is suffering from floods as the waters will often be stronger than your car. It only takes 50 centimeter (19.7 in) / 19.6 in of water to lift an all wheel drive and carry it along flood waters.
High winds – cars can drift or shake under the force of high winds, and steering can become difficult. It is even harder if you have a load above or behind the vehicle, and the higher your vehicle sits, the more buffeting the wind will cause.
Winding roads – tight bends can be difficult to execute well unless you slow down; speed can cause you to miss the bend altogether and fly over the road to the other side, and even down a cliff if you're traveling through hills or mountains.

Blind corners – these are corners where you're not able to see oncoming traffic; whenever you cannot see what's coming, it's a good idea to slow down, especially since some people make rash decisions about overtaking even though they cannot see you coming the other way.

, Press the pedal lightly and your moves will be gradual. This will save on fuel, improve traction in slippery conditions, and help you maintain a slower overall speed.

Except in poor driving conditions, do not accelerate very slowly – keep up with traffic overall, at least the slower or more carefully driven vehicles like trucks and minivans. Accelerating too slowly leaves you in potentially dangerous areas such as intersections for periods unexpectedly long to others, can cause dangerous speed mismatches in merges, and can otherwise interfere with traffic patterns.

Braking gently saves wear on the brakes and it is less likely to cause you to skid. To brake gently, leave additional space between you and the car in front of you, and anticipate upcoming braking, such as corners, stoplights, and slow traffic ahead. Driving slowly helps maintain that space and gives you more time to react.

, It's neither a race nor a time for zoning out. The objective is to get where you are going safely, staying alert and in control.

If you feel as though driving is a waste of time and you find yourself speeding just because you want to get the drive over with, see if you can reduce your commute (try driving earlier or later than usual when traffic lessens), or take public transportation, or even telecommute. If these are not realistic options, consider use the time to do something else, such as listening to an audio book, learning a new language, or catching up on the news and current affairs by radio.

, As noted earlier, the speed limits themselves do not indicate the perfect speed for poor conditions and you'll need to use your common sense for that. However, if the traffic speed is reasonable and is setting a comfortable pace, this can be a soothing and safe speed for driving and can help remove your desire to drive too fast.

If your speed tends to inch up when you're not paying attention, follow behind someone who is going a suitable, even speed. Keep a generous, constant distance. Or use cruise control if it's safe to do so (do not use cruise control on windy roads).

, If the road you're traveling has more than one lane in each direction, be courteous and use the lane going closest to your speed. If a narrower road has turnouts, use them to let anyone traveling faster behind you pass. You'll know because they'll be almost tailgating you!

If a narrow road does not have turnouts, find somewhere safe to stop, perhaps every fifteen to thirty minutes, to allow other cars to pass if you're driving very slowly or many vehicles are accumulating behind you.

, This is easier on your brakes and it gives you more control.,, A series of traffic lights, such as on a city street, is generally timed so that a batch of cars can travel through at about the speed limit. The best way to drive through these, where your abilities and traffic allow, is to accelerate promptly from any stop to the speed limit and to continue at that speed–no faster."

Stop completely before changing from forward to reverse (and vice versa).",How to Drive Manual," Especially if this is your first time driving a car with a manual transmission, start slowly and methodically. Put your seat belt on once you sit down. While learning, it can be useful to roll down the windows. This helps you hear the sound of the engine revving and to shift gears accordingly.The pedal on the left is the clutch, the middle one is the brake, and the accelerator is on the right (remember it, from left to right, as C-B-A). This layout is the same for both left-hand drive and right-hand drive vehicles.;
, Before you start pushing down on this unfamiliar pedal on the left, take a moment to figure out the basics of it's function.The clutch disengages the engine from the wheels. When one or both are spinning, the clutch allows you to switch gears without grinding the teeth of each separate gear.
Before you change gears (either to move up or down), the clutch must be depressed (pushed).

, Slide forward enough to allow you to press the clutch pedal (the left pedal, next to the brake pedal) fully to the floor with your left foot., This would also be a good time to take note of how the travel of the clutch pedal differs from that of the brake and gas. It’s also a good opportunity to get used to slowly and steadily releasing the clutch pedal.If you’ve only ever driven automatic cars, it might feel awkward to use your left foot to push a pedal. With practice, you’ll get used to using both feet in concert.

, This is the middle position that feels free when moved from side to side. The vehicle is considered out of gear when:The gearstick is in the neutral position, and/or
The clutch pedal is fully depressed.
Don’t try to use the gearstick without having the clutch pedal depressed, because it simply won't work.

, Make sure the handbrake is on before starting the car, especially if you are a novice.Some cars will start up in neutral without the clutch depressed, but some newer cars will not.

, If you’re on level ground, you should remain stationary; you’ll start rolling if you’re on a hill. If you’re ready to move on to actually driving, make sure to release the handbrake (if it’s engaged) before you drive off., It should be the upper-left position, and there should be some kind of visual layout of the gear pattern on top of the gearstick.Gear patterns can vary, so take some time beforehand to study your car’s gear layout. You may want to practice shifting through the various gears with the engine switched off (and the clutch engaged).

, Continue until you hear the engine speed begin to drop, then push it back in. Repeat this several times until you can instantly recognize the sound. This is the friction point.When you’re shifting gears to start or keep moving, this is the point at which you’ll want to have the accelerator depressed enough to provide power.

, In order to get moving, lift your left foot up from the clutch pedal until the RPMs drop slightly. At the same instant, apply light pressure to the accelerator with your right foot. Balance the light downward pressure on the accelerator with slowly releasing pressure on the clutch pedal. You will probably have to do this several times to find the right combination of up and down pressure.Another way of doing it; is to release the clutch until the point the engine revs down a little, and then applying pressure on the accelerator as the clutch engages. At this point the car will start to move. It is best to have the engine rev just enough to prevent stalling as the clutch pedal is let up. This process may be a little difficult at first because you are new to the extra pedal in a manual car.
Release the clutch fully (that is, slowly remove your foot from the pedal) once you start moving forward under control in first gear.

, If you release the clutch too quickly the engine will stall. If the engine sounds like it is going to stall, hold the clutch where it is or push down a bit further. If you do stall, depress the clutch fully, apply the handbrake, put the car in neutral, switch the engine off and restart the car as normal. Don’t panic.Revving the engine while the clutch is between fully up and fully depressed will wear out the clutch parts prematurely, resulting in slippage or smoking of the clutch parts at the transmission. This is called riding the clutch and should be avoided.

, When your RPM reaches about 2500 to 3000 while the car is in motion, it is time to shift to the next gear — for example, second gear if you are currently in first. The actual RPMs at which shifting is required will vary by the car you are driving, however. Your engine will begin to race and speed up, and you must learn to recognize this noise.Depress the clutch pedal until it disengages and guide the gearstick straight down from first gear into the bottom-left position (which is second gear in most configurations).
Some cars have a ""Shift Light"" or indications on the tachometer that will tell you when you need to shift, so you don't rev the engine too fast.

, Shifting gears in motion is the same as shifting into first from a stationary position. It’s all about listening, looking, and feeling for the engine’s cues and getting the up-and-down timing of your feet on the pedals correct. Keep practicing and you’ll get the hang of it.Once in gear and on the accelerator, you should completely remove your foot from the clutch pedal. Resting your foot on the clutch pedal is a bad habit, as it applies pressure to the clutch mechanism — and the increased pressure will cause the clutch to wear out prematurely.

, If you are going too slow for the current gear you’re in, your car will shudder as if it’s about to stall. To shift down gears while in motion, follow the same process of depressing the clutch and releasing the accelerator, shifting gears (say, from third to second), and letting off the clutch while depressing the accelerator., To come to a stop in a fully controlled manner, shift down gradually until you reach first gear. When it’s time to come to a complete stop, move your right foot from the accelerator to the brake pedal and press down as much as is required. As you slow to about 10 mph (16 km/h), the car will be on the verge of shaking and vibrating. Press the clutch pedal fully down and move the gearstick into neutral to prevent stalling the car. Use the brake pedal to stop completely.You can also stop while in any gear by depressing the clutch fully and using the brake while shifting into neutral. This should only be done when you need to stop quickly, though, as it puts you in less control of the vehicle.

, While you can legally practice alone on any public road with a valid driver’s license, you will pick up the nuances of driving a manual car faster if you have an experienced driver accompanying you Start off in a flat, isolated area like a large (and empty) car park, then move on to quiet suburban streets. Drive around the same circuit repeatedly until you start to remember the various skills involved., When you’re new to driving a manual, plan routes that avoid traffic lights at the top of steep hills. Your timing and coordination in working the gear stick, clutch, brake, and accelerator needs to be fairly sharp in order to avoid drifting backwards when you shift into first gear.You need to be able to quickly (but smoothly) move your right foot from releasing the brake to depressing the accelerator, while at the same time letting out the clutch. You can use the parking brake to limit backward drifting if necessary, but always remember to disengage it as you start moving forward.

, Unlike automatics, manual transmission cars don’t have a “park” gear. But, simply putting the car in neutral opens the possibility of your car rolling freely, especially if parked on an incline or decline. Always use the handbrake, but don’t rely on it alone to keep your car in place whilst parked.If you are parked facing uphill, shut the car off in neutral, then shift into first gear and apply the parking brake. If facing downhill, do the same but shift into reverse. This will prevent the wheels from rolling in the direction of the slope.
On extreme inclines, or simply to be extra cautious, you can also place chocks (angled blocks) behind your wheels to prevent movement.

, Making a complete stop when changing directions is an easy way to reduce your likelihood of causing expensive damage to your gearbox.It is strongly recommended to stop completely before going from reverse to first gear. However, it is possible on most manual transmissions to shift into first or possibly second when the car is moving backwards at a slow speed, but it is not recommended as this can cause excessive wear on the clutch.
In some cars, reverse gear has a lock out mechanism to prevent you for engaging it accidentally. Before using the reverse gear, make sure you know about this locking mechanism and how to disengage it before selecting reverse.

Some cars will have electronic controls (usually on the left side of the seat), while older cars will usually have a lever underneath the seat that lets you control the position of the seat. But you can tell the difference.;
, In an automatic car, the two foot pedals control acceleration and braking, respectively. The rightmost pedal (which is usually smaller than the other pedal) is the accelerator, and pressing down on it makes the car move forwards; the harder you press it, the faster the car will move. The pedal to the left, which is usually larger than the accelerator; is the brake pedal, and pressing down on it slows the car down.


Even if you feel more confident using your left foot, always use your right foot to reach both pedals. It will feel strange at first if you're left-footed, but getting used to it is very important because it's proper technique and ultimately much safer.

Never use both feet at once to reach the pedals. Only use one foot — your right foot — to use each pedal. This will make it impossible to accidentally press down on both pedals at the same time.

, Your car should have three mirrors: one rear-view mirror, which allows you to see directly the rear windshield behind you, and two outside mirrors which let you see to either side of the car and protect you from blind spots.Your rear-view mirror should be positioned so that when you're in your normal driving position, you can see directly behind you and as much of the rear windshield as possible.
The Society of Automotive Engineers has one recommendation for how to position your outside mirrors in order to eliminate blind spots. It recommends positioning the mirrors further outward than normal, so that they just overlap with the viewing angle of the rear-view mirror.Although disorienting at first, this positioning actually allows the driver to see cars in their blind spots which they might otherwise only be able to spot by looking over their shoulder.

, The parking brake is a longer lever with a button on it's very tip. When the parking brake is pulled up, it helps lock the car into place on the ground, ensuring that it doesn't move. When the brake is let down, it is disengaged and the car can freely move. Make sure that your parking brake is disengaged before you start driving.

, The gear stick is usually positioned in between the two front seats of a car, and it controls the gearbox (park, neutral, drive, reverse). Sometimes in certain vehicles, the shift lever is on the right-side of the steering wheel.


If your gear stick is engaged in Park and you turn your ignition on, the car won't move forward no matter how hard you press down on the accelerator.
If your gear stick is in Neutral, your car's natural momentum will continue to move it forward.
If your gear stick is in Reverse, your car will move backwards instead of forward when you take your foot off the brake.
If your gear stick is in Drive, your car will move forwards when you take your foot off the brake.

, These gauges display to the driver how much fuel the engine has left, how fast the car is going, how hot the engine is, and how many RPM (revolutions per minute) the engine is clocking.


The speedometer is probably the most important dashboard display in the car. It tells you how fast your car is traveling, in either miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per hour (kph).
The RPM gauge tells you how hard your engine is working. Most RPM gauges will have red areas starting at 6,000 or 7,000 RPM. When the dial in the gauge, travels into the red, learn to ease off the acceleration.
The fuel gauge tells you how much fuel your car has left. It usually has a dial, like the hand of a clock that travels between ""F"" and ""E,"" with ""E"" signaling ""empty"" and ""F"" signaling ""full."" Some more modern cars have digital fuel gauges; where electronic bars are displayed like the battery symbol on a mobile phone, and gradually decrease in quantity depending on how much fuel is in the car.
The temperature gauge in the car tells you whether your car's engine is overheating. It usually has a dial that travels between ""H"" and ""C,"" signaling ""hot"" and ""cold."" Your dial should normally be in the center of the gauge.

, In most places in the world, driving without wearing a seatbelt is illegal.Seatbelts greatly reduce the possibility of serious injury or death if you happen to be involved in an accident.

, When you turn it on, the car will move forward by itself if your foot isn't on the brake. With your foot on the brake in starting position, you're ready to start driving!

, Put your keys in the ignition, which is usually to the right side of the steering wheel, and turn clockwise. Note that in some newer vehicles, provided the keys are actually inside the car, all you need to do is push the ""Power"" or ""Ignition"" button for the engine to start. Fancy!

, If your car is parked in a car park or a driveway, chances are you're going to need to reverse your car out in order to begin driving. Although it may seem intimidating, there are only a couple of things for you to remember:


Put your car in Reverse and double-check. If your car isn't in Reverse, your car won't go backwards.
Look over your shoulder and turn your head to get a good view of where you're going.
Gently remove your foot from the brake pedal and do not put your foot on the accelerator. For your first couple of times backing out, don't worry about putting your foot on the accelerator. You can move your car simply by removing your foot from the brake. Your car will move slowly, but you won't risk accidentally running into something or someone.
Remember that the steering wheel is ""reversed"" in Reverse. When driving your car forward, if you turn the steering wheel to the right, your car will also turn to the right, and vice versa. This is because your wheels turn that way. When going in reverse, turning the steering wheel to the right will make your car turn to the left, while turning the steering wheel to the left will make your car turn to the right. Keep this in mind as you back your car out.
Use your brake whenever you need to slow down. Press your foot gently but firmly on the brake pedal to slow the car down if necessary.

, Put your foot on the brake pedal, shift your car into Drive so that it can begin to move forward, and then take your foot off the brake pedal. Slowly press down on the acceleration pedal with your foot to get the car to move forwards. Accelerate until you've reached the speed limit, and then take your foot off the accelerator, hovering it over the brake pedal in case you need to slow down.

, Imagine that the steering wheel is a clock. Place your left hand where the number 9 would be on a clock, and your right hand where the number 3 would be.Especially for beginners, do not try to hold the steering wheel with only one hand, because it is you are more likely to lose control of the car, which could cause an accident.

, Your blinkers are flashing orange lights or red, some cars have red lights as blinkers on either side of the rear of the car, next to the brake lights. They are really important when driving, as they let other cars know that you're wanting to switch lanes or turn in a specific direction. The blinker switch is located on the left-side of the steering wheel. Flick it up to indicate you want to turn right (for turning or switching lanes to the right), or flick it down to indicate you want to turn left (for turning or switching lanes to the left).

, Turning is quite easy once you get used to it. Like most things when driving, it's very intuitive. If you only need to turn the car slightly, turn the steering wheel in the direction you want to travel but try keeping your hands at the 9 and 3 position.

If you're making a harder turn, use the ""hand over hand"" method. Say you're turning right. Turn the steering wheel clockwise, leading with the right hand. When your right hand gets to the 4 or 5 position, release it and cross it over your left hand. Re-grip the wheel and continue turning.
To straighten out the car after a turn, simply loosen your grip in both hands and the steering wheel will automatically begin correcting itself. Apply more pressure to slow down the correction; apply less pressure to speed it up. Your hands should stay stationary as the steering wheel moves back to its original spot.

, At some point when driving, you'll need to switch from one lane to another, sometimes quickly. Doing so is easy, but you have to remember to indicate to let other drivers know that you're planning on switching lanes. Here are some things to keep in mind whilst switching lanes:

Indicate with your blinkers for at least two seconds before beginning to switch lanes. This lets other drivers know what you are planning to do.
Quickly scan your mirrors and look over your shoulder to check for any cars in your blind spot(s). Don't just rely on your mirrors to tell you where other cars are; use your eyes to quickly look for yourself before actually switching lanes.
Slowly move the car into the other lane. Turn your hands on the steering wheel ever so slightly in order to change lanes. It only takes a very slight movement of the wheel; as most modern cars are fitted with power steering. It should take anywhere from one to three seconds for you to change lanes. Any less and you're doing it too quickly; any more and you're doing it too slowly.

, How far you should stay behind the car in front of you depends on how fast you are traveling. You want to give yourself two to five seconds to react, depending on your comfort level. If the car in front of you were to abruptly come to a halt, at your current speed, would you have enough time to both react and calmly slow your car down without colliding into the car in front of you?


To judge this, watch as the car in front of you passes a fixed object on the road, like a billboard. As soon as the car passes that object, begin counting: one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.... How many seconds does it take for your car to pass the same object on the road?

, Driving defensively is a very important concept that too many drivers either take for granted or don't understand. Driving defensively will help save you money, ensure a pleasurable driving experience, and — most important — help you stay alive. Driving defensively is an umbrella term for several different concepts:



Don't assume that other road users will obey the rules, or pay attention, or be cautious. Rules of the road are enforced to make sure that everyone is safe. Often those rules are broken by selfish or clueless drivers. Don't assume that drivers will use their blinkers before they turn, for example. Don't assume that drivers will slow down for you to merge. Don't assume that drivers won't drive past red lights.

If you see a potentially dangerous situation, avoid it before it happens. Don't linger immediately to the right of a big semi-truck, for example. Don't try to pass a drunk driver who's swerving in and out of lanes.

Use all your senses to be aware, at all times, of what's happening on the road. Drivers often learn to tune out the rest of the world and ""get in the zone,"" simply because they've done the same thing hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Don't get too complacent behind the wheel. Use sight to monitor other cars' speeds and their habits. Use hearing to listen for car horns and the sounds of screeching. Use smell to be aware of burnt rubber or other caustic aromas that may indicate an accident.

, On highways, and to a lesser extent on streets, the leftmost lanes are usually reserved for faster traffic, while the rightmost lanes are reserved for slower traffic. It's rude (and dangerous) to tailgate someone going slower than you in the right lane. At the same time, it's selfish to hog the left lanes when you're going considerably slower than other traffic. Get in a lane that's going roughly your speed and stay there until you need to turn or leave the road.

, Because the general speed of traffic increases going right to left, it's important to pass on the left. You're speeding your car up and going faster than the car ahead of you, so you want to pass using a lane that's meant for faster cars. Follow this general rule of thumb even if its not a ""law"" where you drive! Remember: drive right, pass left.Try to never pass a truck on the right. Trucks and semis are far larger than normal cars, meaning that their blind spots are far bigger. Trucks often stay in the rightmost lanes and switch lanes to the right, rarely switching lanes to the left. Passing trucks on the left, therefore, means you're driving your car out of their territory, lowering your risk.

, Speed limits are there for a reason. They're not there to make driving less fun; they're there to make the road a safer place for all. Make sure that at most, you're only traveling 5 mph (8 km/h) faster than the speed limit. At least in America, police officers will rarely write a ticket for speeding if you're only traveling 5 mph (8 km/h) above the speed limit., When the weather acts up, tone it down a notch and drive even more defensively than normal. When it rains, for example, the water interacts with the oil on driving surfaces, making it very slick and slippery. In these conditions, it's hard for your tires to get good traction.In heavy rain, when small pools of water have accumulated on asphalt, you're especially at risk of hydroplaning.


Winter creates more difficult driving situations; with colder temperatures aswell as icy and snowy surfaces. Learn how to drive your car during the winter.

, Being courteous simply means acknowledging that there are other people using the road, each with his or her own agenda, and many of whom don't want to be stuck in their car. Make their life on the road a little easier if it's easy for you; the thought is that they'll pay it forward at some point, and you may be the beneficiary of their largesse.


Use your horn to alert other drivers, not to chide them. The horn is a powerful device. Use your horn when someone merges into your lane without seeing you, or when a light has turned green but they're still sitting idle. Don't use your horn because you're stuck in a traffic jam to express your frustration.
Use a wave to thank someone. When someone let's you into their lane, wave your hand to thank them. It doesn't take much effort, and it's a nice acknowledgement of ""thanks"" for keeping you in mind.
Don't disobey the rules of the road just in order to be courteous. This is important. If you stop at a four-way stop and you get there first, you're the one who gets to go first. Don't stop and let the person who got there after you go. It holds up efficiency and often creates confusion.

, Driving can be dangerous, and there sure are a lot of rules that you need to remember, but it's important to have fun while you're behind the wheel. Even while staying responsible, driving can be incredibly exhilarating. Just remember that the road doesn't belong to you alone and you should be fine.

, Parallel parking is when you have to back your car into a tight parking spot, usually a very complex maneuver. There are a couple tried and true tricks to parallel parking, which you can learn here. A very important part of urban driving.

, Merging onto a highway can be a difficult thing to do, especially if the traffic is denser than expected. The important thing to do here is to accelerate enough and judge whether you're going fast enough to fit safely between two cars.

, They may not be popular in America, but if you've ever driven outside the U.S., you'll know that they can be quite tricky. Often used instead of stop signs, roundabouts are efficient but need to be understood before conquered.

, Driving uphill can be a challenge, particularly if you're driving a manual car. Master the art of downshifting when going up a steep hill.

, With the rising cost of fuel, driving smart means more than just avoiding accidents. Those drivers who can save fuel while they drive ultimately have more money to spend on.

"
Determine when you need to up shift by the engine's speed.,
Begin the upshift process by removing your foot from the gas and depressing the clutch.,
Move the shift lever to the next highest gear.

,
Release the clutch and add the throttle.,
Put both hands back on the steering wheel.",How to Drive Smoothly with a Manual Transmission2," When your engine RPM starts to get above the normal range (about 2500-3000rpm commonly), you usually need to upshift.


Note that when you need to accelerate quickly or climb a hill, you should usually let the engine rev higher than when accelerating on a level surface or you'll 'lug' the engine which will lead to ignition timing problems.

, Make sure that clutch is fully depressed before moving the shift lever or you may grind the gears.

,, As with starting out, the clutch and throttle should be managed together to ensure a smooth shift, although generally when the car is already moving, you can release the clutch a little more quickly than when starting out.

,

Why? You will have better control of the vehicle if you're going round a corner.
When you change gear, you're pushing a selector fork against a rotating collar and you then push that collar into the gear you want to be in. If you hold the gear lever, you have a stationery object (the selector fork) that is being pushed against a spinning collar and you will wear out this selector fork due to the pressure being applied to it.

"
"
As with upshifting, you should use the engine's speed to determine when to downshift.,
Begin the downshift by removing your foot from the gas and depressing the clutch.,
Depress the clutch fully, then move the shift lever to the lower gear.

,
Slowly release the clutch.,
Release the clutch fully.

",How to Drive Smoothly with a Manual Transmission3," When your RPM start to get too low, you will feel the engine lag a bit, and the accelerator will become less responsive.


A common time you will need to downshift is after you have decelerated for a corner. In general, you should decelerate with the the brake before you enter the corner.
Once you have decelerated, downshift, and use the engine to pull you smoothly through the corner. Do not coast through corners, as this greatly reduces your ability to control the vehicle.

, You want to remove your foot from the gas a little ahead of the clutch movement to avoid the engine from revving up as the clutch releases.

,, This will begin to bring the engine up to speed. Gently use the gas pedal to match the engine's speed to that of the transmission.

,"
"
Leave the vehicle in gear, and begin braking.

,
Decelerate until the RPMs are just above idle.

,
Depress the clutch and bring the stick into a lower gear e.g.,
Continue braking normally until you are about to stop.

,
Just before you stop (usually less than a mile-per-hour) push the clutch in so you don't stall while continuing to brake.",How to Drive Smoothly with a Manual Transmission4,",, if you're close to a junction where you need to give way, put the car in 2 (often known as 2nd) and then you can release the clutch (to rest your foot and save wear on the clutch bearings).

,, If you're on a slope, apply the handbrake then release the brake pedal.

"
"
Brake as normal until you have almost come to a complete stop, then use the parking break to hold your car in place without rolling backwards.

,
When you are ready to take off again, release the clutch a little while gently applying the gas as you would do in method one above.

,
Once the car starts to ""bog down"" release the parking brake.

,
At this point the car should move forward, but it may take practice.",How to Drive Smoothly with a Manual Transmission5,",,, Continue to gradually let out the clutch while gently applying more gas until the clutch is all the way out.


The quicker you release the clutch the less wear, so the idea is to release the clutch as quickly as you can while still making your car move forward smoothly.

It's much more advisable to learn the rules before you get behind the wheel so you don't wing it and make mistakes as you go along. Here's how:
/images/thumb/7/7d/Drive-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7d/Drive-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg









Read the driver's handbook provided by the DMV or your local department that regulates driving and automobiles. If you do not learn the rules, you won't be able to get your permit.
Some basic rules and common sense safety precautions that everyone should know include: stopping for pedestrians, obeying traffic signs, staying within the speed limit, and wearing your seatbelt.;
, Your permit will allow you to drive with adult supervision and a curfew. Learn your state's laws to see what age you need to be to apply for a permit (typically between the ages of 14 and 18) and what you need to do to get it. Here are some general guidelines:
/images/thumb/d/d8/Drive-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d8/Drive-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg









If you're a minor, you'll need the signature of your parent or guardian.
You'll have to pass a written test about driving rules and regulation and safety on the road.
Some jurisdictions will require a certain number of hours of “behind-the-wheel” driver’s education in order to get your license.
If you are still in school, most will have classes in driver's education.

, Once you have your permit, you need to hone your driving skills. Before you take your car on the highway, you need to practice getting comfortable behind the wheel. Take it one day at a time and be patient. Nobody's a perfect driver at first. Here are some tips:
/images/thumb/4/42/Drive-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/4/42/Drive-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-3-preview-Version-2.jpg









Practice with an adult that you trust. Drive with a responsible driver over the age of 21 who can guide you and give you advice without getting frustrated.
Practice in an isolated and safe location, such as an empty parking lot on the weekends. This will help you understand the way your car accelerates, how your brakes work, and how to generally maneuver your car. Each car is different and it's important to get a feel for what makes your car unique.

, Before you start driving, it's important to adjust your mirrors and seat so that you are ready for the road. Doing this before you drive instead of while you're driving will ensure that you're being safe and focused. Here's what to do:
/images/thumb/3/35/Drive-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-513px-Drive-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/35/Drive-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-4-preview-Version-2.jpg









Check your rearview and side mirrors and make any necessary adjustments. Make sure you have a good view of the cars on either side and behind you. Do not adjust your mirrors while driving---this can be far too distracting.

, Before you put your hands on the wheel, it's important that your body and car are ready to venture out onto the roads. Here's what you should do:
/images/thumb/2/28/Drive-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/2/28/Drive-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg









Fasten your seatbelt. Depending on where you live, there is most likely a law that requires you wear a seatbelt. Not only will you get cited for breaking this rule, but your chances of injury and fatality during a collision also increase exponentially.
Check your dashboard. Make sure your car is ready to drive and that there are no alarming lights that signal that your car needs to be taken to the shop.
Adjust your seat, making sure you can comfortably reach the pedals and see the road.

, To be safe, you should minimize any distractions before you put your foot to the pedal. Eliminate any obstacles that will keep you from focusing on the road. Here are some tips:
/images/thumb/e/e3/Drive-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e3/Drive-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg









Put away your cell phone. Don't get behind the wheel if you're in the middle of an intense texting session with your best friend. Finish the conversation by saying you're going to drive and will talk later. You can even turn off your phone if you're prone to distractions.
Turn down your music. Put on something soothing and relaxing to get you focused.
If you need to brush your hair or put on makeup, do not do this while driving--get everything you need to do done before you put the keys in the ignition.

, To start your car, you have to follow a few easy steps in the right order. Here's what you do:
/images/thumb/0/08/Drive-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/0/08/Drive-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg









Release your emergency brake.
Put your foot on the brake.
Put your key in the ignition and turn it. You should hear it turning on.

, Since you are learning on an automatic, this will either be (D) Drive or (R) Reverse, depending on how you are parked.
/images/thumb/c/c4/Drive-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c4/Drive-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg









If you're driving forward, you should put your car in Drive.
If you're driving backward, in order to back out of a driveway or a parking spot, your car should be in Reverse.
If reversing, first check your rearview mirror and then place your hand on the passenger seat as you turn your head to the right to look behind you.

, Congratulations--you are driving a car!
/images/thumb/0/09/Drive-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/0/09/Drive-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg









Slowly apply your foot to the gas to accelerate.

, You should accelerate your car to reach the speed limit in your neighborhood. If you're on the highway, you should be aware of the speed limit but go with the flow of traffic.
/images/thumb/b/b4/Drive-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b4/Drive-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg









If all the cars around you are going much slower than the speed limit due to traffic, drive accordingly to avoid crashing into them.
If all of the cars around you are driving much faster than the speed limit, you don't have to break the law, but you can accelerate a bit so you don't slow the flow down too much.
Remember that driving too slow can be just as dangerous as driving too fast.
Accelerate your car calmly. Don't push your foot too hard on the gas or you may go much faster than you intended. Know that each car has its own acceleration rate.

, Proper steering techniques will make your driving experience smoother and will help you avoid collisions. Steering your car the right way can help you turn and position in your car in the most convenient way. Here are some tips for good steering:
/images/thumb/7/75/Drive-Step-11-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-11-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/75/Drive-Step-11-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-11-preview-Version-2.jpg









Make sure to have both hands on the wheel.
Place your hands at either 8 or 4 o’clock, or slightly higher at 9 and 3 o’clock, depending on your preference. At this position, you can safely maneuver the wheel and are prevented from making any sharp turns.
When making a turn, pull down on the side of the wheel you wish to turn towards and push up with opposite hand. This is called “pull-push” steering.
To make sharper turns at lower speeds, use hand-over-hand turning. To do this, perform a push-pull turn but bring your pull hand over your push hand in order to continue moving the wheel in the desired direction., You should know how long it takes for your car to reach a full and complete stop when traveling at various speeds.
/images/thumb/1/10/Drive-Step-12-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-12-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/1/10/Drive-Step-12-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-12-preview-Version-2.jpg









Always drive at least a car length behind the car in front of you. If you have to make a fast stop, you do not want to crash into the front car.
When traveling at a faster speed, you will need even more than one car length in order to come safely to a stop, so understand and observe the two-second rule, which states that you should be at least two seconds behind any car directly in front of you to keep a safe following distance. Take weather and road conditions into account.
Try not to stop suddenly unless it’s an emergency. Sudden stops can lead to vehicles behind you plowing into your rear.

, Remember that the person in the car behind you cannot read your mind. They don't know which direction you are going to move unless you signal.You should signal in the following situations:
/images/thumb/b/b7/Drive-Step-13-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-13-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b7/Drive-Step-13-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-13-preview-Version-2.jpg









As you approach the last 100 feet (30.5 m) before your turning point (left or right turn).
Before you change lanes, be sure that you signal at least 5 seconds prior.
Before pulling into or out from a curbside parking spot.
When changing directions.

, Your car lights can help you see more clearly and avoid danger. You should use them when it's dark, raining, or foggy.
/images/thumb/b/be/Drive-Step-14-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-14-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/be/Drive-Step-14-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-14-preview-Version-2.jpg









A general rule of thumb is if you have to ask yourself, ""Should my lights be on right now?"" then the answer is always yes.
Check the other cars on the road. If most of them turn their lights on, flick yours on too.
Remember that some cars have lights that automatically turn on and off under certain conditions. If you don't have one of these types of cars, make sure to turn your lights off when you park your car, or you may drain your battery.

, Learn how your windshield wipers work before the first drop of rain falls. You can adjust them to move back and forth at different speeds depending on how hard the rain is falling.
/images/thumb/8/80/Drive-Step-15-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-15-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/8/80/Drive-Step-15-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-15-preview-Version-2.jpg









You can also use your wipers to squirt fluid on your windshield to wipe off any dirt or stains.

Do not drive if your wipers are broken. Driving in a storm without wipers is incredibly dangerous.

, Follow the rules for properly and safely changing lanes. A useful mnemonic device to follow is S.M.O.G./images/thumb/6/61/Drive-Step-16-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-16-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/61/Drive-Step-16-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-16-preview-Version-2.jpg









S: SIGNAL to let the cars around you know that you intend to change lanes.
M: Check your MIRROR to see that it is clear.
O: Check OVER-THE-SHOULDER to again make sure that it is safe to proceed.
G: GO.

, After you've reached your destination, you'll need to turn off your engine and park your car safely. Here's how to finish driving:
/images/thumb/5/59/Drive-Step-17-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-17-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/5/59/Drive-Step-17-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-17-preview-Version-2.jpg









Find a good parking spot, and stop your car by putting your foot on the brake.
Shift gears into ""Park.""
Turn off your engine.
Pull up your parking brake.
If your lights are on, turn them off.
Lock your car to prevent theft.
Get out of the car and make sure it fits in its spot.

, Though the differences between the cars will be discussed, there are many basic rules that still apply to both types of cars. They are:
/images/thumb/9/9e/Drive-Step-18-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-18-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/9e/Drive-Step-18-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-18-preview-Version-2.jpg









The steps you should take to prepare for driving, such as adjusting your mirrors and avoiding distractions.
The rules of signaling appropriately.
The rules of changing lanes.
Using your lights and wipers when needed.
The placement of your hands on the wheel.

, Most people will agree that the manual car is trickier to drive than the automatic because of the extra steps that need to be taken to drive successfully. However, many people also say that driving a manual car can be more fun and rewarding, because you'll be more involved in the driving process. If you have a manual car, you should recognize and use two extra controls. They are:
/images/thumb/9/98/Drive-Step-19-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-19-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/98/Drive-Step-19-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-19-preview-Version-2.jpg










The clutch: The clutch controls the connection between the engine and transmission. Pushing on the clutch pedal disengages the clutch and disconnects the engine from the transmission. Releasing will engage the clutch and connect them. When disengaging the clutch you effectively place the car in neutral regardless of whether it is in gear or not. Engaging the clutch will place the car into whichever gear is currently selected.

The shifter: Shifting gears is done by moving a stick called either the gear stick, shift stick, gearshift, gear lever, gear selector, or shifter. Gear numbers and shift patterns will vary by model but the “default” position is “N” neutral, followed by gears that range from 1 to 5 or 1 to 6, and then “R” reverse.

, Starting your manual car is a bit trickier than starting an automatic car. It will also take more practice. When you're starting out, make sure you're in an isolated location to prevent any mishaps. Here's how to do it:
/images/thumb/d/d2/Drive-Step-20-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-20-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d2/Drive-Step-20-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-20-preview-Version-2.jpg









Begin by stepping on the clutch. Most manual cars will not start unless the clutch is disengaged.
Once you have started the car, place your foot on the brake and release the emergency brake.
If moving forward, place the car into 1st gear. If reversing, place the car into reverse (""R"").
As you slowly release the clutch, slowly apply pressure onto the gas pedal.
You will hear the engine revving up and then feel and hear the clutch “catch.” If the car moves forward without the engine stalling, then great work! You have successfully started the car and are traveling in 1st gear.

, Shift gears just as you would from Neutral to 1st gear in order to move into the higher gears. Before you start switching gears, remember these points:
/images/thumb/a/ab/Drive-Step-21-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-21-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/a/ab/Drive-Step-21-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-21-preview-Version-2.jpg









You must shift gears in this order. Disengage the clutch by pressing on the clutch pedal. Shift gears using the shifter. Re-engage the clutch by slowly taking pressure off the clutch pedal while stepping on the gas.
Think of the clutch pedal and gas pedal as being proportionate to the other in pressure. They should act in concert together in the same way that a seesaw behaves. When one goes up, the other goes down.
Gradually applying gas while engaging the clutch will make shifting gears smoother. It will take time, but once you master the feeling of the clutch and gas, it will become second nature.

, Each car will have its own speed range for each gear. Some will tell you to only switch gears after reaching a certain RPM.
/images/thumb/9/99/Drive-Step-22-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-22-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/99/Drive-Step-22-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-22-preview-Version-2.jpg









Listen to your car and switch when you think the engine needs to make the change.

, Press on the clutch pedal and move into Neutral when braking. Moving the car into Neutral will ensure that the engine is no longer moving the transmission and prevents you from stalling as you decelerate with the brake.
/images/thumb/b/b8/Drive-Step-23-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-23-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b8/Drive-Step-23-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-23-preview-Version-2.jpg









You can potentially save gas and improve the life of your brakes by downshifting to decelerate. This takes practice however, so begin by just using your brakes.

, Once you've found the right place to park your car, it's important to follow a few key rules to park your manual car properly. Here's what you should do:
/images/thumb/4/43/Drive-Step-24-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-24-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/4/43/Drive-Step-24-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-24-preview-Version-2.jpg









Leave your car in gear, not Neutral. It'll typically be in either reverse or first gear. If you leave it in Neutral, it won't stay put.
Take your keys out of the ignition.

, Once you've gotten your permit, have mastered either the automatic or manual car, and have driven on the road for the requisite amount of time (six months in some states), then you are ready to get your driver's license! The driver's license will allow you to drive alone, at any hour, and with more than one other person in the car. To get the license, there are a few things you may have to do, depending on your state:
/images/thumb/3/30/Drive-Step-25-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-25-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/30/Drive-Step-25-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-25-preview-Version-2.jpg









Pass a written test.
Pass a short driving test, which will test you on basic driving skills which include how to parallel park and make K-turns.
Pass a vision test.
Check out your state's DMV requirements to see exactly how old you have to be and what you have to do to get a license.

, Once you've done everything you need to do to get your license, you should remember to be a cautious, safe, or responsible driver. If you don't drive by the rules, your driving privileges will be revoked and you may get in trouble with the law. Here are some things to keep in mind once you're a licensed driver:
/images/thumb/e/e4/Drive-Step-26-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Drive-Step-26-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e4/Drive-Step-26-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Drive-Step-26-preview-Version-2.jpg









Always put safety first. Safety should be your priority over fun. Don't do anything that compromises your safety like cram seven people in your car, drive without a seatbelt, or be a generally distracted driver.
Your driving skills could always be improved. Make notes of things you want to work on, from making smooth turns to signaling ahead of time, and work to address your driving flaws.
Keep your passengers safe. Make sure your passengers are behaving appropriately before you start the car. If they are hanging out of windows, not wearing seatbelts, or not respecting the roads, don't start the car.

Further, many countries do not recognize other country’s licenses. However, most do recognize an International Driving Permit.The best source of information regarding licensing in the country you plan to visit is the embassy of that country.;
, The minimum driving age in many countries is 18. This applies whether or not you are licensed in your home country. One the other end of the age spectrum, some countries also have an maximum age limit. These limits are generally 70 or 75, and exist in countries including Ireland and Romania.In Africa, for instance, most countries require drivers to be 18. However, Zambia and Zimbabwe allow drivers as young as 16. In South Africa you have to 17, and in Niger, you have to be 23.
Drivers can be as young as 14 in the U.S. and Canada, though most North American countries - and around the world, for that matter - have a minimum driving age between 16 and 18.

As such, it not only serves as a license, but as a valid form of identification in the vast majority of the world’s countries.In order to get an IDP, you will likely need to have a current driver’s license in your home country.
Be sure to get your IDP only from an approved organization. In the U.S., these organizations are AAA and AATA.
The easiest way to get an IDP in the U.S. is fill out the online application, print it out, and bring it to an insurance office that sells AAA. You will also need 2 passport photos, which you can likely purchase at the office. There is also a $20 permit fee.

, Most insurance policies will not cover you while driving abroad. While you may be covered in a country neighboring your own, never assumed this is the case. The best way to make sure you’re protected from both financial and legal penalties is by contacting your insurance company directly.If necessary, they will provide information about how to extend your coverage. This will often include a fee or temporary increase in insurance premiums. If you’re renting a car, you will likely want to purchase insurance through them. See the corresponding section in this article.

, If you are insured in a European country, get a Green Card. These are free with your coverage, and provide you with proof of insurance that is valid in most European countries. You can likely print your green card from your insurance issuer’s website, with the option to upgrade for additional coverage while driving abroad., Many countries will allow you to get a license in your new country of residence more easily if you already have a current driver’s license in the country you’re leaving. Some will simply allow you to “transfer” your license to drive, though you will probably need to pay some fees for your new license.


Many countries require you to get a new license within a certain period of time. Visit a government website to check on the time frame in the country you’re moving to.

, In addition to licensing and insurance, you may need additional paperwork to travel in certain areas or use specific roads. Prevent legal complications by checking for any additional permits or other paperwork you may need.For example, some countries require emergency gear such as cones and reflective vests in all vehicles.Divided highways sometimes have different regulations than other roads. For instance, in some countries, many highways require you to pay a toll, while others may require a specific permit.

, If you're traveling or moving abroad and intend to drive, this will likely increase the amount of preparation you'll need to do. For instance, it may take a while to acquire or update your license and insurance to meet specific requirements in your destination country. To ensure that you're fully prepared, look into this information at least a month or two before arriving.

Study the Driver's Handbook.,
Observe how Americans drive.,
Realize that there is a flow.,
Know when to brake.,
Know your limits.,
Be defensive.,
Copy the best.,
Signal correctly.,
Think like a driver.,
Don't be an aggressive driver.",How to Improve Your American Driving Skills," You had to pass a test to get the license, and maybe your English wasn't very good. Go back and read it again, carefully. Memorize it if you have to.;
, Everyone drives differently of course, but there are patterns and there are good drivers and bad ones. Pay attention and learn which ones are driving well.

, We follow traffic laws here and that means traffic moves in a predictable flow or pattern. People drive by assuming that all drivers know the pattern and follow it. When you drive counter to this assumption, you surprise people, and that makes you dangerous. This includes entering freeways, where you must get up to speed fast, not stop and wait.

, Of course, you must brake at a stop sign or light, or when traffic stops in front of you. But many drivers brake when they shouldn't, and that confuses other drivers around you. You should normally not brake


when driving at speed on a non-city road or freeway. This means look ahead to see how the cars in front of you are moving, and when there is a slow-down, you slow also before you have to suddenly brake. If you leave enough space between your car and the ones in front, you shouldn't brake at all.
in normal traffic when cars are flowing smoothly. Don't keep your foot on or above the brake pedal ""just in case"", because that makes the brake lights come on and now people wonder why you are stopping.

, If you are afraid to drive as fast as people usually drive on a freeway, or on a mountainous curved road, don't do it. Don't slow other people down behind you because you are afraid to follow the normal speed and habits. Find another road.

, Many Americans don't do this, and they cause and suffer accidents. They need to learn the same thing. Act as if every other driver near you is too stupid to drive correctly. Give them extra room and time. Decide what you would do if they suddenly got in your way. Have a way out; that is, where would you steer your car if you have to move out of the way fast.

, Don't copy poor drivers to who speed, drive close behind other cars, drive through yellow traffic lights, etc.

, Signaling means you indicate where you will move BEFORE you do it, not while or after you do it. Signal for at least 5 blinks of the light before changing lanes, or turning a corner. Show people what you are doing so they don't get in your way. Two cars can't be in the same space at the same time.

, In this country, driving is NOT like riding a bicycle back home. If your country has small slow roads, lots of bicycles, carts, or walkers, animals, horses, etc. then you have to think differently. You can't suddenly realize you made a mistake and turn around like a bicycle can. You can't stop and decide what you're going to do on the road. You must be ready to drive before you get on the road.

, In Europe you may be used to high speed driving on open motorways. We do have speed limits here, and we're not used to road racing, like in Monte Carlo (though some drivers fantasize about this). In fact, we seldom drive high performance cars and aren't used to tight turns and other racing techniques. Just because we have whole states of open freeways (think Nevada), this doesn't mean you are on a racecourse.

Check with your credit card company about insurance.,
Ask the rental company’s employee any specific questions.,
Plan a specific return time and location.",How to Find Information About Driving Abroad2," In addition to checking with your insurance company directly, contact your credit card company as well. Many major credit card companies include insurance coverage for rental cars. If they do, use your card to reserve your rental and receive these benefits.Ask your credit card company about what is and isn’t covered, and consider adding to the coverage through the car rental company
Be aware that some countries require coverage for theft, which you pay to the rental car company., For instance, ask if anything specific is required to drive along the route you’ll be taking, or if there is any additional information you should know. Further, ask about whether you can take the vehicle into other countries.Simply say something along the lines of, “Will my insurance cover me if I cross an international border?”
It’s best to share your anticipated itinerary with the rental car company to prevent unexpected fines or a potential lack of coverage.

, There are a few assumptions about renting a car that you should avoid. Perhaps foremost, do not assume you can return the vehicle at any time, or in any location. Some rental companies will charge you a fee for returning a vehicle outside of certain hours, or for returning it to an unspecified location.Additionally, do not assume the cheapest option is the best. For one - it will likely be a manual transmission. If you do not know how to drive a stick shift, don’t assume you’ll be able to learn while driving abroad.

Visit the destination country’s government website.,
Check your own country’s recommendations.,
Be aware of strict laws in some places.",How to Find Information About Driving Abroad3," Check to see if there is a webpage for foreign travelers about driving in the country you’re visiting. Many countries in Europe, for instance, will have information available online about specific driving rules and regulations. Since these webpages are designed for foreign visitors, they will often be available in multiple languages.


You own country’s embassy websites can also helpful. Visit the website for your country’s embassy that is located in the country you’re looking for information on. If information is not forthright, there will likely be contact information on the website.

, Your own government’s recommendations about driving abroad can also be helpful. In particular, these websites will contain information about driving practices that you are used to, but that are uncommon in other parts of the world.


This will be especially helpful when visiting a neighboring country. When travel between the two countries is common, you will be able to find plenty of information on government webpages.

, While you already know you should never drink and drive, it’s important to recognize that the legal blood alcohol content to operate a motor vehicle in many countries is very low. In some countries, such as Japan and Czech Republic, you can get into serious legal trouble for driving with any alcohol in your system at all.Your country’s embassy in your destination country is the best source of information on unique driving rules and regulations.
Other countries, such as Italy and France, will fine you for not wearing a seat belt on the spot. Prevent this by always wearing your seat belt.
Finally, some European cities have outlawed using your horn unless it is an emergency. While horn use is both popular and common in some countries, it is heavily frowned upon in others.

Recognize that US drivers' abilities and skills are as diverse as its culture.,
Keep off rural roads at night.,
Be very careful passing and changing lanes, as you might meet another driver who isn't as careful.,
Take care with turns.,
Watch those one-way roads.,
Americans have a strong respect for lanes.",How to Drive in the USA Without Getting Into Trouble," Do not assume that other drivers will act the same. People often drive while using cell phones, read maps, eat, drink or groom themselves while driving and are often not aware of other vehicles. Learn defensive driving techniques. Abrupt lane changes are not uncommon in areas popular with tourists and visitors.;
, In rural areas avoid driving on the highway at night, as you might run in to animals (fairly common), cars with no lights (somewhat common), drunks behind the wheel (common on weekends) or people just walking around on the side of the road (uncommon). Drunks in traffic is a problem, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. There is also a strange habit of young people sitting on the curb with legs sprawled onto the road - be aware as they will play chicken and will not move for you. The law might not side with you if you run over idiotic teenager's legs.

, Flashing your high beams at a slower driver in front of you is illegal in most states and will only irritate the other driver. A left turn signal from the car in front of you doesn't necessarily mean you can pass. Be extra careful when you want to turn left and make sure nobody tries to pass you.

, In many downtown metropolitan zones, do not turn left onto a street in the middle of a block, the only way out of a parking lot in such a place is to turn right and go around the block.

, Also in many downtown metropolitan areas, be careful of one-way roads. Look to see what direction the parked cars are facing before you turn.

, Not respecting lanes is a good way to get into an accident and provoke the ire of the police and other drivers. This doesn't mean they will stay in one lane, however. Often (especially in metropolitan areas) they will abruptly change lanes, but straddling lanes is taboo.

Drive on the right side of the road.,
Get a license.,
Don't drive over the speed limit.,
Drive in the extreme right lane if you are traveling slower than other traffic; be alert for traffic exiting and entering the road, particularly if the right side is not curbed.,
Use turn signal/indicators in the direction you want to go when changing lanes, turning, and waiting at signals, etc.

,
Keep in mind that women can't drive in this area.",How to Drive in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," The steering wheel is on the left side like in the US and most countries.;
, You will need to pass a reverse or parallel parking test. It doesn't matter which type of car you get, manual or automatic transmission.

, Although very common, it is being enforced; there are cops with speed cameras almost everywhere. Undercover cops are also very common on highways, usually a white lumina, crown Victoria, or corolla with flashers hid behind the tinted glass, and sometimes they have police bumpers.

, Pass on the left.

,, It's illegal and/or culturally unacceptable for women to drive a car in Saudi Arabia. However, the government is working on making women able to drive.

If possible, have someone else drive for awhile until you are used to how people drive in the area.,
If you drive a car with a manual transmission, prepare for a leg workout if you get caught in rush hour bumper-to-bumper traffic.,
Follow some basic rules of thumb.,
Always use your signal for turning and changing lanes.,
If you realize you aren't in the correct lane for a turn at an intersection, don't try to turn anyway.,
If you see someone signaling that they need to get into your lane, slow down a bit and give them room.,
If someone signals to change lanes from your lane to another lane, DO NOT try to crowd them out by passing them on that side before they can switch lanes.,
Another issue that is common sense, but seems to often be forgotten, is that when there is more than one lane in one direction, you turn right only from the rightmost lane and left only from the leftmost lane unless otherwise marked.,
If you wave to people, don't be offended if they don't wave back.,
Don't be too upset if someone flips you off.,
Enjoy your drive!

",How to Drive in a Metropolitan Area if You're from the Country," Driving in a highly populated metropolitan area is very different from those dirt roads out in the country where no one is around. Try to notice how people drive, what habits people seem to have, and what people do in response to certain situations.;
, Unfortunately bumper-to-bumper traffic is often stop-and-go instead of moving along at a stead slow pace.

, First of all, go the speed of traffic. It is very dangerous to be going 35 mph (56 km/h) on the interstate when everyone else is going 70 -- plus it blocks traffic up, and people won't thank you for it.

, Other drivers can't read your mind -- they have to rely on things like your turn signal to know what you're going to do. If you are turning, put on your signal about 10 car lengths before you plan to turn. Always use your signal when you're changing lanes, and check, double-check, and triple-check to make sure there is a spot open before you change lanes.

, This is common sense; it is safer to go on another block and turn around, and it's not going to cost you more than a minute or two.

, Not only is it rude to try to speed up to pass them, it can also be dangerous.

, It is EXTREMELY rude, and you could find yourself in a rear-end collision, which would be YOUR fault.

, This is common sense and it can mean the difference between a preventable wreck or a safe commute.

, Everyone is trying to get to some different place, and people are usually more preoccupied with their own lives than looking at other drivers.

, If they do, try to figure out what you may have done that prompted it and try to change this behavior. Realize that the person may have just been having a bad day, and let it go.

Remember to drive on the left side of the road.,
Learn the language.,
Remember that the majority of cars in the UK are manual transmission.,
Always give way to the right, not the left like in the USA or continental European countries.

,
Make any necessary modifications to your headlights to adjust the beam to avoid dazzling oncoming drivers if your car is from a country that normally drives on the right side of the road.,
Never drink alcohol, or use drugs and drive.,
If stopped by the police, wait for instructions before doing anything.,

Be aware that fuel prices in the UK are almost three times higher than in the USA, and hiring a car may also cost more.,
Be aware that in some cities, there are bus lanes (Indicated by road signs, the words ""BUS LANE"" in large letters across the road, and occasionally the tarmac will be colored red).",How to Drive in the UK," If you drive on the right you will likely involved in a serious collision, or killed, and will be arrested for dangerous driving which is a criminal offense and may end up with a custodial sentence.;
, Bonnet, boot, windscreen, tyre, bumper, gearstick, mobile, car hire, roundabout, motorway, A-road, B-road, RTA, slip road, dual carriageway ...make sure you know what these mean before driving on UK roads.

, If you cannot drive a manual car, you will have to hire an automatic car because you will not be qualified to drive or insured to drive a manual car. If you have an accident whilst driving a manual that you cannot operate, you may be arrested for dangerous driving which can result in a heavy fine and maybe a custodial sentence.

,, Often, there are adhesive or static shields that can be applied to the headlamps. Some cars even have a simple mechanism under the bonnet for adjusting the beam pattern.

, The UK has very strict drink and drugs regulations and many police officers pull over cars to carry out drink and drug tests on random drivers. The view of the police and the courts is that alcohol immediately makes you guilty in an accident, even if it was not your fault. Refusing to provide a breath or urine sample when asked to do so is an offence itself, and will result in your arrest.

, Always do as you're told without a bad attitude and never assume that if you are polite you will get off any offense you have committed. Always provide ID when asked. You should always carry a valid drivers licence and proof of vehicle insurance when you drive. It is a criminal offense to refuse or give false details which will result in arrest. Unlike in the USA and maybe other countries, the UK police do not need permission or a reason to stop and search you, your belongings (handbag, rucksack or pockets) or your vehicle if stopped while driving. Do not attempt to stop them as you will be detained or arrested.

, In the UK, the left hand lane is considered the ""slow lane"" and some drivers may pull over without checking properly which can cause an accident. Be aware that using the hard shoulder of a motorway to undertake vehicles will also result in a possible arrest.

, These are fixed cameras, mobile speed traps and are also fixed to most police vehicles. These automatic systems in police cars can also confirm whether or not the vehicle is insured or not.

, Always make sure you have the correct motor insurance policy, failure to do so will result in your vehicle being seized and you being arrested. Make sure the vehicle is road legal to UK standards, failure to do so will void any insurance policy and result in the vehicle being seized. If driving a friend's vehicle always get their permission and check your own insurance policy to make sure you are permitted to drive other vehicles.

, The speed limits on the motorways are 60mph (96km/h) for goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, 60mph (96km/h) for buses and coaches and 70mph (112km/h) for cars. , Image

, Only public buses, taxis, motorcycles, bicycles and emergency service vehicles are permitted to use this lane. Anyone else will be photographed (automatic cameras) and fined £60 for using this lane. (Approximately $100 USD).

Use the same steps when you go back home.",How to Adjust to Driving a Car on the Right Side of the Road," Some countries have different road rules and road signs, so it's important to know what you're doing before you get on the road. Study up on the areas that you plan on traveling to, and get well-acquainted with their rules of the road before driving in that country., Before you leave, study the area you'll be traveling in. Get to know the surrounding attractions on each route you take. It'll be harder to get lost if you can remember some key points of interest that can keep you headed in the right direction.

, Make sure you have your map on-hand at all times when driving in another country. A GPS is a convenient way to get around, but may have poor signal in some areas., Purchase headlamp converters to ensure your headlights are adjusted for driving on the right. Make sure you buy ones that have clear instructions and are easy to remove. Follow the instructions on the package when putting the stickers on the headlights., Label a sticky note with the words “Drive on the Right” so you remember to stay on the right when you drive. Drivers get so used to driving on one side of the road that it's easy to fall into the routine of driving on that side. You wouldn't want to forget to drive on the right side of the road, as that could lead to accidents., Keep a list of reliable people or companies you can call to help you if your car breaks down. This way, you won't have to ask people you don't know who might speak a different language for help. Consider applying for insurance that will cover your car if it breaks down in the country you're in., In countries where one drives on the right-hand side of the road, the cars are built so that the driver sits on the left-hand side of the car instead of the right. Also, changing gears is done with the opposite hand.


No matter what country you're in, the pedals will always be in the same position from left to right., Before you drive on a public road, practice driving on the right-hand side and parking in a designated car park so you can build up some confidence before you go on the road. You'll find that you're more prepared and more accustomed to this different way of driving when you start to drive on public roads. Without practice, it's possible to become distracted by trying to remember how to drive on the right., If you get confused, take a moment to look at the road signs around you. If they're facing you, you're going in the correct direction — that is, unless the signs read ""Wrong Way"" or ""Do Not Enter""!


Oncoming traffic is seen coming from the left.

Left-turning traffic must cross oncoming traffic.
Traffic signs facing motorists are mostly on the right-hand side of the road.

, Because you are a new learner, keep in mind that the ""fast"" lane is the left lane and the ""slow"" lane is the right lane, which is the opposite of what you're used to. (In both cases, however, it is the lane farthest from the oncoming traffic.) Let fast drivers pass on your left.


When you need to pass other drivers, give a left turn signal, move to the left, pass, signal right, and move in front.

, Check your mirrors for pedestrians and be aware of your surroundings at all times. Normally, pedestrians are supposed to be walking on their left hand side of the road, facing traffic, but human nature applies here, as in your home country: they can be anywhere., Make sure the cars in front of you are farther ahead of you than you're used to. This way, you'll have more time to react to their driving.Stay four to five seconds behind the car in front of you, just like you would do when it's raining or snowing., Get used to the counterclockwise rotation of roundabouts in places where you drive on the right side of the road. Remember to give the right of way to the left. Drive through roundabouts slower than what you're used to., Signal in plenty of time to let other drivers know what you are doing, and make any necessary adjustments. Be sure to check all mirrors before turning or changing lanes.


Make a left turn by getting as close as possible to the left-most lane, nearest the median strip (in a divided road) or the center of the road (when oncoming traffic is immediately adjacent). When completing your turn, you will cross traffic going opposite your original direction and traffic going opposite your intended direction. Be sure you end up in the right half of any two-way road, but in the left lane (if there is more than one).
To make a right hand turn, stay close to the curb or the edge of the road and do not cross any traffic when completing your turn.

, Driving in unfamiliar territory can be exhausting and stressful. Taking regular breaks will allow you to take a minute to relax before you get on the road again., You'll need to get used to driving on the left side of the road again once you get back home. These steps should help with the adjustment back to your regular driving routine."

Look for tractor safety issues.,
Check your tractor's tire pressure.,
Inspect your stabilizer chains to ensure they are properly secured.,
Open the hood of your tractor.,
Be safe at all times.,
Climb up into the tractor's seat.,
Press the clutch pedal down to the floor with your left foot.,
Engage the break with your right foot.,
To drive, release the tractor's parking break.,
Slowly lift your foot off the clutch.,
Maintain a uniformly slow speed.,
To stop the tractor, press the clutch to the floor completely.,
Make sure all operators are trained and familiar with the tractor.,

Use cultivator attachments on larger tractors to plow for planting.,
Make sure any attachments heavier than the tractor itself have independent brakes.,
Hitch all attachments properly.",How to Drive a Tractor," Walk around your tractor doing an inspection before climbing on. Loose wheel lugs, nuts or bolts may need periodic tightening.;
, Low pressure in one or more tires may cause instability and create a safety hazard. If you're not driving your tractor every day, make it a routine to give the tires a quick once-over so you know they're in good shape before you get way out in a field.

, Do this when your tractor attachments are behind the tractor., Check the cooling system, radiator and battery levels to make sure they are in the proper range.Make sure you have enough oil and fuel to complete the job or task at hand.

, Wear good-quality boots with gripping soles, and keep any long hair tied back. Avoid dangling jewelry that could become caught in moving machinery, and avoid wearing loose or baggy clothing while operating a tractor. Always climb into the tractor using the proper hand holds.

, Familiarize yourself with the controls and find the clutch. Set the seat so you can reach the steering wheel, throttle, and other controls easily with your hands and feet.


Wear your seatbelt any time you're going to be around other vehicles. In the field, while it may seem like common sense to buckle your safety belt, you'll find almost no farmers strapping themselves in. More likely than an accident in your tractor will be the need to quickly turn off the engine and hop out and do something that needs doing. The safety roll bar will help to prevent serious injury. Practice good tractor safety and drive safely.

, You want to be sure the transmission is in neutral as you turn it over.

, Turn the key forward to start the engine. When it turns over, drop the throttle slightly (without killing it) to let the engine warm up a little. If you jump straight from turning it over to driving, you'll likely stall.

, Continue holding the clutch to the tractor floor and put the transmission into a first gear.

, Just as with any manual transmission, you want to be slow and smooth as you let the clutch out. It's a lot easier since you don't have to be actively pushing the gas. Keep the throttle at a low setting and take your foot off the brake.

, Tractors aren't made for going particularly fast, they're made for durability and power. Don't push it. Go slowly, treating turns, curves, and hills with special caution.


Especially if you're using attachments and other hardware, go extremely slowly and use precaution when executing turns.

, Switch the gears to neutral and set the parking brake. Slow the throttle. Turn the tractor key to the off position to stop the tractor engine.

, For farm hands or employees younger than 16, familiarize yourself with OSHA labor standards regarding child labor. Some jobs involving heavy machinery are too dangerous to be performed by less experienced workers.


""HO/A #1 The FLSA prohibits youth under 16 years of age from operating a tractor of over 20 PTO (power-take-off) horsepower, and from connecting or disconnecting implements or parts to such a tractor.""In some places, it's necessary to obtain a registration to drive your tractor on the road (the UK and Australia, for example) while many other regions forego registration as long as your tractor displays reflective caution tape and is clearly visible.

, For heavy-duty weed control and maintenance of rough areas of your property, it's useful to get a mowing attachment to eliminate invasive weeds and brush.

, Most Kubotas and other common smaller tractors have a wide variety of attachments, including buckets that will make your tractor into a kind of small-scale backhoe. You can haul brush and other junk around your property.


Follow proper driving safety when adding a bucket. Never drive with the bucket in full ""up"" position, but always remember to raise it into the drive position so it's not dragging in the mud.

, If you've got a row to hoe, the job is much easier with a cultivator to break up the dirt and help plant your crop.

, If you're using tractor attachments, you'll need to be especially careful to drive extremely carefully and use the guidelines outlined in the owner's manual for each implement, attachment, or device. Make sure that heavier attachments are outfitted with independent brakes in good working condition, and learn to use them.

, Make sure to follow proper safety precautions while hitching your tractor to wagons or other farming implements:


Make sure that the area in front and behind, making sure especially that no one is behind the tractor
Back the tractor up slowly
Practice a safe stop, applying the emergency brake

, Hold for approximately 8 seconds before letting go and trying again.

, If the tractor continues failure to start, it is recommended to spray starting fluid into the lines.

, Now that your tractor has started, depending on the year, it may have a steering wheel hand clutch, which will be located on the right of your steering wheel. This is usually found in John Deere 4020's. Locate your shifter, and most tractors follow the same procedure for taking off.


If it has a hand foot clutch, the shifter will be in between your legs, near the foot petals.
If your shifter is on your right hand side, and is located on the side of the throttle, it is most likely a power shifter.

, The tractor has labeled gears between first to the last one, including reverse. Push in the clutch, which is your left foot and push the shifter into first gear. Throttle the tractor up slowly to increase the RPMs. Slowly release your foot off the clutch and you will feel the tractor begin to move. throttle the RPMs again to increase speed, and power.

, Now that your tractor is moving, in order to shift gears, locate second, or the next gear you need. Press in the clutch and shift the gear. Slowly release the clutch and you will feel a small kick or since of power. The gear has locked and you are now in that desired gear.

",How to Maintain a Tractor," The manufacturer has specific instructions for basic care of your equipment, and they have the expertise to give you the best advice on how to do it. If you don't have a manual, get one. Here are some items you should find in the Owner's Manual:


Maintenance Schedule. This will tell you the intervals for routine maintenance, including chassis lubrication, engine, transmission, and hydraulic oil change, filter changes, and other maintenance items.
Specifications. This should be a table telling you the type of fluid for the transmission, hydraulic system, brakes, and engine coolant, as well as their capacities. Tire inflation, bolt torques, and other information may be found under specifications or other sections of the manual.
Location of lubricant points (grease fittings), fluid check dipsticks or sight glasses, and instructions on cleaning air and fuel filters.
Basic operating instructions and other information specific to your tractor.;
, Tractor maintenance requires numerous wrenches and other tools in larger sizes than for automobile maintenance, so plan to buy or borrow the tools you need.

, Because most smaller farm (or garden) tractors do not have a cabin to protect the seat, instrument panel, and metal components, it is a good idea to store it in a shed or garage. If you can't do this, keep rain out of the exhaust system, and cover the seat and instruments.

, Tractor usage is measured in hours, not miles, so the amount of use may be deceptive, and leaking components may cause failure of expensive parts. Refer to the owner's manual to determine how each fluid is checked.
• Check the engine oil.
• Check the transmission fluid.
• Check the coolant in the radiator.
• Check the hydraulic oil.
• Check the battery electrolyte.

, Because of the shape, low inflation is not always obvious. Rear tires normally have between 12 and 20 PSI inflation pressure, the front tires may have up to 32 PSI. The back tires on farm tractors should be filled with ballast, especially if you are pulling an implement where maximum traction is required. Usually this ballast is water with an antifreeze solution added.

, If your tractor is equipped with a hydraulic system, it has high pressure hoses and/or tubing, and failure of this fluid conduit can cause component (hydraulic pump) failure, loss of steering, or other problems. If a hose (or belt) appears damaged, worn, or cracked, replace it. If fittings or connections are leaking, tighten them or replace the seals.

, Many tractors have mechanical brakes, operated by a linkage and cam system instead of a master/slave fluid system. These brakes are located on the rear axles, and work independently, so that they may be used to steer the tractor in tight corners or to reverse the direction of travel. The brake pedals will interlock for road travel, so that one pedal is not accidentally engaged by itself, causing the tractor to spin while traveling at a high speed.

, Keep an eye on the temperature, oil pressure, and tachometer.


The temperature gauge should be marked with a normal operating range, but any time the indicator says the temperature is over 220 °F (104 °C), the engine is running hot.
If equipped with a diesel engine, the oil pressure should be between 40 and 60 PSI.
The tachometer tells how many revolutions per minute the crankshaft is turning. Diesel engines are designed to operate at lower RPM and higher torque than gasoline engines, and ""over revving"" your engine, or operating it at maximum RPMs is not recommended.


, Most systems on tractors are equipped with filters to protect against dirt, water, or other contaminants that could cause failure of the components.


Check the fuel filter for accumulated water. Most diesel engines have a water separating filter, since diesel fuel attracts moisture.
Check the air filter often. Tractors are often operated in very dusty conditions, and in some cases, the filters must be cleaned daily or weekly. Clean the air filter with a shop vacuum or with compressed air, never by washing it. Replace the air filter when it cannot be cleaned satisfactorily, or if the filter is damaged.


, Tractors are often operated in conditions where debris may accumulate on the radiator, so they usually have a front screen or grill to prevent plant matter, insects, or pollen from clogging the radiator.

, Tractors have many more moving parts that require greasing than do automobiles. If you see a part that moves, look for a grease fitting, and grease it. Use a grease cartridge pressure gun, clean the fitting, attach the hose, and pump grease until the associated seal begins to expand, or grease is seen oozing out of the attachment you are lubricating. Look for grease fittings on steering components, brake and clutch linkages, and three-point hitch pivot points.


Older tractors require specific lubricants in the gear boxes. Often, the hydraulic system and the transaxle share fluid, and using the wrong fluid can cause serious damage.


, If you are using your tractor for cultivation or mowing, it should have a recommended size attachment for the job you are doing. As an example, do not pull an eight foot mower with a 35 horsepower tractor.

Locate a parking spot.,
Check for traffic in both directions.,
Put on your turn signal.,
Turn into the spot slowly.,
Center your vehicle in the spot.,
Put the vehicle in park.",How to Angle Park1," As you enter the garage or lot, keep your eyes peeled for a vacant spot. Angled parking spots are most commonly used in high-traffic areas, so spots may come and go quickly. Look for telltale spaces between cars or other drivers who are preparing to leave.Make sure you’re paying attention while scanning for an opening to avoid an accident.
Angled parking spots take up less space than perpendicular ones. For this reason, they’re often seen in commercial lots, multilevel garages and busy side streets.;
, Look from left to right to make sure there are no cars coming. Be sure to also watch the drivers in front of you in case they slow down or make a sudden turn. When you’re certain that your path is clear, begin approaching the spot slowly.You should always be in the habit of checking for traffic, pedestrians and other potential obstacles, even when you’re just parking.If the parking spot is on a one-way street, you won’t have to worry about any cars other than the ones behind you.

, Using your turn signal will let oncoming vehicles know that you’re about to park and indicate which direction you’ll be turning. That way, they’ll be able to adjust their speed or come to a stop to give you the room you need to pull into the spot.








It’s important to use your turn signals correctly to let other drivers know your intentions. Activate your right turn signal if the parking spot is on your right; switch on your left turn signal if it’s on your left.
You can also use your signal to show that you’re waiting on a spot to open up in a crowded lot.

, Reduce your speed as you near the parking spot. Press the brake lightly and let your vehicle coast until it’s alongside the spot. When your mirrors are even with the line on the side nearest to you, begin turning the steering wheel to guide the front end of the vehicle into the spot.








The slower you’re traveling, the more room for error you’ll have when making the turn.If you’re going too fast as you get closer to the spot, you may accidentally overshoot it.

, Continue turning until the front end of your vehicle is in line with the edges of the parking spot. Inch forward and come to a stop at the line, curb or wall that marks the end of the spot. Ideally, your vehicle should be pulled up as far as it can go—this will make you less likely to get rear-ended.








Use your windows and mirrors to double check that you’re lined up correctly.
If you happen to pull in crooked, put your vehicle in reverse, back halfway out (checking behind you before you do) and straighten up.

, Once you’ve come to a complete stop, hold down the brake pedal and slide the gear shift to the “P” position. This will place your vehicle in park. Turn off the engine. You can now safely exit the vehicle.









Keep your foot on the brake until the vehicle is securely parked.
It may help to apply the parking brake if you’re parking on an incline. This will prevent the vehicle from rolling out of the spot."

You don't need a very powerful bike.,
Sit comfortably, upright on the bike.,
Drive at a steady pace around 1500-2000rpm.,
When you are ready for liftoff, quickly open up the throttle and accelerate.,
Almost immediately after accelerating, pull clutch in enough to disengage and let the engine rev to about 6000RPM.,
Quickly release the clutch at about 80%.,
Once you master this, your bike should be popping up a little bit.,
So once again.. once comfortable with the clutch release motion, start giving it lots of throttle.,
Once you get good, you won't have to rev before you clutch.,
Finished.








",How to Perform Clutch Wheelies on a Motorcycle," You can definitely clutch wheelie a 500 cc sport bike, it just takes higher revs.









Stock gearing is fine, however, with this setup it can't clutch up in 2nd. You'll need a 520 kit for that. (To clutch up in second with less bouncing, try going -1 on the front sprocket, and +2 on the rear.
If you buy these sprockets in 525 pitch, you will be able to change them and use the stock chain).
(Edit: The chain length will be correct, but you cannot use a 520 chain on 525 sprockets, or vice versa.);
, You don't have to slide back for this trick. ""It is possible to pull a wheelie at 70 mph (110 km/h) in 3rd gear on a gsxr-600."" This will take more practice, but it is very possible.








, (Should be about 10-20mph).








, This is VERY important because it compresses your rear suspension. It's very difficult to clutch a wheelie without compressing rear suspension first. You're not trying to build up speed! Starting at low RPMs is very important. If you start a clutch wheelie at 5000RPM, it will be very difficult and you'll red line long before you go vertical. Power comes from low RPM.








, You can do this slow at first, eventually it becomes an instantaneous motion.








, This is the hardest part. You HAVE to release fast. You'll know you released too fast when your RPM drops down to 2000 - this means you released too fast. Practice, practice, practice. When you get it right it will feel like you have hydraulics on your front wheel and pop right up (much quicker and smoother than a power-bounce wheelie).








, The next step is throttle control.









While releasing the clutch, add throttle. If you want to go big - vertical - and stay there - the big thing to learn is that you can not let go of the throttle OR the clutch. You will control height of the wheelie with your clutch at this point.

, You should be able to keep it up in 1st gear for a few seconds without any problems. The higher you go the longer you stay up.








, Do them at the same time.

Understand the reason for knee sliding.,
Use correct body position.,
Learn to carve the turns at slower speeds by inducing countersteering.

,
Practice throwing your knee out to the same position through the turns, even if it doesn't touch the ground yet, just get in the habit of throwing the knee out there to the same position every time.,
Get some pictures of you in action.,
Pay attention to, and learn about, the traction.,
Be consistent.,
Lastly, ask for tips and critique.",How to Drag a Knee on a Sportbike," The purpose of dragging a knee is to indicate to the pilot the angle of motorcycle lean. At high speed sport bikes don't turn through turns, they carve through turns by leaning over in the direction of the turn. This lean is is induced by counter-steering and is essentially a controlled fall over to either side. The gyroscopic nature of the rotating wheels and the traction of the tires allows the pilot to lean the motorcycle over through the turn and return it upright as the turn is completed.;
, On the balls of your feet, torso bent over the tank, head tucked down and hands on the grips with a relaxed grip.

,, This ""same position"" every time is important because touching down the knee is an indicator of lean angle, if your positioning isn't consistent you'll have no way to judge lean angle consistently.

, If a photographer is available and you can see some pictures of how you look you'll know how close you are to touching down. You might also pick up errors in body positioning that are contrary to safe efficient operation.

, You're also learning about traction as you go through these exercises. Watch faster riders, study their body position, how they get their weight low to the inside of the turn. Knee out, torso shifted to the inside, head out from behind the screen near the edge of the front fairing.


By now you might be suspecting the bike has more traction available than you're using, and if it hasn't slipped or crashed you'd be right. Continue becoming more comfortable with lean angle and body positioning. The whole idea here is to carve the turn with the minimum amount of motorcycle lean as necessary by getting your body weight positioned correctly.

, Dragging a knee is an indicator of lean angle so consistency is key. The more comfortable you become leaning the motorcycle over the sooner you'll feel that first scrape on the sliders. Focus on not hanging off the motorcycle to an extreme as well as not leaning the bike over so far that traction is easily compromised.

, If Control Riders or Instructors are available ask them to follow you a few laps and give feedback, they're there to help you achieve your goals.

,
Repeat step 3, increasing the amount of throttle every time.








,
After feeling comfortable with quick acceleration in a straight line, you should learn the chop the throttle technique:









Quickly roll on the throttle till you feel the weight transfer to the back wheel.,
Once the front wheel is off the ground, slowly decrease throttle to bring the front wheel back on the ground.








,
Practice this technique until you feel comfortable and safe to wheelie your bike.

Assemble the items needed.,
Slacken the centre nut first by backing it off by a few turns but leaving it in place.,
Insert the ratchet as shown in the image.,
Remove the wheel.",How to Remove a Steering Wheel from a Tractor," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". Park the tractor somewhere safe and ensure that it is completely turned off and it is sitting where it cannot move.;
, This will prevent the steering wheel jumping from the shaft if it releases suddenly. Place the puller on the steering wheel. To avoid damaging the centering tip of the puller, place a few washers under the screw. This gives it a firm, well-balanced grip. Once the steering wheel has moved, the retaining centre nut should be removed.

, Apply just the minimum amount of force to the ratchet while the puller is firmly seated. You will note that this begins to break the steering wheel free.

, The steering wheel comes off with no damage. Perform any maintenance tasks required and either restore the wheel or replace it.

Put the car in reverse.,
Check behind you for cross traffic.,
Begin backing out slowly.,
Turn the wheel slightly as you exit the spot.,
Line your vehicle up with the main drive.,
Drive away.",How to Angle Park2," Start the engine and press your foot down on the brake pedal. Move the gear shift to the “R” position. You’ll now be ready to back out of the spot.








Don’t forget to disengage the parking brake if you put it on while parking.

, Before you begin backing out, turn your head to scan for oncoming vehicles. They might be harder to see when exiting the spot, so look twice just to be on the safe side. Don’t start backing out until you’re sure no one is approaching.








Look over the same shoulder as the direction you’ll be turning.The white reversing lights on the back of your vehicle will alert other drivers that you’re preparing to pull out of the parking spot.

, Pull straight out of the spot, using the brake to control your speed. Keep your foot on the brake the whole time you’re easing out. Check again for oncoming traffic once your line of sight is clear. 








Never back out of a parking spot with your foot on the accelerator.
Vehicles in the travel lane technically have the right of way, so be sure to stop if you see another car coming., When you’re halfway out of the spot, start cutting the wheel gradually in the same direction you pulled in. Since the spot is at an angle, you won’t need to turn much. Just make a smooth, loose arc, reversing until you’re pointed straight ahead.








The key to steering in reverse is to turn the wheel whichever way you want the rear of the vehicle to go.
Angled spots are meant to be exited the same way they’re entered. Cutting the wrong way will force you to make a much sharper turn and may leave you facing the wrong direction.

, Come to a complete stop, then shift the vehicle into drive (the “D” position on the gear shift). Rotate the steering wheel to straighten out your front tires. Wait until the lane ahead of you is clear to begin moving forward.









Make sure you have adequate clearance on all sides before you proceed to drive off.Keep an eye out for other drivers attempting to leave their parking spots.

, Once you're safely out of the parking spot, increase your speed and return to the flow of traffic. Congratulations, you’ve successfully angle parked!









Watch your speed until you’re out of the parking lot or garage.

Judge the turn while it’s in the distance.,
Reduce your speed as the turn approaches.,
Check traffic conditions while approaching the turn.,
Shift your weight and lean into the turn.,
Keep your eyes focused on the oncoming roadway.,
Increase the throttle at the halfway point or last third of the turn.,
Realize that maximum speed in the turn isn’t your goal.,
Identify when you are going too fast and make corrections.,
Stay calm in surprising turns and make adjustments.",How to Turn Safely on a Motorcycle," The more information you know about the turn in advance, the safer you’ll be able to navigate this feature in the road. Sharper turns will often have a vanishing point where you cannot see any further in the turn. Note this point and be prepared for anything while approaching it. You’ll also have to gauge the angle of the turn so that when you reach it, you’re ready to match the angle in an easy, fluid turn.


Some turns will get tighter or loosen up at surprising points, especially at the end of the turn. It can be difficult to predict the end of a turn due to the fact that most will be blocked from site by vegetation, the vanishing point, or other features, like traffic. You may have to make minor corrections at the end of your turn to account for this.
Scope out as much of the turn as possible while approaching it. Keep your eyes on the oncoming road, and if possible, peer through foliage and obstacles to give yourself a better idea of what’s on the other side of the turn. However, don’t get too carried away. Straining to see through foliage can distract you from what is right before your eyes.
Use roadside features to help gauge the angle of the turn. By looking at the angle formed by lamp posts, guard rails, safety walls, roadside signs, and so on, you can more accurately predict more of the angle than you can see. If you notice the roadside features beginning to cut a sharper angle toward the inside, the turn will also likely cut in this way.;
, Release the throttle to slow your speed and gently apply the brake, if necessary. You’ll want to be at the recommended speed for the turn, or as slow as you feel comfortable, before entering the turn. If it arrives more quickly than you expected, you may need to apply both the front and rear brakes simultaneously in order to slow down enough for the turn.


If you are a beginner learning this process, you will need to reduce your speed much more than experienced riders. Practice on low traffic roads. Be sure you downshift if your speed slows to the point where downshifting is necessary. The right gear for taking your turn will be one that easily allows you to coast through the turn and accelerate out of it.
To gain a better sense of which gear you should use for a particular turn, you should choose a stretch of low traffic road with turns that you know well. When the road is clear, approach the turn and slow your bike to shift into a lower gear than you typically use. Then repeat this exercise one gear higher than you would normally. While you’re in higher gears it will likely be more difficult to accelerate out of the turn., Your motorcycle is much smaller than most other traffic on the road, making it easier to miss than other cars. You’ll want to be sure the space around you, including your blind spot, is free of traffic that could be a hazard to you while turning. Note any cars that are driving erratically or accelerating dangerously; you may want to let these cars pass you or allow some cushion distance between you and potentially dangerous vehicles.


Don’t make the mistake of relying solely on your mirrors. Your side view mirrors will likely be at least partially blocked by your elbows and/or sounders. This means that your mirrors won’t give you the complete surrounding view you’ll need to make your turn safely.
Exercise caution when doing your head check of your blind spot. If you turn your head too far to look over your shoulder at traffic behind you, you might end up turning your handlebars as well. This can dangerously throw off your balance while approaching the turn., Many motorcyclists call this maneuver “counter steering,” though this name is somewhat inaccurate as you won’t be turning the handlebars of your bike much at all. As you go into the turn, push on the bike with half of your body on the outside of the turn. For example, in a right turn, you would push on your motorcycle with your left buttock and leg, which will cause your bike to lean into the turn. It may also help you to apply pressure to the inside handlebar in a downward fashion. You won’t actually be using your handlebars to steer, only to help distribute your weight as you lean into the turn.


The motion should feel like a downward pushing motion while the momentum of your bike causes your weight to shift deeply into the turn. When you are coming out of the turn, be careful not to sit up straight immediately. This can result in imbalance and a loss of control in your bike.
Avoid clinging to the handlebars too tightly. It can be uncomfortable for new riders to lean as deeply into a turn as might be necessary. The fear response this causes could leave you hanging onto the handlebars desperately. However, this will make the pushing force down on the inside handlebar more difficult. Your lower body should be sufficient to keep you attached to the bike., Your eyes should remain level and be focused on the farthest visible point in the turn. This way, if any unforeseen conditions arise, you have as much warning as possible. However, don't be so focused that you lose awareness of objects in your peripheral vision. In sharp curves especially, where your bike will naturally lean more deeply into the turn, cars may have difficulty seeing your bike. In this case, your peripheral vision can save your life.


Your vision will be limited by the pitch of your bike, the sharpness of the turn, and other roadside features, like trees and tall grass. This means your line of sight will be more reduced than normal while in the turn, creating a vital need for you to pay attention to the oncoming road., This will help your motorcycle upright itself while emerging from the turn. Allow your weight to become normally distributed again as you pull out of the corner and release downward pressure on your inside handlebar, if you have been applying pressure there. Now that you’re through the turn, you may proceed along the road as would normally.


Avoid throwing your weight one way or another while the forces acting on your bike cause it to become upright again. This can throw off the stability of your bike and cause an unnecessary accident., It can be exhilarating to pull through a turn at top speed and sail through the end of it like a bullet, but this can be very dangerous for riders and other traffic alike. The goal of any turn when you are driving in normal traffic should never be a specific speed, but should instead be a clean, controlled, and safe turn with minimal to no corrections in speed or angle.


As you become more and more experienced riding your motorcycle, you’ll find yourself more comfortable with taking turns. This will naturally result in higher speeds in the turn, but with your improved skills, these turns should be just as safe as those made at slower speeds. Keep your eyes aware of oncoming road conditions and your angle of turn an uninterrupted arc., When entering your turn, if you feel an irresistible impulse to brake, close/turn down the throttle, or drive past the corner to avoid it, you are probably going faster than you should be. When you feel safe and comfortable on your bike, you have attained the right speed for the corner. The speed at which you should take a turn will depend on your bike, your stature, road conditions, and other factors, meaning that the “right speed” can vary considerably from person to person.


Maintain a constant throttle. Letting off your throttle is not advised while in the turn, though if you do this, it is a fairly strong indicator that you have taken your turn at too high a speed. Instead you should apply the rear brake lightly. This will cause your bike to steer into the corner more deeply without straightening.
In an emergency situation where an unforeseen obstacle, like a child or tree branch, is in the road and you need to brake hard, you should pull your clutch and apply your front brake. You will need to continue pushing your bike into the corner to prevent you from losing control. For most people, this will involve pushing with the knee on the outside of your turn and your buttock of the same side., Some turns will be so sharp, or the natural features so thick and difficult to see around, that you won’t know what is coming next until you’re already in the turn. This may mean that you get a nasty surprise in the form of an obstacle or angle change later in your turn. When this happens, you’ll need to make slight corrections by steering out of the corner (in the opposite direction of the turn), and then adjust again soon after that to return your bike to lean into the turn. For large or irregular turns, you may need to make several of these corrections.


When riding your bike into a corner, always be thinking ahead. In the worst case scenario, you should know how you’ll respond. In some cases, this might mean steering your bike onto the shoulder or a safe patch alongside the road to miss a pedestrian. Even with turns you know well, you should be prepared to make adjustments to your turning just in case something unexpected happens.
In the event your bike cuts too far along the inside or outside of the road, don’t panic. Cutting a corner to near or far can put you in dangerous proximity to oncoming traffic or obstacles, like a guardrail or safety wall. Analyze the angle of your turn and keep your eyes focused well ahead of you on the approaching road. This way, you’ll be ready to make corrections the instant you notice a need for one."
"
Examine the turn.,
Initiate your turn signal.,
Check your position.,
Check for on-coming traffic and yield, if necessary.,
Slow your speed and downshift.,
Countersteer gently to make the turn.,
Keep your head up.,
Accelerate out of the corner.",How to Turn Right on a Motorcycle," As you're approaching your turn, make sure there are no traffic signals, road bumps, pedestrians, parked cars, or other obstacles that will keep you from turning accurately and safely. Look ahead of you to learn anything you'll need to know to make the turn.


Be aware of the grade of the turn, to get some idea of how much you'll need to slow down, and what gear you'll need to shift into.
Examine closely the quality and texture of the road. Is it wet? Is there any gravel or other conditions that might result in a skid?;
, About 100 feet (30.48 meters) before your turn, initiate your turn signal to the right, to make other drivers aware of your intention to turn. If you don't have a functional turn signal, signal with your hand.


In the US and most European countries, cyclists signal a right turn by pointing right with the right hand.
In vehicles, however, it's common to signal a right turn by lifting the left arm at a right angle. Both of these are acceptable signals for a right turn.

, First, check your mirrors for traffic behind you. Then check over your right shoulder to double-check your blind spots, and, if safe, move towards the center of the lane as much as possible, to make your turn more efficient. Keep a close watch for traffic behind you and traffic in the adjacent lane and move into position for the turn.


The gentler your turn, the higher the speed at which you may turn.






The sharper the turn, the more you'll need to slow down.







, Make sure you look to the left for traffic coming through the intersection and straight ahead for traffic turning left.


In the United States, turning right on a motorcycle means you need to look for drivers turning left in front of you, pedestrians who may be crossing the street onto which you're turning, and possible bicycle traffic to your right.
In the UK and elsewhere in the world, turning right on a motorcycle means you need to yield to oncoming traffic and wait for an opening or an appropriate turning signal before negotiating the turn. You'll sometimes have to come to a full stop in the turning lane.

, Depress the clutch and brake if necessary to slow the motorcycle to the appropriate speed for making the turn. Shift into a lower gear before you make the turn, to keep the bike at a consistent speed. Gently release or ""feather"" the clutch as you steadily increase the throttle. This assures that you don't put too much power to the tires and cause them to slide out.


Generally, for city driving conditions, second or third gear is appropriate for negotiating a turn at a moderate speed, though some bikes with V-twin engines, like Harley-Davidsons, will be more comfortable to turn at first gear. The higher low-end torque of these engines make back-wheel skid more likely.






All your speed adjustments and braking should be done prior to the turning motion, not during. Each turn will require a different degree of speed to make the turn safely, so much of this will have to do with your judgment and your feel of the bike and of the turn.







, Initiate the turn by gently loosening your grip on the left handle of the handlebars, and pressing on the right side of the handlebar, tilting it gently left, and leaning into the turn.


Turning is mostly about leaning gently, not about turning the handlebars. You neither need to lean nor turn very much to negotiate the turn properly.






Make sure, if you have a passenger, that the passenger knows to lean into the turn, not out of it.

, It's very important to look up, at where you want the motorcycle to go, not down at the front wheel, or directly in front of you. If you look straight at the object you wish to avoid you will likely hit it.


Never put your leg down to assist a turn. It's very easy to lose control of the bike and injure yourself this way.







, Gradually apply power as you come out of the turn. This serves to settle the suspension of the bike and stabilize it.


It is a bad idea to brake or shift down in the middle of a corner, unless it is an emergency.

Turn the key.,
Flip the kill switch to the on position.,
Squeeze the brake levers.,
Press the start button.",How to Start a Moped1," Put the key in the ignition. Turn it to the right until it clicks in place, signifying that the ignition has been engaged.;
, Since mopeds generate automatic movement, they have a kill switch to shut them down quickly. The kill switch is a colored switch near the handlebars. Find it and flip it to the on position, which is often represented as an open circle., The brake levers are on the moped’s handlebars. The back brake is necessary to engage and is activated by the left lever. However, it’s easier to hold both until you are ready to drive.The moped will move automatically when you start it, so if you don’t have the back brake engaged, you’ll pitch forward.

, Continue holding the levers. Use your thumb to hit the start button. This will often be a red button near the right handlebar. Once you hear the motor start, you are free to release the brakes and drive.

Put the key in the lock.,
Turn the key.,
Turn on the fuel valve.,
Flip the engine switch.,
Depress the choke.,
Pull the starting lever.,
Push the pedal.",How to Start a Moped2," Vintage brands such as Puch have more complicated starting processes. First, if the lock has been engaged, start unlocking the moped using the keylock right below the handlebars. Move the handlebar to the right. Put the key inside the lock.


Be aware that different brands may require more or less steps to start.

, First turn the key to the right. When it is turned to the right, you should be able to push it in. Once you do that, turn the key back to the left until the moped is unlocked., On a Puch Maxi, for example, you’ll find the fuel valve on the right side of the moped’s frame. This is a switch you must turn off when you park the moped. You may see the “on” and “off” labels on your moped. Pull the lever into the “on” position.

, Look near the handlebars for the engine switch. On the Puch Maxi, it’s on the right side. Make sure the switch is flipped to the “run” position.

, This only needs to be done if the engine is cold from disuse. Locate the carburetor. It’ll have a small black bar poking out of it. This is the choke, which you need to press and hold. While you do this, look downwards and find the small primer button on the carburetor. Press this too., Hold the front brake, which is on the right side of the handlebars, so you keep the moped under control. Find the starting lever under the left handlebar. Keep the pedals level as you pull it., Continue holding the starting lever as you begin to pedal. The engine should start and you should be free to go. If it doesn’t start, you may need to try pedal starting it.

"
"
Place the key in the ignition.,
Pedal forward.,
Press the start button.,
Open the throttle.,
Release the start lever.",How to Start a Moped3," Pedal starting is useful for starting a struggling engine and moving from a stop. Get the key in place. Turn it to the right until it clicks to show that the ignition has been engaged. Do this before you start pedaling so you don’t have to fumble with the key.

, Work the pedals like you would a bicycle. Release the kickstand and push forward to get a little momentum. Pedaling will be a little difficult because of the weight of the moped, but keep going until the starting process is complete., Find the start button on your moped. It may be a red button near the right handlebar or a lever on the left handlebar. Some vehicles may also have a kickstart lever on one of the wheels that you can hit with your foot instead. Use this to start the motor.


Since you’re already moving, don’t hit the brakes.

, Locate the throttle. It is likely on the right handlebar. Lay your palm flat on the throttle, then gently turn it towards you. This opens the throttle as you move, allowing more air to enter the engine. Continue to twist the throttle to accelerate., With the motor started, the moped should be moving without you having to pedal. Adjust your body as the force of movement pulls you back. Stay straight with your eyes on the road as you let go of the starting lever or button if you haven’t yet.

"
"
Remove the spark plug.,
Check the gas.,
Try the choke.",How to Start a Moped4," To check the ignition spark, find the plug on the engine. Make sure the kill switch near the moped’s handlebars is off before you do this. Try to start the moped. If the engine works, you should see a spark inside of it. Your finger would pop off if you held it over the hole.If the spark plug looks dirty, try a new one.
If the engine won’t start at all, you may need a new battery.

, Open the fuel tank. If the gas has been sitting in there for at least a month, water will gather at the bottom of the tank. Unscrew the drain screw on the carburetor or undo the hose so that the water comes out. Catch any gas in a container.Use compressed air to blow debris out of the carburetor.

, If you’re sure there’s a spark, gas infusion, and air moving through the moped, try pressing the choke. It’s the small black rod sticking out of the carburetor. Press it and try to start the engine. If it sounds like it is trying to start, open the throttle, which may be operated by turning the right handlebar towards you. Try starting the engine a few times while doing this."
"
Determine whether you have a carburetor-based or fuel-injected motorcycle.,
Sit on your motorcycle seat when starting it.,
Make sure that the motorcycle is in working condition.,
Check the oil level.,
Check the battery.",How to Start a Motorcycle1," Many motorcycles, especially older or less expensive models, do not have modern fuel injection systems. If you aren't sure, you can tell by looking for a choke control. It is normally located on the left handlebar, above the horn. Carbureted motorcycles have a choke, but fuel-injected bikes do not., This will put you in full control of anything that happens once it's started. If you are starting the motorcycle unmounted for some reason, make sure that you shift your bike into neutral (located between 1st and 2nd gear) before you fire the engine. You don't want the bike to take off without you!








, You should have plenty of gas and a well-charged battery. It is important to keep the motorcycle properly serviced, particularly in damp or cold conditions. Fit new spark plugs, or, if not worn, clean and gap the old ones. Check the ignition timing, and adjust if necessary; if fitted, have the ignition points replaced. A carburetor service and clean is also a great idea.



Replace the spark plug leads if they look old, worn, or frayed. Use only manufacturer-recommended spark plugs and plug leads – look for the reference in your motorcycle's handbook.

, Before starting any engine, make sure it is lubricated by checking the oil level. If there is no oil, or the oil level is too low, do not start the engine. Otherwise it will heat up, then will break down.








, Put in the key and turn the key clockwise until the lights turn on. If the lights does not turn on, that usually means the battery is dead and you need to recharge it or install a new one.

Look for the ""choke"" lever or cut-off switch.,
Open the choke lever.,
Turn your ignition to the ""on"" position.,
Start the engine.,
Close the choke and open the throttle.",How to Start a Motorcycle2," For cold starting, there is usually a choke lever or ""cut-off switch"" on the handlebar. On some bikes, there may be a choke lever mounted on the carburetor. Operating this will provide the necessary rich fuel mixture when the motorcycle is ""cold"" – when it hasn't been used for more than a few hours. The dirtier the carburetor, or the colder the engine is, the more the choke will need to be engaged.You don't need to use the choke lever when starting a motorcycle ""hot."" If the motorcycle has been running and the engine is already hot, you won't need as much power to get it going. Just use a small amount of throttle and the engine should fire.Many bikes have a cut-off switch on the kickstand, so make sure that the kickstand is up as well. Having the bike in neutral will disable the kickstand shutoff.

, Make sure that the cut-off switch is ""on."" You will need to leave the handlebar throttle twist-grip closed while operating the starter motor or kick-start lever. Otherwise, the engine will flood, making starting difficult or impossible. Remember – the choke lever is usually not necessary if the bike has already been running in the past few hours.







, Your dash lights should ""light up"" when it's in this position. Also if your bike is in neutral as suggested, then you should notice a green light indicating that you are in neutral.








, Squeeze and hold your clutch lever down (located on the left) and push the start button (located on the right). You should hear the blissful sound of your motorcycle cranking up.








, Shortly after the engine fires, close the choke lever progressively and open the throttle slightly as the engine warms. As you ride, you may still need some choke for a short distance – but close the choke lever as soon as possible to achieve smooth running. Do not over-rev the motorcycle when it is warming up.








"
"
Put the motorcycle into neutral.,
Don't worry about the choke lever.,
Pull the clutch in toward the handlebar.,
Press and hold in the start button.,
Try using the throttle.",How to Start a Motorcycle3," You can almost always find this between first and second gear.







, For electronically fuel-injected motorcycles, the engine management system will automatically look after fueling needs whether the engine is hot or cold. There is no choke lever on these motorcycles. Use a small amount of throttle when starting either hot or cold.

, It's usually on the the left-hand side. Many riders choose to also pull in the front brake (on the right handlebar) at the same time.








, This is usually located on the right handlebar, near the bottom of where the hand will naturally rest.








, If the motorcycle does not catch and start, try using the throttle while pressing the start button. Make sure to keep the clutch held all of the way in while doing this.

Become familiar the clutch, throttle, and gear shifter.,
Start the motorcycle by squeezing the clutch, then pressing the starter button.,
Shift into first gear.,
Upshift into higher gears.,
Downshift to a lower gear.",How to Shift Gears on a Motorcycle1," The clutch is located in front of the left handgrip. It is responsible for transferring torque from the engine to the transmission. The throttle located on the right hand grip. Rolling on the throttle increases the engine RPM to prevent the engine from stalling. The gear shift is a bar located in front of the left foot pedal. It is responsible for switching between gears. Practice the following:


Squeeze the clutch lever in, then slowly ease it out.
Roll the throttle towards the back of the motorcycle (""roll on"") to go faster.
Roll the throttle towards the front of the motorcycle (""roll off"") to go slower.
Press down on the gear shift to put the motorcycle into first gear. This only works if you are in neutral or second gear, otherwise, pressing down the gear shift will only take you to a lower gear.
Move the gear shift upwards to reach the remaining gears. The predominant gear pattern for manual motorcycles is one down, and four or five up. Neutral is found between first and second gear.;
, Make sure that you are resting in the neutral position. Neutral is indicated by a green ""N"" light on the meter console; all new bikes comes with this feature. At this point, you should be sitting on the saddle of the bike.







, Start by closing the throttle, and then pull the clutch in all the way. At the same time, move the gear shift into first gear by pushing downwards on the shifter. Then, slowly apply throttle while releasing the clutch gently until the motorcycle starts to roll slowly. After this point start increasing throttle input and release the clutch all the way.









Do not be in a hurry to release the clutch lever, continue to coordinate the throttle and the clutch until the motorcycle is moving. As the motorcycle increases speed, continue to ease the clutch lever out smoothly and slowly.

, When you have achieved sufficient speed to justify shifting to a higher gear, roll off, (close) the throttle as you squeeze in the clutch. Place the toes of your left foot under the shift peg, lift the peg up as far as it will go. You can continue moving into higher gears by bumping the gear shift upwards more. One bump goes to second, another to third, another to fourth, and so on. NOTE: an experienced rider does not need to operate the clutch to shift up. He simply lifts the shifter lightly with his foot, and then, when he down-blips the throttle, the next higher gear will engage. Doing this smoothly takes a bit of practice, yet saves shifting time, and also slightly increases the lifetime of the clutch plates.









If you are in first gear and you lift half way, you will find neutral.
If you release the clutch and roll on the throttle and nothing happens, you're in neutral, squeeze the clutch and lift again.
If you skip a gear by accident, don’t worry. It won’t damage the bike as long as you make sure to match the throttle to the gear you have shifted to., Roll off (""close"") the throttle as you squeeze in the clutch. Press down on the gear shift peg, then release it. Smoothly adjust the clutch and throttle together to match the speed that you are currently traveling. If you are coming to a stop, keep the throttle closed, hold in the clutch and continue to press and release the shifter until you are in first gear.

Learn the required controls.,
Turn the bike on.,
Shift into first gear.,
Shift into higher gears.,
Downshift into lower gears.",How to Shift Gears on a Motorcycle2," All that you need to do to shift gears on a motorcycle with a semi-automatic transmission is throttle the engine and use the gear shift. On a semi-automatic, the clutch is tied in to the gear shift, so using the gear shift activates both controls at once.

, Straddle the bike and make sure it is in neutral before proceeding to shift gears.








, This is a very basic process, as all you have to do is throttle the engine and press down one click on the gear shift. First gear is always found by moving the gear shift down a notch, while the remaining gears can be reached by moving the gear shift upwards.








, To do this, use the same process of shifting into first gear. Throttle the engine and push the gear shift upwards with your toe. Pushing it one click with move it to 2nd gear, giving it another gear will move it to 3rd, and so on.








, To slow down and eventually come to a stop, you can downshift into lower gears by pushing down on the gear shift. Always put your bike in neutral when you are stopped.

In a nutshell, you need to find witnesses for your start and end points, and keep a fuel log with all receipts.;
, Choose roads that allow for higher speeds, such as interstates or major highways. Try to avoid going through too many stop signs or traffic lights, because they will slow you down. You can plan a loop route that begins and ends at the same place, or a one-way route. Know your bike's touring range (how many miles between fill ups) and make sure you'll be able to buy gas when you need it. Many riders use trip planning software such as MS Streets and Trips, because it calculates distances and has gas station information. However this is not necessary, and it can certainly be done old-school with paper maps. Account for time of day: Avoid big cities during rush hour, avoid deer-infested forests at night.

, Your tires should have enough tread to complete the ride, and be properly inflated. Your riding position should be comfortable for long periods. A relatively upright position is best, though people have done this ride on racer-type bikes or ape-hanger'd cruisers. You should have a way to rest your throttle hand, either a cruise control, throttle lock, or wrist rest. Verify that your lights work, because you'll need them.

, Besides the standard safety gear like helmet and boots, you'll need to be prepared for varying weather. This means layered clothes and a rain suit. It will be very helpful to have earplugs, because all that wind noise can be very fatiguing over a long period.

Wear your protective gear.,
Practice while riding uphill.,
Maintain a comfortable speed on flat ground.,
Pull your front wheel into the air.,
Maintain your motion in the wheelie.",How to Do a Basic Wheelie on a Motorcycle1," You won't need the same level of protection when practicing on a bike, but it's always good to practice safely. Make sure you're wearing a helmet, at the bare minimum, and knee and elbow pads if you want to be really careful. While starting wheelies on a bike may seem totally harmless, you can still take some bad spills and hurt yourself., Start at an easy gear. Two or three is probably best, so there won't be too much excessive pedaling. The hill shouldn't be too steep, but learning on a nice, gradual slope can help you maintain your balance and keep your front wheel in the air.When you're learning to wheelie, your pedaling may become spastic, causing you to fall off the bike. The resistance of pedaling uphill will counteract those forces. That way, when you practice on flat ground, you'll maintain a straighter trajectory of motion.


It's not necessary, but it is easier to practice on a mountain bike, rather than a BMX bike. Their back wheels are much more stable, and the front of the bike will come up more easier. The large wheel base will also make you feel more powerful.

, This speed will vary on a case-by-case basis, but you can aim for somewhere between 5-10 MPH.Moving too quickly might cause you to lose control when you're only on one wheel. If you go to slow, however, you may not have the momentum to properly lift the front into the air.

, This will require some brute force from your upper body, as well as some powerful pedaling. Crouch over your front handlebars to prepare to pull up, and don't forget to look forward. Once you have the handlebars in the air, lean your weight back and continue pedaling. You may lose balance or not keep it up for long, but eventually, you'll feel yourself sinking into the wheelie for a longer period of time.

, Once you've gotten the front wheel in the air a few times successfully, you'll want to start riding the wheelie for longer. When you're in the air, soften your grip and extend your arms. You also want to use your rear brake to adjust your leverage while in your wheelie. Some people keep the rear brake held for the duration of the wheelie, while others simply tighten their grip on it when they feel the front wheel coming too high into the air. The harder you push on the brake, the harder you'll have to pedal to keep your front tire in the air.

"
"
Wear protective clothing.,
Find a secluded street or road.,
Learn on a bike with enough power.,
Check your rear tire for any damage.You'll be spending a significant amount of time on this back tire when you're practicing wheelies, so make sure that your tire is in good shape.,
Remove a tip-over sensor if your bike has one.",How to Do a Basic Wheelie on a Motorcycle2," You never want to get onto a motorcycle without the proper gear. This includes a thick motorcycle helmet, leather gloves, jeans or leather pants, and a strong leather jacket. You also want some strong boots, preferable leather, with some proper grip. When you're first getting started, it's also not a bad idea to wear elbow, ankle or knee guards, as you'll be going down a lot., Remember that learning this will take you quite some time, and you'll probably take a couple bad spills. You don't want to harm any pedestrians around you or crash your bike into any cars, either mobile or parked. Your constant attempts are also going to make a lot of noise, so you don't want to disrupt those around you.


It's illegal to wheelie on a street bike, so finding a secluded place to practice will also help you evade any trouble from law enforcement.

, If you're attempting to learn the power wheelie on a sport bike, you'll probably want a 500 cc motorcycle, at the minimum. You'll be lifting the front wheel solely with your acceleration, so you want to make sure that your bike has the power to pull that off.


You can also learn the power wheelie on a dirtbike. If you have access to one or want something a little more comfortable, this could be a smart idea. A 100 or 150 cc bike should have enough power to practice this stunt.

, You don't want any wobbling on that end. It's also ideal to run your tire pressure a little bit lower than you might normally, as it will make the wheelie more stable.

, This sensor might cause your bike to shut off if you tip too far backward. You will be tipping backward, and because you're just learning, may tip even further back than totally comfortable. Make sure your bike doesn't give out on you mid-wheelie by removing this sensor.


Your back exhaust may also hit the ground, depending on where it's located on your bike, so make sure that it won't tap the ground while you're on one wheel. If it does, you may grind the road and fall off of the bike.

Put yourself into first gear.,
Bring your bike to a good speed.,
Let off the gas while still maintaining your speed.,
Crank the gas to accelerate and bring the front wheel up.,
Maintain your balance in the wheelie.,
Reduce your throttle when you settle into a comfortable balance.,
Step on the rear brake to guide yourself down.",How to Do a Basic Wheelie on a Motorcycle3," You can practice in any gear that you'd like, but first is generally the easiest for beginners. If you ever graduate to learning clutch wheelies, you'll have to know how to shift gears within the wheelie. Because power wheelies are simply about using your acceleration to pull the bike's front upward, you won't have to worry about shifting.


Your back brake, much like the handbrake on a bicycle, will help you if you ever begin to tip too far backward. While riders often don't use the rear brake regularly, it's very helpful in your first steps of learning the wheelie.If you feel yourself moving dangerously far back, you can put some power on the rear brake, stopping your back wheel. This will quickly bring your front wheel down. Be careful when it's coming down, however, as you'll get some pressure in your direction upon impact.

, It's recommended that you start learning wheelies at a speed somewhere between 10-20 KPH. If you're moving too quickly, you may lose some control, causing you to crank the gas in an unsafe way. When practicing too slowly, however, you won't be able to pull the front wheel up with enough force.

, You don't want to slow down too much, but it's useful to lower your speed right before you accelerate into your wheelie. This will give you more of a kick when you hit the gas, and this extra power will bring your front wheel up more smoothly.

, Once you've dropped your speed a little, hit the throttle hard. As you're doing this, you'll pull the front of your bike up, like you're doing a wheelie on a bicycle.At first, these elevations will feel very slight, almost like bunny hops. As you become more comfortable lifting the front up, however, they will gradually become longer and longer.


When you lift the bike off the ground and come back down too suddenly, your front tire is going to shake on impact. If you don't land straight, you'll flip off the bike over the front, otherwise known as a highside. This may happen when you're first getting started, so just make sure that you're bringing your wheelies as straight down as possible to avoid it.

, When finding your balance point, lean back on the rear side of the bike, making sure that the center of gravity of your system (you and the bike) sits in the center. This will help you ride the wheelie for a longer period of time. Any tipping forward or backward will mess with the center of your system, causing you to tip.


When getting started, beginners might try to hug the tank with their knees, helping them hold on when the front wheel of the bike sticks up. This will actually prevent you from sliding backward against the seat. If you're stuck hugging the tank while your bike is going backward, then the gravity of the system won't be in balance.

, When you feel yourself easing into the balance of your wheelie, you can reduce the throttle, just slightly, so you don't lose control when holding its motion. Reducing it too much, however, will cause your bike to lose all its momentum.

, When you want to come out of your wheelie, you'll use the rear brake to bring the front end of the bike back onto the street. If you crank this too harshly, however, the front end is likely to crash down too quickly, and you may wobble or fall. To remedy this, you can increase the throttle as the front is coming down, balancing out your movement.

When riding with other motorcycles, avoid lane sharing.",How to Ride a Motorcycle Defensively and Prevent Accidents," Make sure that you have enough gas to reach your destination. Avoid switching to reserve in the busiest of city traffic. Ensure that your tires are properly inflated and your brakes, engine chain/belt, suspension, lights and oil/fluids are checked.;
, Goggles or glasses, boots, gloves, jeans or leather pants, and leather or at least denim jacket will protect your bare skin from coming into direct contact with the pavement in the event of a crash. While helmet laws have their proponents and critics, legalities aside, helmets have certainly saved lives in many circumstances. Clothes with protection for knees, elbows and shoulders are important, as they decrease chances of broken bones and tendons in these points. The first body parts to hit the ground are usually the worst cases in light to mild crashes. If you hit a corner, the chance for this kind of injury is high, with recovery slow and difficult. ""The use of heavy boots, jacket, gloves, etc., is effective in preventing or reducing abrasions and lacerations, which are frequent but rarely severe injuries"" .

, An aggressive motorcyclist leads others or rides alone riding on the left side of the lane, apparently to show dominance. A rider cannot possibly dominate cars or trucks. Avoid overtake to the right - circumstances will arise where vehicles try to merge from the right, thinking it is an open lane and hit riders because it seems to be empty at a glance (in many cases they don't see the bikes). An assertive rider will follow newer riders to observe their performance and not drag newer riders through curves faster than they can handle. An assertive rider uses lane choice (left, center or right thirds of a lane) to increase their visibility in traffic, depending on the situation. An aggressive motorcyclist disregards lanes or lane choice altogether and has the highest accident and fatality rates.

, Lights on daytime and horn beeping in any sign of danger is very important to help others see you, as the angle of view in cars and bigger vehicles is not good for smaller targets like motorcycles and bikes. If the other vehicle is not in the same direction (as entering the road from an angle or doing a turn or curve), it's view to a motorcycle is zero instantly. When selecting a motorcycle, in general larger motorcycles in bright colors or with a lot of chrome tend to be more visible. Louder motorcycles tend to catch motorist's attention (however motorcycles that are too loud can pose other quality-of-life issues for residents).

,, When approaching an intersection in which a car going in the opposite direction is stopped, possibly with a green light (but not a green arrow) to turn left in front of you - then ride assertively through the intersection. Do not accelerate towards an intersection. The car driver will expect you to be traveling at a speed near the speed limit and altering your rate of approach may confuse him, causing him to mistakenly think he has time to make his move before you arrive on the scene. Do not make eye contact with the driver of the vehicle. Just about every rider who has been run into at an intersection will swear that the driver was looking at him, that he had made eye contact with the other driver. Worse still, if you establish eye contact with the driver, he may think ""he's seen me, so he'll give way!""


Move away from the car, especially if he is turning left across your path from the middle of the road. This provides a lateral movement that tends to attract the driver's eye and the further you are away from the car, the further he has to travel to move into your path. Remember, distance equals time and time equals options!
Despite temptation, do not slow down or hit the brake (unless it is clear that you must in order to avoid a collision). Braking may confuse the driver into thinking that the stoplight is turning yellow for you and encourage that driver to proceed left, resulting in a potential collision.

, Whenever possible, accelerate to large open spots on the road that possess the sparsest number of vehicles, or brake to let traffic pass and use an open area behind traffic as an invisible bubble of abundant free space which is as far from the collection of vehicles as possible.

, When riding on multi-lane divided interstate highways, the safest lane to ride is the far left lane (if there is a shoulder). The far right lane is subject to vehicle constantly merging on to the highway and other vehicles exiting.


The next lane over from the right is subject to abrupt last-minute lane changers who decided not to exit of the highway - at the last minute and into the same lane as the motorcyclist. Other middle lanes can be somewhat safe, as they offer multiple escape routes, but middle lanes also carry the risk of twice as many vehicles (sets of vehicles on each side) who might potentially merge into a motorcyclist's lane.
If the far left lane does not have a shoulder (therefore one less escape route) then the middle lanes may be safer. If the far left lane includes a shoulder, then the shoulder is a good escape route and subjects the motorcyclist to cars on three sides, not four (front, back and on the right only).
However more aggressive drivers may be more likely to abruptly merge into the left (passing) lane due to impatience with the flow of traffic, and this same impatience can also cause the driver to fail to acknowledge a motorcyclist already occupying that lane (or cause an aggressive driver to not care if he pushes the motorcyclist aside).
Therefore it is even more important to never ride alongside a car when riding in the left-most passing lane, as at any time, another vehicle may abruptly dart into your lane.
Watch the movement of cars ahead of you in relationship to where they are in their lane and if they keep making short movements to look around other vehicles or ride closer to their left lane line. When passing alongside other cars to your right, pass them quickly to minimize the window of opportunity for an abrupt lane changing car to collide with you and your motorcycle. Ride alongside car gaps in the next lane, or if necessary, alongside the drivers front left quarter panel closest to the driver where he or she can see you the best.
Never ride in another driver's blind spot alongside the rear of a vehicle.
Also pay attention to highway exits that are on the left, as cars will be merging to exit and entering the highway occasionally from the left also.

, When something like a large pothole, animal, random object etc or even another vehicle endangers one of the two riders where the rider must swerve to avoid a collision or crash, the rider right next to you is taking up your safety zone. A swerve is now impossible and you will either wreck or swerve into the rider next to you, causing two riders to crash or injury. A staggered formation is best as it gives room to maneuver and creates a larger visual for drivers to see. Only when coming to a stop at a light/sign etc should riders be parallel.

Look for bike traffic.,
Yield to cyclists on sidewalks.,
Use caution around kids on sidewalks.,
Respect cyclists in the middle of the lane.,
Pass safely.,
Execute safe right hand turns.,
Be careful at stop signs.,
Be safe when performing left hand turns.,
Watch for bikes in your blind spots.,
Open car doors with caution.",How to Share the Road With Cyclists," The first step to sharing the road with a cyclist is to know that they're there. When you are backing up, look for someone of a bike. When passing another car, look for a bicycle. They have a right to be on the road, so look for them.;
, If a cyclist is on the sidewalk, be careful. Before you pull out of an ally, driveway, or parking lot; yield to a cyclist on the sidewalk.

, Kids really are unpredictable. Especially kids who are learning to ride a bike. They may swerve out into traffic, try to pop a wheelie, fall, or a number of other unexpected things. Drive slowly, and be prepared to stop!

, Why would a cyclist be in the middle of the lane? Aren't they supposed to stay to the side? Yes, but there may be hazards on their part of the road. Broken glass, construction barricades, parked cars, pile of dirt or leaves; all these things that motorists don't have to worry about, will make cyclists get into the middle of the lane. Don't follow them too closely, and watch for hazards on the side of the road. If a cyclists needs to get into the lane to avoid these dangers, or make a left-hand turn, let them do so.

, When passing a bike, you have to keep at least three feet in between your car and the cyclist. When moving at high speeds, slow down and give them more room when you pass. The wind draft off of your vehicle can suck them towards you. One more situation where a bike needs more room would be going up a hill. Cyclists have to pump harder to get up a hill, and this usually means the bike rocks back-and-forth a little. Give them more than three feet.

, Don't cut in front of bikes. Sometimes, when cars want to make a right turn, they speed up to get in front of the bike, only to hit the brakes when they turn. Be patient. Slow down, wait for the bike to pass, and then make the turn.

, When a car stops at a four-way stop, they usually look for other cars. However, cyclists have just as much right to use the road as a car. If the bike came to the intersection first, it gets to go first. If it's on the right, and both the car and the bike arrived at the same time, the cyclist has the right of way.

, Again, patience is key. Bikes are smaller and thus are harder to spot. Before you make a left-hand turn, scan the area closely for cars and bikes. Also, because they are smaller they look farther away, and most motorists think cyclists move fairly slowly. (However, bikes can easily be traveling at 25–30 mph (40–48 km/h).) So be patient, and be careful when judging the distance and speed of oncoming bikes.

, Because bikes are smaller, they are harder to see than a car. Blind spots can completely hide a bike. Make sure you check over your shoulder for bikes in particular, before turning, passing, or merging.

, Would you believe that some of the worst car-bike incidents are conflicts between cyclists and car doors? It's true. Many cyclists are injured each year by either having a car door hit their bike from the side, from behind, or by running into it as it's opened. Look for cyclists before you open the door.

Make sure your driver is experienced at riding with a passenger, aka ""two-up"".,
Wear proper clothing!,
Wear a proper helmet!,
Wear some sort of eye/face protection.,
Always wear gloves.

When stopped, DO keep your feet on the foot-pegs.,
Don't keep your head too close to the driver's, or you'll bump heads when the bike slows down.,
At normal driving speeds, the driver will not be able to hear you unless you shout VERY LOUD.,
DO let the driver concentrate.,

",How to Ride on the Back of a Motorcycle," Driving with a passenger is very different from driving alone. This is not the time for you to teach each other new skills.;
, Even if it's hot, you want a leather jacket and (at least) blue jeans. Wear high-top leather boots if you have them. This is your only protection against road rash and (more likely) exhaust-pipe burns.

, Laws or no laws, how much is your head worth?

, At driving speed, hitting a large bug can feel like getting hit with a golf ball.

,,,, Almost all passenger seats are too high for the passenger's feet to reach the ground easily.

,,, Put your hands on the driver's shoulders for balance if needed.

,,,,, DON'T take them off. Even if you can reach the ground it doesn't help the driver.

, Just as motorcycles accelerate faster than cars, they decelerate faster, too.

, You might want to agree upon a certain shoulder tap or something if you need to get his or her attention.

, DON'T backseat drive.

Don't ever leave your motorcycle running, even for a few moments.",How to Protect a Motorcycle From Theft," Even though these locks are easy to break into, they should still be used in conjunction with other methods of protection.;
, Disc brake locks are attached so that thieves cannot ride your bike away.

, For example, you can pull a fuse, loosen a spark plug cap, or shut off the gas. Hopefully, the thieves will assume that your bike is broken, or they may just give up trying to figure out the issue.

, A kill switch has to be pressed while the rider starts the bike.

, Ideally, leave it where you can see it if you are going into a restaurant. At home, be sure to park your motorbike in a discreet location if you don't have a garage at home. You might want to cover the bike with a tarp, especially if you have invested a lot of money into fixing up your bike. You don't want interest to turn into temptation.


If possible, park it somewhere that is not easily accessible. If it's hard to get to or move the bike from, it will be less of a target. The little extra inconvenience to you can be worth it.

, Another option would be to link your wheels to a friend's bike with a chain.

, It only takes a few seconds for someone to jump onto your bike and ride off. Don't hide your keys anywhere on your bike either.

,
Read the alarm manual, and test all the functions you installed to prevent motorcycle theft.

",How to Install an Alarm System on a Motorcycle," Alarms come with many different features, including those that detect a change in the position of the motorcycle to those that have GPS. The highest-ranked alarm, the Scorpio SR-i1100, allows you to create a ""bubble"" around the motorcycle that senses motion and also protects any baggage on the bike.


Look for alarms that have battery backups as a starter immobilizer to stop thieves from hot-wiring the motorcycle.;
,, Compare the wiring diagrams of the alarm system and your motorcycle side-by-side, and acquaint yourself with the color coding used on your bike.

, Remove the wires that you will not be using from the work area to reduce clutter and confusion.

, Do not completely wrap the wires, and make sure you leave room at the end as some wires go to different locations.

,, Tie, strap, or tape the module into position. Some alarm systems will come with sticky pads to use, but you may want the extra protection of another strap.


Do not place the module closer than 12 inches (30.5 cm) to the engine.
If you're using the sticky pad provided with the alarm system, clean the area well with rubbing alcohol and allow it to dry completely before applying the pad.

Practice slowing down and stopping.",How to Ride a Motorcycle (Beginners)," Your motorcycle helmet is the single most important piece of equipment for motorcycling riding. It protects your head from injury in the event that your motorcycle goes down. For it to do its job, the helmet must fit well, while maintaining your field of vision. The best helmet for you is an individual thing. To get the desired protection, get a helmet designed for motorcycle riders that meets established safety standards. It does not need to be the most expensive helmet to do the job of protecting your head. A motorcycle helmet that meets the DOT (U.S. Department of Transportation) or ECE (Economic Commission for Europe) standard is designed to do the job of protecting your head in an accident. These two standards are rigorously tested for the required safety standards to ride on public roads. Additional safety features add to your protection and comfort. Some riders prefer the Snell brand of helmets because they meet higher safety requirements (as set by the not-for-profit Snell Memorial Foundation), including performing at higher speeds and on harsher surfaces.
To find the right size, get a professional fitting at a store that specializes in motorcycle equipment. Alternatively, you can measure yourself by using a soft measuring tape to measure around your head about 0.5 inches (13 mm) above your eyebrows. Compare your head measurement to the measuring table of the brand that you wish to buy. Note that each brand differs in their sizing, so consult the sizing table of each brand that you are considering.
To find the right fit, try on the helmet. The correct fit puts the eye port just above your eyebrows with a very tight fit of your finger between your head and the helmet. Your helmet needs to have a snug fit to protect your head properly. Different helmets fit different head shapes. If your helmet is the right size but uncomfortable in the fit, consider a different one. For the most comprehensive protection, look at full face or modular helmets.;
, A motorcycle jacket protects your torso, including your internal organs, in an accident. Motorcycle jackets are made of leather or manufactured materials, such as Kevlar. Look for a jacket that has impact absorbing body armor. If the jacket carries a CE (Certified European) mark, it has met certification standards for sale in Europe.

The best fit of a motorcycle jacket is snug through the torso with free motion in your arms. Consider the environmental conditions in which you will use this jacket for riding, so the weight and features meet your needs. For example, warmer weather jackets have more zippers and vents to allow for adjustment of airflow around the body.
If you opt for a leather jacket, make sure it’s motorcycle specific. Regular leather jackets aren’t built to protect you.
Besides protection, jackets also provide protection from environmental conditions, such as sun, wind, precipitation, and cold temperatures. Staying comfortable keeps you alert and makes the ride more enjoyable.







, Both pieces of equipment provide greater safety and comfort while riding. Boots provide protection to your feet and ankles. Gloves provide protection to your hands. Pants provide protection to your hips and legs.


Your feet can take a lot of abuse while riding, so protect them. Proper motorcycle boots cover your ankles and have non-slip soles with an integrated metal toe. Use the grab the toe and heel and twist test to see how your boot selection might perform in a crash. The less easily it twists the more protection that the boot provides you in an accident.
The purpose of gloves is to reduce injury from being hit by insects and flying debris, as well as keep your fingers warm. Get ones that allow for maximum dexterity. Look for ones with a retention strap around the wrist. This strap is designed to keep the gloves on your hands in a crash. Kevlar gloves will keep your fingers mobile while being strong and absorbing.
Pants are often overlooked. Jeans are designed more for style than function; thus, they often shred in accidents. A better choice is pants made from the same materials as your jacket. They are designed to take on the destructive forces of an accident.

, A course gives you the best instruction to learn proper riding technique and safety. It is highly recommended as a starting point for all new riders. It is only a requirement for your license in some states, so whether this is a requirement for you depends on where you reside.


New riders with little or no experience can take a basic rider course. Check your local government's department of motor vehicles and transportation to see if courses are available in your area. Basic rider courses offered by your local government may not always be available in your area. However, there are usually non-government run courses available. A training course may provide you with a motorcycle to use if you don’t have one. The course will also teach you the basics of operation and safety.
Many courses consist of both a classroom and riding portion, ending with you taking a test to receive your license.

, Familiarize yourself with the basic controls before riding. When you’re actually riding you will have to think quickly, if you’re not familiar with the operations it could be dangerous.


The hand clutch lever is typically located on the left handlebar and is used to disengage the power from the rear wheel when shifting gears.
The gear shifter is typically located by your left foot and is used to shift one gear up or down while you’re pulling the clutch lever.
The throttle is on the right handlebar and used to accelerate. The handbrake, which applies the brakes to the front wheel, is the lever on the right handlebar.
The lever on the right side of the bike near your foot works the rear brake.
As a rule, the left side of your motorcycle controls gears, while the right side controls acceleration and braking.

, To properly get on your bike, face the motorcycle from the left side. Grab the left handlebar, and swing your right leg over the seat. Plant your feet firmly on the ground.


The best way to get to know how a bike operates is to sit on it and go over the functions of the controls before starting it up.
Get a feel for how you fit on the motorcycle. Grip the handlebars, clutch lever and brake lever. Make sure you can reach these controls comfortably. Your arms should have a slight bend in the elbow when gripping the handlebars. Switches should be within easy reach of your fingers.
Make sure you can easily plant your feet on the ground. Get a feel for the weight of the bike underneath you. Additionally, you should be able to operate the rear shifter without lifting or sliding foot off the peg. , The clutch is used to change gears. When you pull the clutch in, you’re releasing the engine from the transmission. This action puts your bike in neutral, allowing you to shift gears.Think of your clutch as a dimmer switch when using it. Unlike an “On-Off” switch, you want to gradually and smoothly pull and release the clutch to prevent your bike from stalling.
When starting, pull in the clutch lever and put the bike into 1st gear by pushing down on the gear shifter with your left foot. You may have to push down several times. You'll know you're in 1st when you don’t feel any more resistance or indication the gears are moving.
Most motorcycles operate in a “1 down, 5 up” shifting pattern. The pattern is typically 1st gear, neutral, 2nd gear, 3rd gear, and so on. When shifting gears you will see the appropriate number light up on your gauge.
When you’re driving, you should shift gears by first pulling on your clutch with your left hand to disengage the rear wheel. As you pull the clutch, reduce the throttle. Reducing the throttle will prevent your bike from jerking as you re-engage the rear wheel. Continue by shifting gears with your left foot. Feather the throttle with your right hand to keep the transmission smooth. Finally, release the clutch, engaging the rear tire.

, Pull the clutch lever in and locate your kill switch. This is usually a red switch located on the right handlebar. Flip it down into the “on” position. Most modern bikes don’t require you to kick start your engine, but if you have an older bike you may have to. The kick start lever, if you have one, can be found behind the foot peg on the right side of your bike. Turn your key to the “ignition” position and check to make sure the lights and gauges are on and operating.
Put your bike into neutral. The easiest way to do this is to downshift to 1st gear then shift up once. Look for the “N” on your gauge to light up.
With your right thumb, push the “Start” button. This is usually located under the kill switch. Start buttons are often identified by a circular arrow with a lightening bolt in the middle.
Once the engine has turned over, let your bike warm up for about 45 seconds so the engine will work properly.
When your feet are flat on the ground, pull the clutch lever back in. Then roll back onto your heels and repeat until you have a good feel for the clutch.

, Start with your feet in front of you and on the ground. Slowly let the clutch out until the bike starts to pull itself forward.


Using only the clutch, walk the bike forward, keeping it steady with your feet.
Repeat this until you can keep the bike upright when you pull your feet off the ground. You want to get a good sense of balance on your bike.

, Once the engine has started and warmed up, you can begin to ride. This is done by shifting down into 1st gear and letting the clutch lever out while simultaneously pulling back on the throttle.Make sure your kickstand isn’t out.
Slowly let out the clutch lever until the bike starts to roll forward.
You may have to pull back on the throttle slightly to prevent your bike from stalling while releasing the clutch.
Once you are moving, accelerate slightly and pull you feet up onto the pegs.
Try straight line riding. As you let the clutch out and slowly roll the throttle back to pick up a little speed, continue riding in a straight line. When you are ready to stop, pull in the clutch lever, and slowly apply the front and rear brakes simultaneously. Use your left foot to steady the bike at a stop. When you are stopped, put your right foot on the ground.

, Once you’re able to start riding in a straight line, get a feel for shifting. Get a feel for the ""friction zone"". The friction zone is the area of resistance created as the clutch becomes engaged. This area allows for the transfer of power from the engine to the rear wheel. Motorcycle transmissions are sequential, meaning that you have to shift one gear in a consecutive order, whether shifting up or down. It will take some practice to be able to feel and hear when it's time to shift. The engine will start revving at higher rpms when it's time to shift.With your bike on, shift all the way down into 1st gear. You’ll know you’re in 1st gear when the shift pedal doesn’t click down anymore. You should hear a bit of a clicking noise when in 1st.
Very slowly let your clutch out until the bike starts moving forward. When you want to start moving faster, pull back on the throttle slightly as you let out the clutch.
To get to 2nd gear, pull the clutch back, ease off the gas, and pull up firmly on your shifter to move through neutral. Check to make sure your neutral light is not on. Let the clutch out and engage the throttle again. Repeat this process to shift through higher gears.
After 2nd gear, you don’t have to pull up with your left toe quite as hard since you’re not going through neutral.
To downshift, release the throttle, squeezing the brake lever slightly. Pull your clutch in and press down on your shifter. Then let out your clutch.
Once you get a hang of downshifting, you can come to a stop while in second gear. Then, once at a stop, shift down again into 1st.

, Much like a bicycle, a motorcycle is turned, once you're at about 10 mph or higher, by countersteering. Push down on the handgrip on the side of the bike you want to turn. Look up and through your turn.


As you enter your turn, remember to slow down. Don’t apply the brakes during your turn. Release the throttle and break if you have to before you start your turn.
Keep your head up and look through the turn. Press the handlebar in the direction you want to go. Slowly roll on the throttle as you glide through the turn to keep momentum.
As you slow down, turn your head to look to the end of the turn. Your bike will follow your eyes. Find a point at the end of your turn to aim for and keep your eyes on it. Never look at the ground or down into your turn. Though you may feel weird and want to watch your turn, this is dangerous and can cause you to not complete your turn properly.
Press on the side you want to turn. If you are making a left turn, push away from yourself on the right side of the handlebar. This will cause the bike to lean to the left. Lean with it and slowly roll on the throttle to slightly increase your speed. As you come out of the turn, keep the throttle steady or add a bit more gas while you lean back up. Let the bike right itself, don’t jerk the handlebars.

, Finally, now that you’ve practiced starting, shifting, and turning your bike, you need to know how to slow down and come to a stop. Remember that the lever on the right handlebar operates your front brake, while the brake by your right foot operates the brake for the back wheel. As a general rule, you want to begin braking with your front brake and employ your rear brake after to help you slow and stop. When coming to a full stop, it’s best to begin with your front brake and apply the rear brake after you’ve slowed down some.
As you slow down, make sure you downshift. You don’t always need to go all the way into 1st gear. You can downshift into 2nd gear and stop before shifting down to 1st.
Pull in the clutch when braking and gearing down.
Apply pressure to both your front and rear brake as you slow down and begin braking. Make sure you aren’t pulling back on the throttle. This is made easy by the fact that the front brake handle is situated so that you have to roll your hand forward to reach it.
Gradually increase pressure on your brakes, don’t engage the brakes completely, this can cause your bike to stop abruptly and jolt.
Once you are at a stop, keep the front brake engaged, and plant your feet firmly on the ground. Start with your left foot, then your right.

Do your research by consulting all the resources available, such as the internet, the yellow pages, the DMV, police department and municipal court.,
Opt for an established riding safety school with a strong and respected reputation.,
Seek recommendations from friends who also attended safety riding courses.,
Make sure that the school you choose is accredited and recognized by a national organization, such as the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.,
Select a riding safety school with experienced instructors.,
Inquire about the quality of the bikes that are used and whether they are maintained regularly and replaced when they become unsafe.,
Confirm what you are expected to bring with you and what the school provides you with as far as equipment.,
Find out what kind of surface you will be training on.",How to Choose a Motorcycle Safety School," All of these resources offer listings of local motorcycle safety schools, although the last 3 can provide a list of recommended schools.;
, If people and organizations are talking positively about a safety riding school, then that is an optimistic sign that you should take into consideration when making your final decision.

, Personal testimonials from former students are a great way of selecting schools because they have first-hand experience. Friends also have nothing to lose by telling you that the school is not so good.

, This will ensure that you will receive the best quality motorbike safety training. Additionally, attending a recognized motorcycle safety school may entitle you to discounted insurance rates.

, Ideally the riding instructors should be commercially licensed and accredited, and should have more than the 3 year minimum riding experience requirement. Veteran riders can offer more varied training based on their vast scope of experience. You also want to know where school instructors received their basic training, how advanced they are, and how often they teach.

, You also want to make sure that the school provides a bike size that you can ride. Often, beginner courses provide the bikes and mandate that you use them, whereas intermediate classes allow you to bring your own bike, so make sure that you will be comfortable learning on the bikes that are provided. The last thing you want is to learn on a heavy cruiser if you are of a small build, and you also don't want to ride a light street bike if you are of a larger build.

, Many motorcycle safety courses provide you with the helmet and gloves, but many will expect that you bring and wear riding boots before getting on a bike., Since you will most likely be riding on the road, you really want to train on asphalt or concrete. This will better prepare you for a real driving experience.

Motorcycle Lighting: Good lighting is a crucial factor in your safety.,
Check your headlight aiming angle.,
Add dual running headlights to your motorcycle.,
Consider replacing your headlamp bulb with a super bright DOT approved model.,
Add reflective tape to your bike.,
Consider your driving technique: Are you speeding so fast you will not be able to stop in time?",How to Safely Ride a Motorcycle at Night," Safety comes through increased road presence. While your bike is 1/12 the size of a typical SUV, there are some steps you can take to increase your visual road presence to something much larger. It's a fact that larger vehicles are easier to see and avoid. With the steps here, you can greatly improve your road presence and help avoid an accident with another motor vehicle. The most common cause of accidents and death for motorcyclists is a motorist turning left and into the pathway of the biker. Other types of common accidents are at intersections and rear end collisions. The techniques here are designed to improve your day and night presence and help other motorist see you.;
, Those black leather jackets look good in the day, but for the night, you might want to consider wearing something that reflects light. Consider adding a fluorescent highlights on the back of your jacket, a smart message maybe. Your helmet is also a nice place for the same.








, In the quest for stylish lighting, many manufacturers use undersized brake lighting and most will aim the headlight lower to the street than the legal angle allows. Your first step is to examine your front and rear lighting. If you have a tiny brake light, consider replacing the light with a larger model. If this is not possible, J.C. Whitney sells a halogen brake lamp for about $10.00 that is 30% brighter than stock bulbs. You can also buy super bright LED lighting that is much brighter than the typical automotive bulb. However, this lighting should be purchased from a specialty company and not the ""garden variety"" LED arrays you can find at some stores for $15.00 or less. Ultra Bright LEDs are expensive when using true Ultra Bright LED (light emitting diodes). Expect to pay more if you want a truly bright LED system. Custom Dynamics is one such supplier of premium LED lighting.








, Check your state regulation on aiming. Raise the beam to the maximum angle allowed by your state. You can do this without special tools by up-righting your bike and casting the headlight on the wall of your garage. Measure from the ground to the exact center of your headlight, then adjust the beam projected on the wall (high beam). A rule of thumb is to drop 2"" for every 10 feet (5 cm every 3 metres), but you should check with your state to conform with their regulations.








, Three properly aimed headlights are much more noticeable than a single headlight.








, Some bikers have been known to replace their headlight bulb with a non-DOT approved off-road lamp which is 40-50% brighter than the brightest legal lamp.








, You can also purchase reflective decals and add reflective flame decals to your helmet.








, Are you driving between vehicles waiting at a red light to get in front of the traffic? Are you racing with other motorcyclists? Are you trying to show off in front of a large group of people?

These courses teach you how to avoid accidents, how to crash safely, and how to deal with the aftermath. Many countries have motorcycle safety organizations or government agencies that offer safety courses. Do an online search to find one in your area.


For example, the Motorcyclist Safety Foundation offers beginner and advanced courses all over US.
In England, the government offers “Enhanced Riding Schemes,” or courses that are designed to improve a rider’s safety.;
, Many drivers have trouble spotting motorcycles on the road, whether because of a blind spot or because they’re not paying attention. Whenever you’re driving near a car, assume that the rider cannot see you.For example:


Stay away from potential blind spots by riding in front of or behind a car.
When a car is backing up, assume they won’t see you in time to stop. Let them finish and then continue on your way.
If a car is merging into your lane, give them space. If they can’t see you they will run you over.

, If you’re not sure where a car will turn, look at their wheels. The angle of the wheel will indicate where they want to go next.This information can help you avoid many accidents. For example:


You will be aware of cars trying to turn left on top of you.
A rider can see whether a driver will try to change lanes at an intersection.
If the car is backing up, you will know what direction they will most likely go.

, This can include cars, rocks, and other debris. By being watchful, you will give yourself enough time to avoid anything that you see on the road. For example, if you’re riding on a small country road, keep an eye out for any cars parked in your lane. Other dangerous road debris include:


Patches of gravel
Puddles of water
Oil on the road
Large branches on the street

, Be aware of what’s going on behind you by checking your mirrors. It can be tempting to keep the eye on the road in front of you at all times. However, you can benefit from knowing what’s going on behind you. For example:


If a car is speeding, they may come up behind you quickly and startle you.
A car behind you may turn on their blinker, indicating that they may merge on top of you if you don’t pay attention.

, Many motorcyclists are hit at intersections by cars turning left on top of them. In fact, this is the most common type of motorcycle and car collision.To avoid getting hit, keep an eye on approaching car’s blinkers and give them plenty of room to turn.


If a car turns left near you without using their blinker, you may need to speed up or swerve to avoid them.

, A large amount of motorcycle accidents happen at intersections. Therefore, you need to be able to brake at a moment’s notice when approaching a stop. Position your hands over both the front and the rear brakes as you stop to decrease your reaction time.

, Many cars overlook a motorcycle that’s parked at a light. To avoid getting hit, create a buffer between you and oncoming traffic by pulling in front of the car in front of you. Make sure to give the car a friendly wave as you move around them. Other methods of stopping at intersections include:


Stopping between traffic lines so that cars can’t hit you
Stopping to the side of the lane, giving you an escape route

, What seems like a convenient time saver is actually a recipe for disaster.This is especially important when riding between an active lane and a lane of parked traffic. The dangers of riding between these cars include:


A car door opening, blocking your path
A car unexpectedly merging into another lane to escape traffic and merging on top of you
A driver cutting in front of you to merge, blocking your way

, If you’re going through a turn too quickly, you may end up flying off the road. To prevent this from happening, avoid driving too quickly to correct a bad turn. The faster you’re going, the less time you’ll have to adjust for a sharp turn. Use visual clues such as light posts and telephone polls to help you gauge the severity of a turn.


If you find yourself in this position anyway, don’t slap on your brakes or chop the throttle. Instead, lean into the turn and try to ride it out., Half of the motorcycle accidents in the U.S. involve alcohol. Statistically, the best way to avoid an accident is to drive responsibly.Avoid drinking any kind of alcohol when riding your motorcycle.


If you’ve had too much to drink, play it safe and call a rideshare or taxi. It’s better to have to come back for your motorcycle than get in a fatal accident.

, It can be tempting to race down the road at top speed. However, if you go too fast, you won’t be as aware of the road. For example, if you’re speeding, you may not have time to swerve and avoid a patch of gravel. Other dangers include:


Not being able to turn properly because you’re going too fast
Running into a car, person, or animal
Hitting a patch of water and hydroplaning

, Do an online search to find a specialized motorcycle gear store in your area. When you visit the store, an associate will help you choose gear that fits and that meets safety standards. If you buy your gear used or online, you don’t have a guarantee that it will protect you. Always wear your gear, especially your helmet. Safety gear includes:


A motorcycle helmet
Riding boots
Gloves
Leathers (protective leather clothing)
Body armor, Additionally, if your motorcycle starts to make a strange noise or if you have trouble steering, see a mechanic. If you don’t, you may have an accident. Other regular maintenance includes:


Regularly changing the tires to prevent skidding and sliding
Changing the oil whenever needed
Rotating the tires if they are out of alignment

, Many riders are unprepared for any accident scenarios they encounter. If you practice braking quickly, the motions will be second-nature when you need them. First, find an empty parking lot or long, unused road. Practice speeding up and slamming on your brakes. When braking, keep your steering straight and your braking constant.


Start at smaller speeds and increase them as you become more comfortable with braking. For example, start by braking at 5 miles an hour, then moving to 10 miles an hour.
Some people believe that the best way to stop your motorcycle is to turn it on its side and slide. This is a dangerous, outdated method of stopping.

Identify the goal of your motorcycle cruise-in.,
Create a time line.,
Determine locations.,
Get sponsors.,
Create promotion material.,
Decide on other activities to take place during your ride.,
Put safety first.",How to Organize A Motorcycle Cruise In," Verbalize the goal of your event up front so you can plan properly. Goals can include raising a certain amount of money to support a local charity, raising awareness of motorcycle safety, or simply allowing your local chapter to take a motorcycle ride together.


Decide how non-riders can be involved with your event. Some people who do not ride motorcycles will still want to support your cause. Find a way for them to volunteer or help out.
Estimate the number of riders and other participants you would like to attend. The size of the motorcycle ride will affect how long the ride is, the stops you make along the way, the price you charge, and more.;
, Give yourself plenty of time to plan, get appropriate permissions, and promote your motorcycle cruise-in. You can then delegate some of these tasks to other committee members who are helping you plan.


Start with the potential date of the event and plan backward. Check for conflicts. There may be other motorcycle rides, fundraisers, or other major events happening in your community that might compete with your event.
Decide when to start promoting your cruise-in and when to start recruiting for volunteers.
Make sure that you leave time to get sponsors and for things to be approved by local businesses or government officials. It is important to do these things before you start promoting your event.

, This includes where the motorcycle cruise-in will start, where it will end, and the stops you will take during the ride.


Parks and local businesses are prime locations to begin or end your motorcycle ride. Again, be sure to get permission from the appropriate business owners or local government officials. This includes any city or county event permits you may need. File for these in ample time to secure them prior to your event.
Stop at locations where riders can get drinks, snacks, and gas, as well as to use the bathrooms. It may be helpful to place volunteers at each stop, especially if you are doing a poker run or bingo.

, Companies who sponsor your motorcycle cruise-in can help cover the costs. Ask them to donate specific things, like food, napkins, or drinks. Get your sponsors in advance so you can be sure to advertise them on all of your promotional materials. Be clear about what each of the sponsors will provide as part of this sponsorship such as financial donations and advertising.

, Determine how you will best reach your target audience and design materials that will be effective for that group. Options include posters, radio ads, websites, banners, t-shirts, and more. You can provide these materials at local organizations and motorcycle chapters. Have a graphic designer help you so your materials look professional.

, Raffles, lunch, music, and other entertainment are all optional activities for a motorcycle cruise-in and may help you raise more money if you are supporting a local charity. Delegate these activities to your event committee members or sponsoring organizations.

, This is especially important during a group motorcycle ride. Have access to a first aid kit. At least one rider should carry a cell phone. Require all riders to wear helmets and follow motorcycle safety guidelines and state and local laws.


Use hand signals. Hand signals are passed back from one rider to another. Make sure everyone understands and uses signals during the ride, as it is hard to hear one another over the sound of your motorcycles.
Keep a safe distance. Stagger riders from left to right and stay at least two bike lengths back from the rider in front of you.
Delegate captains if your group is large. These riders can lead smaller groups of motorcyclists in a much safer way.

Find a suitable and rideable Harley Davidson motorcycle.,
Decide how you're going to get your Harley, either by borrowing, renting, or buying.,
Observe the bike.,
Get on the bike.,
Start the bike.,
Ride the bike.,
Enjoy the ride.,
Find a road all your own (preferably deserted and without any traffic), and ride until you feel good.,
WEAR YOUR GEAR!!",How to Ride a Harley Davidson," Not every Harley is suitable for 'cruising' or riding distances shorter than a few blocks or miles. If you really want to enjoy all a Harley has to offer, find a Harley that runs well, is comfortable, and one that you can handle. If you find the bike too heavy, drop down a level or improve your riding skills on another, smaller bike first. In general, the bike ""heaviness"" runs in the following order, from heaviest to lightest:


Touring. (Includes Road King, Street Glide, Ultra Classic, Limited and Road Glide).
Softail (Includes Fatboy, Heritage, Slim, Deluxe and Breakout)
Dyna (Includes Street Bob, Low Rider, Fat Bob, Switchback and Wide Glide)
Sportster (Includes 883's and 1200's)

A note about the Sportster: Some consider it the most difficult to ride, despite its lightness. This is due to its relative unbalance and high placement of the gas tank thus raising the center of gravity. Despite this, it remains one of the most fun Harleys to ride, and is exemplified in carrying the honor of being the longest running production motorcycle in United States history.

;
, Sometimes renting or borrowing (provided that you have a motorcycle license) is the best way to introduce yourself to the world of Harleys without a huge financial commitment.

, Look at the subtleties and richness of the chrome, or lack thereof, and special features unique to the design of the particular Harley you are going to ride. Prep the bike for ride by checking the gas level, tires, lights, and any obvious flaws or defects.

, Remember, ""right is wrong."" Get on the bike from the left side, as it is good etiquette. (BS. Getting on from the right is the only ""correct"" way. It is how professionals are trained, and if you slip, you will not shove the bike over) Feel the handlebars, feel the weight of the bike underneath you. Pull the choke if need-be. Then...

, Listen to it. Feel it underneath you. Let it warm up as you warm up to the bike.

, See the road scurry underneath you. Feel the wind in your face and on your body. See how it's just much better when on the bike. Feel the rumble in between your legs. Lean back. See the blur of the side road as you look straight ahead.

, Harley Davidson motorcycles enjoy a rich and storied tradition. Riding one is not about the speed or handling of the bike per se, but rather, the enjoyment of the feel and embodiment of the entire experience. Look at the scenery, hear and feel the engine. Look to your right... to your left. Even look up at the sky - all the while making sure to keep another eye on the road to stay safe. Beware of 'cagers' ie. car drivers.

, Then ride some more. Stop at a tavern (no alcoholic beverages,please). Visit a friend. Enjoy the freedom of riding a Harley Davidson. When you're done, bring it back and ride again another day.

You will have to be used to using the front brake with only one or two fingers in order to downshift this way.,
After you begin braking, pull in the clutch and select the next gear like you would normally.








,
Here is the tricky part.,
Remember to keep braking smoothly with your index and middle fingers.








,
When the engine is revved up slightly, let the clutch back out to engage the next gear.,
If the bike jerks forward when you let the clutch out the engine was turning too fast.,
If the bike rapidly slows, the engine wasn't turning fast enough so you need to rev it more before releasing the clutch.








,
Repeat each time you shift down a gear.,
Finished.








",How to Match Rev Downshift a Motorcycle," It is best to use your index and middle fingers to brake while keeping your ring and pinky fingers on the throttle.






;
,, Still holding the clutch in, use the palm of your hand and/or your ring and pinky fingers to rev the engine slightly.








,, The goal here is to match the revolutions of the engine to what they need to be to travel the same speed in the lower gear. This smooths the transition between gears and eliminates the need to slip the clutch quite as much.








, Don't rev it as much next time.








,, This technique is especially useful in the lower gears, which generally have a wider gap between gear ratios.

, Once again, just doing it on a regular bicycle is safer, but on a motorcycle it's a lot more dangerous.

, If you do a sharp turn, it will increase your chance of falling off, plus, the motorcycle will fall.

Check for other issues that may be preventing the bike from starting.,
Put the bike in 1st or 2nd gear.,
Hold the clutch in and begin pushing.,
Release the clutch and hit the starter.,
Rev the engine.,
Ride away.",How to Push Start a Motorcycle," Before trying to push-start your bike, it can save time in the long run to quickly check for the types of problems that won't be helped by push-starting. For instance, it only takes a second to make sure that your bike isn't starting because it's out of gas - simply check the gas gauge. Below is a short checklist that you may want to run through before push-starting - if one of these conditions is not true, this may be the reason your bike isn't starting:









There is fuel in the tank.
The petcock is set to ""on"" (more pertinent to older bikes).
The kickstand is up.
The transmission is in neutral.
The kill switch is set to ""run"".;
, Push-starting requires the bike to be in a relatively low gear. For most bikes, 2nd gear is the easiest gear for push-starting, though it is usually also possible in 1st gear. Rarely, some bikes will even be easier to start in 1st gear than in second.









Usually, if your bike is parked, it's in neutral - you can tell whether this is the case by pushing it forward. Neutral is the only gear that allows the bike to roll forward without holding in the clutch. To shift from neutral to first on a manual bike, depress the clutch and press down on the foot control. To shift from first to second, depress the clutch and press up on the foot control.

, Most guides recommend getting the bike to a speed of at least 5 mph (8.0 km/h) for a successful push-starting. This will require a stretch of open space in front of you, so clear the area of any obstructions before beginning. You may also want to leave plenty of space on either side on the off chance that you lose control of the bike after it starts.









You can reach push-starting speed quite easily by allowing the bike to roll downhill. In this case, rather than running beside the bike and pushing, you would ride the bike. If attempting a downhill push-start, take care to ensure that you don't lose control of the bike.

, Once you've gathered enough speed, release the clutch and hit the starter button in one smooth motion as the bike is rolling. Give the bike a moderate amount of throttle. As soon as the bike starts, engage the clutch again to prevent the bike from getting away from you.








, Now that you've got your bike started, you don't want it to die again. With the clutch depressed, rev the engine at a medium level so that your bike doesn't choke down or go dead.









Revving the engine has the added effect of charging your battery if the reason your bike wouldn't start is because the battery was dead.

, Once you've got your motorcycle running, it's unlikely to stop again unless you turn it off on purpose or stall the engine. If your battery was drained, riding your bike around and/or revving your engine can help restore some of the charge, preventing the need for future push-starts.









Before turning the bike off, be sure to address the underlying issue that caused the bike not to start in the first place (or at least prepare to do so). A bike that requires push-starting to start may have problems with the battery or fuel system that can require the attention of a mechanic. For instance, if your bike's battery is on its last legs, you may want to ride your bike to the nearest mechanic's to get a new battery before turning it off.

Take advantage of an already-working motorcycle and chop it to taste.,
Purchase and customize the rolling chassis.,
Install the drivetrain of your choice.",How to Build a Chopper Motorcycle1,"


Running the original motorcycle allows you to maintain registration or licensing more easily, as you are running an original manufacturer’s vehicle with their registration numbers.
Ride the motorcycle, get a feel for what you like ""as is"" and what you want to modify.






Modify any original parts, taking advantage of the original mounting brackets and hardware.






Add or subtract parts as time and money allow, while keeping the bike in running order, to minimize down time and prolong your riding enjoyment.





;
, A rolling chassis includes the frame, both wheels, the front forks, handlebars and clamps that hold the bars to the forks, and customize with body work and drivetrain.


The registration numbers belong to the frame, so you can start either with a salvage project from an original manufacturer, or with an aftermarket manufacturer specializing in rolling frames.

,


As the wheels, front suspension and frame already work together as a unit, you know what drivetrain will fit the basic dimensions of your bike, lessening the guesswork involved.

Prepare for added time, effort and space.",How to Build a Chopper Motorcycle2,"


This option may appeal to first-time builders in particular, as all the parts are designed and built to fit together; the manufacturer can address problems or warranty issues.

,
Have a well-lit, uncluttered space you can dedicate solely to the project. You will be building in stages, leaving you with a partially assembled chopper in this space for a long period of time.






This option may cost the most up front, as you will be purchasing most or all the components of a new motorcycle at the same time.

Develop a solid relationship with a speed shop.",How to Build a Chopper Motorcycle3,"


Usually only advanced mechanics take on this option, as it entails a lot of time, resources and skill. Experienced chopper builders also understand what works or fits together and what doesn’t.

,


Look for a large motorcycle shop or even a junkyard that has a dedicated area for motorcycles as a starting point, both as a parts source and a place to turn to for advice.

,


Get mechanical assistance in building or rebuilding drivetrains, creating or modifying custom body parts and painting or plating bare metal.

Evaluate your surroundings and conditions.,
Practice braking regularly and in various weather conditions and scenarios.,
Use traditional motorcycle braking instructions to stop under normal conditions.,
Recover from a wheel lock when braking while driving.",How to Brake Properly on a Motorcycle,"









Look ahead at the conditions of the road. Are there any obstacles in your way? Is the road hot? Is there any water on the road? Is there gravel on the road? Consider the age and tread of your tires. Are they at full tread and optimum stopping capability or do they show some age? All of these conditions alter your stopping length and your bike's braking reaction.
Brake carefully under slippery conditions. The technique for braking in wet or slippery conditions is the same; however, the distance needed to make the stop increases.;
,









Become a master at controlling your motorcycle. The more often you brake, the more comfortable you will become with the action and the better you will be able to carry out the process successfully in any given situation. You will be more capable of controlling your bike. Practicing motorcycle braking techniques will enable you to be more confident handling your bike in emergency situations.
Set up braking drills. To become better accustomed to the braking needs of various conditions and how the bike maneuvers during harder and harder stops, take time periodically to do braking drills. Find a secluded parking lot or empty street to practice on. This will help you become better acquainted with difficult situations like braking while cornering.

, The distance required to stop is lengthened as your speed increases.









Place gradual pressure on both the front and back brake simultaneously. Most of the stopping power is in the front brake so more pressure should be put on it compared to the back one. A majority of the weight on the bike is now transferred to the front. This happens because the shocks compress, increasing the traction on the front tire.
Release the pressure off the rear brake, and increase the pressure on the front brake. As the motorcycle slows down, the weight will lift off the front of the bike, bringing the suspension back up. If you do not release the brakes, you will be in danger of locking up your tires.
Let off the front brake slowly and compensate by applying slight pressure to the rear brake and releasing them together.

,









Keep the brake held in position during a rear wheel lock. Steer the motorcycle straight until the motorcycle comes to a stop.
Let off the brake gradually if the front wheel locks. Do this until the wheel releases and the bike comes to a stop.

If you're a new rider, you should consider the weight of the bike, as well as how tall it is. You want to be able to put both feet down on the ground when you come to a stop.


Bikes come in all shapes and sizes. When shopping for your bike, think about how you want to ride it. Do you want something you can cruise around on, or do you want something a little more extreme? If you're looking to tour around on a bike, opt for a traditional motorcycle. If you want something with speed, consider a sportbike.Start looking at various manufacturers' websites to find the specifications of bikes. Select a few you're interested in and compare them to find one that suits your needs.;
, Motorcycles can range from under $5,000 to $25,000. Before you drop thousands of dollars on a motorcycle, do some research on the going rate for the bike in question. You may find a cheaper alternative.Consider buying a used bike if this is your first time buying a motorcycle. When you're learning to ride, you run the risk of laying your bike down at some point. If you buy a used bike, you won't feel so bad if it gets a little dinged up. Once you get the hang of riding, you can swap your bike for something nicer.Keep in mind that you will have to pay a few other fees for owning a motorcycle aside from the cost of the bike. There are title and registration fees, sales tax, and in some cases, a delivery fee. If you buy used, you may have to pay for some maintenance if the bike needs any work done., After you buy your bike, you'll need to invest in a helmet. While there are plenty of other riding accessories available, a helmet is essential.When shopping for a helmet make sure you buy one that has a good fit. You want your helmet to be snug around your cheeks and jaw, as well as the top and sides of your head. Be wary of used helmets, as they may not offer as much protection due to wear and tear.Other riding accessories include riding jackets, boots, and gloves. The more you can protect yourself on a bike, the better off you will be. Shop for jackets and gloves that have armor sewn into them. Armored gear offers the most protection if you do end up in a crash., Depending on which state you live in, the rules for getting your motorcycle license may vary. Some states require a motorcycle safety course before giving potential riders their license. Check with the Department of Motor Vehicles to find out what the requirements are in your state., There are motorcycle clubs, and then there are riding clubs. Each club offers something different for members.Riding clubs are for people who only want to ride. You meet with some other members, ride around, and that's it. There are rarely any other commitments when you join a riding club.Motorcycle clubs are more social. They value forming bonds with your fellow members, creating a brotherhood of sorts. Motorcycle clubs tend to require a lifelong commitment to the club. There are often dues involved, as well as required attendance to club-sponsored events., You can find clubs for a wide variety of interests. There are clubs based on anything from the type of bike you ride, to what you do for a living. Check online to find information on any club chapters that may operate in your area., Depending on the type of club you are interested in, you may have to apply for membership. Some riding clubs are free, while others may require dues.If you want to join a riding club, all you have to do is approach your local chapter and ask what it takes to join. If you can't find a local chapter, you can start your own. If you find enough members, you can become an AMA (American Motorcycle Association) certified group.Motorcycle clubs can be much more difficult to join. Some motorcycle clubs recruit members by invitation only. If you want to join an established motorcycle club, find out where the local chapter meets and start hanging around. Introduce yourself to some of the members and get to know them. If the members get along with you, they may ask you to join.Motorcycle clubs often get bad press because they can sometimes resemble gangs. While there are several motorcycle clubs that operate on the wrong side of the law, not every motorcycle club is bad. Before you join any club, do your research and make sure you know what you're getting into., A big part of both clubs is group riding. Group rides offer companionship and great views, but there are some rules to follow.Make sure your group plans the ride before setting out. Discuss things such as destination, how long you plan to ride, or where you'll be stopping.Follow a set riding order, with an experienced rider in the lead. Less experienced riders should be right behind the lead, with veteran riders next. This way, the experienced riders can keep an eye on the new riders., Pay attention to your surroundings and take care to stay out of any blind spots on the road. Avoid weaving through traffic, or riding on the shoulders.Drivers should be keeping an eye out for bikers, but do your best to make yourself visible on the road. For extra safety, always assume that you're invisible to other drivers.Always follow the local traffic laws. Don't speed, and always keep an eye on the traffic ahead of you., You should never ride your motorcycle without wearing the appropriate safety gear. Even if you're going down the street, wear your helmet., Handling a motorcycle requires more skill than driving a car. Drinking before riding your motorcycle will hinder your ability to ride safely.Don't be fooled into thinking that you can ride if you've only had a few drinks.

, If you have a bike that allows you to carry a passenger, make sure you are skilled enough to carry them on your bike. Give your passenger a helmet, and make sure they're comfortable riding with you."

Keep your arms relaxed and parallel to the ground.,
Anchor yourself to the bike using your knees.,
Plan your turn.",How to Countersteer (Motorcycle)1," You don’t want to be pulling down on the handle bars. If you do that, you’ll essentially be fighting against the bike. If the road is bumpy or has potholes then your handlebars are bound to jerk around a little bit. Allow for these small movements. , Since you won’t be gripping onto the handlebars with your arms really tightly, it’s important to anchor yourself by hugging the motorcycle with your knees. It doesn’t need to be a death grip, just enough to keep you sturdy. You can also hold down on the pegs with the heels of your boot.

, If you have to decelerate, downshift, or, worst of all, brake, in the turn then you have entered the turn too quickly. Brake before the turn, consider your entering strategy, and then enter it smoothly. You may want to enter the turn differently depending on the camber of the road and the type of turn, but generally use the delayed apex strategy. This means entering the turn on the outside and then scooting back to the inside as you clear the apex of the turn. "
"
Push the handlebars on the direction you want to turn.,
Use the delayed apex strategy.,
Slow your bike before turns.",How to Countersteer (Motorcycle)2," If you want to turn right, push the handlebars on the right side. If you want to turn left, push the handlebars on the left side. While this may seem incorrect, turning the bars in the opposite direction from the turn forces the bike to tilt slightly, while maintaining the proper speed allows it to stay upright. Memorize this countersteering mantra: Turn right, push right. Turn left, push left.

, As you approach your turn, signal at least 100 feet (37 meters) before the turn, and check your mirrors for signs of traffic. Move to the outside third of your lane–the corner opposite the direction of your turn. Don’t go so far that you’re putting yourself in danger of oncoming traffic. Just chose the outer third so that you can enter the turn with enough room to swing back to the inside.

, Turning on a motorcycle is dependent on the speed you are traveling, so it's important to brake on your approach to the turn, then hold steady on the throttle during the turn. Downshift before the turn if necessary, but never in it. You can shift into a higher gear during the turn if you want to, but don't do this until you get more comfortable.


The balance of the motorcycle is gyroscopic, which means that speed keeps it up. Depending on the grade of the turn you're making and the speed at which you're traveling, you'll probably need to slow down some.
Never, under any circumstances, should you slow in the middle of a turn, or brake in the middle of a turn, unless there's some emergency. Even then, it's safer to evade than to attempt to stop. If you absolutely must stop then level your handlebars out before you start to brake. Square your handlebars and then apply progressive pressure to both brakes at the same time. 70 % of your stopping power comes from your front brake, but don’t grab it – especially in a turn. Apply progressive pressure. "
"
Push the handlebar to the direction of the turn.,
Keep your head up.,
Maintain a steady throttle.,
Look through the turn.,
Accelerate out of the turn.",How to Countersteer (Motorcycle)3," This means that if you are turning right, you'll want to push the handlebar to the right. This is different than turning in close quarters. You are essentially keeping your handlebars square but initiating a lean. Gently, increase pressure from your palm on the handlebar, pushing it gently. Logically it may seem as if you were trying to turn the bike in the opposite direction you want to turn. However, as you do this, lean gently into the turn while shifting your weight slightly in the direction you want the bike to tilt. Again, while that may seem counterintuitive at first, this is the principle of counter steering, turning the front wheel slightly to drop the bike into a gentle lean, which allows for greater stability during a turn.
The sharper you want to make the turn, the greater your lean angle should be.

, Maintain pressure on the handlebars and look through the turn to the road ahead of you. Avoid looking at the side of the road or other distractions as target fixation can cause you to go directly toward it. Look at the path in the road you want to be on.

, Don’t decelerate during the turn or let off the throttle. You don’t have to speed up in the turn, just keep the throttle steady. If you need to let off it at all that means you entered the turn too fast. Try to have confidence in your bike. Just because it is leaning doesn’t mean it’s about to fall over – as long as you keep pressure on the throttle you should keep friction with the road. By holding down the throttle you’re pushing that back wheel into the road and keeping the bike steady.

, Don’t look at the ground. If your vision is wrong you’ll end up crashing. If you look at the ground, you’ll go to the ground. Keep your eyes where you want to be going – that’s not directly ahead of you, that’s at the exit point of the turn. Vision is incredibly important while countersteering. , When you are exiting the turn, release some pressure on the inner handlebar and add some more pressure on your throttle. Now push slightly on your outer handlebar and your bike will come back upright. This doesn't need to be a dramatic push back to the outside, just a slight nudge as you release pressure on the inside handlebar.

"
"
Apply your front brake before the grade.,
Lean and countersteer away from the turn.,
Adjust your body position.,
Accelerate into the turn.,
Right yourself by countersteering toward the turn.,
Throttle up.",How to Countersteer (Motorcycle)4," To stay stable in turns at high speed, it's common to apply only your front brake during the downshift. This should occur on the outside of the lane, opposite the direction you want to turn, and in the straight, just before the grade begins. You should immediately transition from slowing into accelerating into the turn. Higher torque engines have a tendency to spin out in the back tires, so depending on what kind of motor you've got, you may want to downshift more, accordingly. Listen to your bike and get a feel for its capabilities at speed before you try to push it.
This section assumes racing road conditions and dry asphalt.

, As you approach the grade, countersteer away from the turn and lean toward it, at no more than 45 degrees on the angle. You shouldn't have to throw much weight, but you might need to adjust your body position slightly to maintain stability at higher speeds. , More aggressive turns such as those done by competitors on sports bikes may require riders to adjust their body positions, such that the torso is parallel to the bike on the right side, and dropped low beside the fuel tank. Position your head correctly. The helmet should be in a position near the right handlebar and the right leg cocked outward on the peg at about 45 degrees, with the ball of the foot on the peg and the heel up against the bike.

, As soon as you secure yourself in your lean, accelerate the motorcycle through the apex of the turn. Keep your lean angle as stable as possible and accelerate the bike up slowly throughout the turn. The gear you use will depend on many things, the style of the bike, the road conditions, the grade, and the speed that you're traveling. There's no one gear for turning fast.
Maintain a stable lean throughout the apex of the turn, dragging your knee if necessary. The right knee may drag on the ground if properly equipped and the lean angle is aggressive enough, in competitive racing.

, As they exit the grade, racers will right themselves by countersteering back the other direction, into the direction of the turn which was just completed. This should allow you to pop up into a stable, upright position and throttle up. Shift your body back to a centered and low position on the bike for stability.

, Most of the time, you'll need to shift up immediately after a turn to continue accelerating at high speed, having drifted toward the outside edge of the track again.

Spray protectant on your bearings.",How to Wash a Motorcycle," Spraying water all over a hot engine is a recipe for disaster: the sudden change in temperature can crack the engine block. Even if you’ve just gone down a wet country road and your motorcycle’s caked in mud, let it cool down before you begin., While you’re waiting for your motorcycle to cool down, why not grab the supplies you’ll need to clean it? All of the supplies you’ll need can be found at your local auto or motorcycle shop. Make sure to gather:A bucket
A clean sponge or two
Several clean, dry cloths (chamois or microfiber)
Degreaser and/or WD-40
An old toothbrush (to help clean tight places)
Auto/motorcycle wax (optional)
Bug and tar remover (if needed)
Chrome cleaner (if needed)

, If your motorcycle has a chain, getting the dirt and grease off of it first is a smart move. This keeps the grime from splashing all over the rest of your bike while you’re trying to clean it. Use an approved chain degreaser if you can find one at your local shop. Spray it on the chain to loosen debris, then wipe it away with a clean cloth.








WD-40 will also work as a solvent to loosen grease and dirt.
Make sure to apply lubricant to your chain again once you are done cleaning your motorcycle.

, Before starting on the body, take care of any other nooks and crannies around the engine area that need special attention. Dip an old toothbrush in clean, cool water and gently scrub dirt and debris away. Spray WD-40 on the gunk if you need extra help removing it.








Generally, however, keep away from the brake lines and bearings. Getting water into these areas can cause corrosion and other problems.

, This will help loosen any dirt and rinse as much of it away as possible, making the cleaning process easier. Just make sure to use a gentle stream of water from a hose. High-pressure sprays can damage the finish, paint or other materials, and should be avoided.







, A little elbow grease at this point will help remove additional grime. Dip a sponge or soft cloth in a bucket of cool water, and wipe it all over the body of your motorcycle.








If you are cleaning your bike to remove salt from it (such as after riding on a winter road), just use water in this way, then skip to waxing it. Using detergents or other cleaners might make the salt problem worse.

, If your motorcycle has plastic parts on the body, it’s just fine to use an approved auto detergent. Add some to a bucket of cool water, and wipe the parts with a sponge dipped in the suds.







, After you’ve cleared off all the muck and grime from your bike, grab your hose again. Use a gentle spray to wash away the last of the dirt and any traces of suds. If there’s not much to clear off, you can also dip a clean sponge into clear, cool water, and use this to rinse the bike.







, Take a dry chamois or microfiber cloth and gently rub down your motorcycle. This will wick away the water left on it, so that there won’t be any water spots left as your bike air-dries.








Don’t let your motorcycle dry in direct sunlight, since this can also cause water spots.

, Motorcycle seats can be made from a variety of materials. Vinyl and leather are the most common. Vinyl seats are quite tough, but can fade and crack over time. Use an approved vinyl protectant to halt these problems. Leather seats are more delicate, but using a leather care cream will protect yours.Protectants for vinyl and leather can be found at any auto or motorcycle supply store.
Do not use detergents on leather.

, Any biker knows that a nice ride can leave your motorcycle looking you waged war against a swarm of flies. If your motorcycle is caked in bug goo, soak it liberally with bug and tar remover. After the grime is loosened, use a soft sponge or cloth to wipe it away, and another damp one to remove any leftover residue., Many modern bikes have lightweight aluminum wheels. If you want to clean yours, use only soapy water and a soft cloth. Rinse with water and wipe with a dry cloth.Abrasive cleaners or tools can damage the finish or paint on wheels, so avoid these.
If you have traditional chrome wheels, use chrome cleaner instead.

, A quality wax can protect the finish of your bike and keep dirt and grime away. Apply this after the rest of your bike is thoroughly cleaned. Follow the directions on your commercial wax spray or rub. Each product will have slightly different instructions., The bearings are one of the most important but delicate parts of a motorcycle. A dedicated protective spray will help coat the bearings and keep moisture and dirt at bay. See your chosen product’s package for the exact application instructions.

Try to find out if the motorcycle has been abused before taking the time to go see it.,
Listen to the motor run.,
Look carefully at the back sprocket.,
Ride the motorcycle.,
Operate the controls and feel for binding or weakness in the cables.",How to Buy a Used Royal Enfield Motorcycle," This may require a bit of psychology. Ask the seller if the motorcycle ""is fast."" If he replies ""I've had her up to 75 mph (121 km/h) all the time,"" you have your answer. Consider why people sell Royal Enfields, often with very low mileage. It may be because they didn't realize stock Royal Enfields cruise best under 55 mph (89 km/h). The seller may have abused the motorcycle by trying to keep up with friends on faster bikes.;
, Royal Enfield valves can be heard opening and closing but they should not clatter. If the seller explains excess noise by saying ""Oh, they are just out of adjustment,"" suggest that he adjust them for you right there and then, ""so you can learn how."" It is a bad sign if he won't do it, or can't. If he suggests you ""take it to the dealer"" for that, ask ""can we take the cost of that off the price, then?""

, If the teeth show any sign of narrowing it will have to be replaced. You can't see the front sprocket, but it will be just as worn and reaching that one is a tough, messy job if you do it. It is several hundred dollars if you pay a mechanic to do it. If you see wear here (and you will if the bike is near or beyond 30,000 miles (48,000 km) for sure) figure that into the price.

, If it starts, stops runs and rides the way a motorcycle should there are only two special things to check for while test riding a Royal Enfield. Any ""pinging"" on acceleration is a bad sign. It is easy to adjust the timing to get rid of that. The danger is that the seller may have been riding the motorcycle with pinging, potentially damaging the piston. Listen, too, for a slight knocking noise in the motor that comes only when you are riding and let off the throttle. If it's consistent and unmistakable it could mean a bad main bearing, a very expensive thing to repair.

, Cables are not extremely expensive to replace but Royal Enfields are notoriously hard on clutch cables and a broken one can strand you. Ask the seller if he has a spare cable he can ""throw in"" to help make the deal. He won't need it anyhow.

Sportster: designed for speed and fun; the entry-level Harley, good for beginners.
Dyna: a cruiser for longer rides; comfortably seats two; larger engine than Sportster; combines traditional and custom appearance; prices can vary, but lower-end Dynas are an affordable way to get a Harley Big Twin engine.Touring: smooth riding for long distances or day trips; powerful engine; can seat two comfortably; features may include stereo, windshield, etc.
V-Rod: liquid-cooled motor designed in cooperation with Porsche; power cruiser with a unique, hydroformed frame.
Softail: the hidden rear suspension harkens back to the traditional ""choppers"" of the 1960s; powerful Big Twin engine.The Street: introduced in 2014 in India; lightweight model is geared towards riders looking for a powerful yet affordable bike.;
, Model specifications can change from year to year. The more knowledge you have about what you are looking for, the better the chances that you'll be happy with what you purchase. There is a wealth of information on Harleys, both in print and online.


Read about Harleys online. Read up on the history of Harleys, plus industry reviews, user reviews, forums, and more.
Browse books and magazines on Harley-Davidsons. There is plenty of print material on Harleys, including books and periodicals that specifically deal with the buying process. Check out your library, local bookstore, or online booksellers.

, While the list of all specifications and features is extensive, learning the most important can help you narrow down which model is right for you. It can also help you better navigate the buying process.


Motor/engine size: expressed in cubic inches (ci) or cubic centimeters (cc): this measures the cylinder displacement as pistons move from highest to lowest point.
Big Twin engine: a Harley term for non-unit engines; that is, they do not share casing with the gearbox components; more powerful.
Twin Cam engine (also known as Fathead): Harley engine that has more than one camshaft in the engine for increased performance.Fuel mileage: how much fuel the bike uses per mile.
Saddlebags: bags towards the rear of the bike; helpful if you need to carry things on your bike.

Windscreen or fairing: helps protect rider from the wind and rain; can make long rides more comfortable.
Crash bars: hoop-shaped bars that help keep the bike off the rider in the event of a crash., You can research this online or in a phone directory.

,


Alternatively, start your search online by looking to see if your local dealership has its inventory posted for viewing. This can be a less stressful shopping method because you don't have the pressure of an actual salesperson. You can contact the dealership for additional information by phone or email if you find something that you like.

, Freight and setup fees are legitimate, but you should not be charged handling fees, administrative fees, or documentation fees.

, Every dealer receives this score quarterly, and it can give you a good sense of how the dealer treats its customers after sale., You can arrange this either through the dealership or a local lending institution.


Make sure that you have your credit scores reviewed before attempting financing.
Don't be afraid to obtain multiple quotes from banks, and then use them as leverage to get a lower rate at the Harley dealership.
If possible, use a down payment to offset the financing that you will have to do.

, Many of the Harleys built in the past 25 years are still on the road.That leaves you a wide range of choices when it comes to pre-owned Harleys, and also speaks to the durability of the bike itself. Purchasing a used Harley-Davidson can be cost effective if you buy from a fair seller.

, You can look online, or through sections of your local or regional newspaper.


You can also pick up a regional auto trader magazine to see if they have any Harleys for sale. These publications can generally be purchased at gas stations or convenience stores in racks by the door.

, Look at pricing guides that focus on motorcycles, such as NADA.


Another thing to take into account is the cost and availability of spare parts, so you'll need to research these as well. You can research this online, or consult a professional mechanic.

, It should start easily, and the ride should be comfortable. Evaluate the overall performance, including acceleration, braking, motor sound, and handling. Make sure the lights, blinkers, gas tank lids, brakes, kickstands and mirrors are in working order.

, Check for things that might negatively affect the value.


The wiring and engine should be intact, clean and rust-free.
The drive belt, drive shaft and chain should be clean, without cracks or rust.
Check the condition of the tires: is there traction, or are they worn?
Is the exterior free of rust, dents and scratches? These could be signs of poor maintenance or collision.Bring along a friend with mechanical experience to help you make a clear assessment of the vehicle before purchasing. Alternatively, ask the seller if they would consent to having a mechanical check before you purchase.

, Mileage is a major factor in determining market value, so make sure the mileage quoted is accurate and the bike priced accordingly.

, Ideally, there should be written records of maintenance, major repairs, etc. Try to get a sense of how well the owner has taken care of the motorcycle.

, The Vehicle Identification Number allows you to access the full history of the bike, including ownership, accidents, and major repairs.


Several companies, such as Carfax, offer this service. Although a detailed report does cost some money, the information you can glean makes it well worth the cost.
You can do this online, or check with your Department of Motor Vehicles for an approved service., If you are fully confident that the motorcycle is in good condition and fits your needs, purchase your Harley.


Don't be afraid to walk away if you aren't comfortable with this particular bike. You'll find the right one sooner or later!

Reflect on what you want to do with your bike.,
Pick whether or not you want to go with a new bike or a used one.,
Determine the specific size and style of engine you want.,
Research various sources for pricing on the specific brand, make, model and engine size.,
Decide on new or used if either is within your price range.",How to Compare and Buy a Motorcycle," If you are interested in long scenic trips and highway driving, you will want to look for a touring or a cruiser with a large engine. You will need the power for speed and highway driving. If you are a thrill seeker, a sportier bike is for you. These are light and nimble, and probably a little easier to handle. If off-road racing and hill jumping is your game, then you will want to focus on dirt-bikes.;
, The type of the bike you are interested in should make a big difference here. A used dirt bike can sometimes be picked up on the cheap end; a used cruiser however, is still likely going to cost you a little. A new cruiser though, will cost you a significant amount of cash. You need to have an immovable price point though, that you will not cross over, not even by a buck.

, Straight line or V-Twin makes a difference in handling and speed and will determine which brand you can purchase.

, You need to have 1-3 specific bikes to choose from that you definitely want. If 1 or more is within your price range, this will help you weed out any above that, as well as give you an estimate on what you can expect to pay. At least you have a benchmark at this point.

, With new, you will obviously need to go to a dealer; with a used bike, you will have options. In almost all situations, you will probably get the best price on a used bike from a private individual; however, you will get peace of mind from a dealer - to a certain extent. A dealer can offer you a warranty that could help you in the event you have mechanical issues or purchased a lemon. A private individual would likely be cheaper, but you won't exactly be able to return it or have the buyer pay for the repairs.

Decide what type of riding you will be doing most often: commuting, sports, touring, or a combination.,
Buy from a reputable dealership if possible.,
Check the bike out for yourself.,
Take a test drive.,
Inspect the bike again after the ride, looking for any leaks or drips.,
Request a service history.,
Be realistic when negotiating on the final price of the bike.",How to Buy a Used Motorcycle," This is the most important criterion you need to consider. Be honest with yourself on this one. A 1000 cc super bike might make your heart skip a beat, but there is a very good chance that you will hate it on the commute, and that your pillion will be uncomfortable on it. Track-days on a cruiser may also be disappointing.;
, Private sales may be lower priced, but you will not have any comeback if the bike breaks down or blows up. Most dealerships offer some type of warranty, or at the very least, will work with you should anything go wrong in the first few months of buying. If you must buy from a private party, insist that you be able to take the bike to a reputable dealership to be assessed and inspected. A few dollars spent now could save you heaps of money and trouble in the future. In addition, dealerships can do an ownership history search for you to make sure the bike in question wasn't stolen and hasn't been listed as ""written off"" by an insurance company.

, Take some simple hand tools with you, including a flashlight and, if possible, a multimeter.


Check the condition of the drive chain and sprocket. The chain should have around ¾"" of play (up and down) and the teeth of the sprocket should not show obvious damage or wear. Try to wiggle the chain side to side on the sprocket. There shouldn't be much movement on a good set. Have someone sit down on the motorcycle and check to make sure the chain is somewhat snug, with very little movement up and down. Chains wear out over time, but sprockets should last much longer. A severely worn sprocket indicates either an old sprocket or a poor maintenance schedule.
The tires should have good tread all the way across the surface with no signs of uneven wear or damage. Daily drivers' tires will often have more wear in the middle on the tread (more highway driving). Others who've raced their motorcycle on the track, will have tires that show more wear at the edge of the tread.
Sit on the bike. Look at the condition of the brake and clutch levers, bar-end weights, straightness of the bars and instrument cluster. These could be signs of an accident or drop. Others could be scratched engine cases, foot pegs or exhaust pipes. Hold the handbrake and bounce the front suspension. It should feel even and firm. Get off the bike and check the fork tubes for signs of rust, pitting and oil. These are signs of worn fork seals, or possible future expensive problems.
While checking the forks, run a fingernail across the brake rotors, feeling for uneven wear or grooving. Look into the brake caliper to see how much of the pads are left. If the bike has spokes, check the overall condition of the individual spokes. For all types, look for dents or damage to the rim
Put the bike on its center stand if so equipped; turn the bars side to side. Feel for any 'notchy-ness' or roughness in the steering head.
If possible, check the visible frame; remove the seat to see underneath it also. There should be no dents, kinks or visible damage to the frame. If there is, walk away.
While the seat is off and you can access the battery, clip the multi-meter across the battery terminals and check the voltage. It should read no less than 12 volts. Start the engine. The meter should read no more than 14 volts or so while running. If it does, that may be a sign of a 'dodgy' voltage regulator and it may overcharge a battery and cause it to fail. Check the lights and indicators at this stage also. Pull a fuse or two out and check for corrosion. Do this with the engine off of course. Also, check the battery terminals and overall appearance of the battery. Replace the seat.
Open the fuel tank and check for obvious signs of rust or corrosion using your flashlight (not a match or lighter).
Inspect under fairings (if the motorcycle has fairings). Remove the same fairing the owner removes to change spark plugs and do routine maintenance. Check the frame for fatigue at the weld points. Inspect the overall condition of the engine block, plugs, and radiator. Check for leaks around the oil filter and oil pan bolt.
Look at the brake fluid level. This is usually on top of handlebars, in an enclosure with a clear window. With the engine running, pull hard on the front brakes level and release while watching the fluid level. It should fall and rise. It should rise quickly once the brake is released.

,


Pick a nice day with dry roads and good visibility if possible. Bring your bike license and proper gear if you have it. Most dealers will have loaner gear available for you to use. If at a dealer, be prepared to sign an insurance waiver; if privately, be ready to leave your license with the seller as security.
Pick a route that you are familiar with that has light traffic and good road conditions if possible. Start slowly and get used to the way the bike feels and responds.
Test the brakes. They should not 'pulse'. That is a sign of warped disks. They should engage smoothly and evenly and not grab violently or feel spongy.
Accelerate through the gears. The transmission should feel firm and not slip out of gear under acceleration or feel 'clunky'.
While on a straight, clean patch of road, weave left and right slightly to see how the bike responds. It should feel stable and easy to correct.
Listen for any unusual engine noises, suspension creaking or rattling and any undue vibrations. Ask questions about anything you have doubts about.

, Check the oil, through either the sight glass or; when the engine cools, the dipstick if so equipped. Most semi or full synthetic oils will darken after only a few miles. That is completely normal.

, It is always a good thing to have, but for several reasons, they may not be available. Ask for an owner's manual and factory toolkit if available.

, For a private seller, this may be his baby and insulting him now will ensure that you will not get a fair price. If at a dealership, realize that the salesperson may have targets to meet and a boss looking over his shoulder. Do some research online; use the retail pricing guides if available, or read the bike classifieds to get a fair market value of the bike. Then, set your buy price accordingly.

Soak the bags in hot water for 30 seconds in a laundry sink or bathtub.
,

Stuff the bags with newspaper.It will take at least one Sunday edition.
,

When wet, mold the top back into shape.
,

Leave to dry for at least one day.

Optional Step.,

If you want to maintain the shape longer you can put stiffeners in as follows:

Cut out the shape(pattern) of the flat saddlebag top piece and the saddlebag front from the plastic sheet, making the pattern 1"" smaller on the outer edge so the plastic piece fits onto the top and front.",How to Repair or Reshape Your Motorcycle Saddlebags1,",,,,, Grind off the buckles from inside the bag and pull the buckles away from the bag.This will allow the stiffener to lie flatter against the leather. If you feel confident about pop riveting or bolting the buckles back on then go ahead and grind off the buckles. Otherwise it is not absolutely necessary to remove the buckles., You also can substitute luan, or 16ga-24 ga metal in place of the plastic. The purpose of the plastic is to keep the bags shape once the bag is dry.
Apply one coat of contact cement to the inside front of the leather bag and one coat to the stiffener. Let dry. Apply another coat. Push the pieces together almost immediately after applying the cement. Do not let the cement dry before pushing the pieces together. Work fast.
Drill 5/32"" holes through the leather and stiffener to provide holes for pop rivets or small bolts(8-32 used with acorn nuts), use washers under the bolt or pop rivet head and washers on the other side as well to increase the holding strength. Use three across the top of the front and a couple lower down. Paint the rivets or bolts if desired to help disguise them . Also install two on the right side and two on the left side of the top.
To reinforce the sides, cut plastic strips about 4-5"" wide x12"" long and cement from the top of the sides. Secure with pop rivets or small acorn nuts and bolts.

Can you ultimately be satisfied with the purchase?,
Where can you find the right motorcycle for you?,
If you are buying a new bike, follow these tips:


Find a dealer with a good reputation.,
How will you pay for the motorcycle?,
Final tips.,Enjoy your motorcycle and have fun!",How to Buy a Motorcycle," There are several questions to take into consideration when choosing a motorcycle.


Do you really want or need a motorcycle?
What is your price range?
What is an appropriate displacement, weight and type within your skill set?
What is the intended use for the motorcycle?
Should the motorcycle be new or used.
If used, what is the condition of the motorcycle?
Can you ultimately be satisfied with your purchase?
Where can you find the right motorcycle for you?
How will you pay for the motorcycle.;
, A motorcycle is a unique form of transportation which is not for everyone. The first question you must ask yourself is do you really want to ride a motorcycle and why? Only you can answer those questions. One of the best ways to arrive at the answers is to do some research first.


Go to your local library and check out books on the subject, such as ""Proficient Motorcycling"" by David Hough.
Speak to motorcyclists and ask them about their experiences, both positive and negative.
Watch documentaries about motorcycling such as ""On Any Sunday"".
Also discuss this new interest with your family and loved ones to get their input. Your decision will affect them too.
If after following these steps, you are convinced that motorcycling is right for you, the next step is to see what you can afford.

, To determine what you can afford, first make a monthly budget.


Determine what your cash assets are.
Write down your total post-tax income and then your expenses.
Subtract your expenses from your income and the remainder (minus a portion as a safety margin), is what you can afford each month.
Multiply the monthly amount by the number of months you intend to take in order to pay for the purchase. It should not exceed 60 months.
You may apply your cash assets towards the total purchase price.
It's important to include a safety margin in your calculations. That way your purchase will not cause a hardship. Also it will increase your chances of being approved for financing. Your safety margin should include additional expenses such as yearly registration, insurance, maintenance and fuel.

, Motorcycles come in a wide variety of sizes, weights, styles and performance levels. It's critical, both for your enjoyment and your safety that you choose the right one for your intended purposes. Follow these guidelines:


Am I a beginning or experienced rider?
Do I want to use the motorcycle for sport & recreational use, cruising, long distance touring, commuting or off-road use?
Although not critical, your physical size should be taken into consideration as well. Are you tall, short, heavy or light?
Generally speaking if you want a motorcycle for long distance use, you should find one with adequate displacement (>750cc) and which is equipped with some kind of luggage and wind protection.
If you prefer a cruiser, then a motorcycle with a low frame, low seat and a motor with good low-end torque is the best choice.
For commuting, a standard or sport bike will make a good choice.
For sports riding, a sports bike is designed for that genre.
For off-road use, or on/off road use, choose any number of dirt bikes, enduros or motards.
As a rough guide, avoid any motorcycle in excess of 500 pounds or 70 horsepower if you are a beginning rider. New riders should especially be wary of buying a sport bike. A sport bike has a lot of power, light weight, sensitive controls and are not a good learning tool. They are not forgiving. Instead try a standard until you've gained enough mileage and experience to feel confident and safe.

,


If you are a beginning rider - it's often best to start with a good, low mileage used machine. This way if you accidentally drop it, or if you outgrow it and need a bigger, more powerful bike later, you haven't lost much in depreciation and repairs. In many cases you may be able to sell your used starter bike for nearly what you paid.
If you're an experienced rider, first ask yourself if you're mechanically inclined and enjoy repairing your own machines? If so, a slightly to moderately used bike may be a good choice, which could save you lots of money. You may even desire a much older classic motorcycle which will only appreciate with time.
If you're not mechanically inclined and desire reliable day-to-day transportation, then a new bike may be the best choice for you. A new bike often has the added advantage of benefiting from better dealer incentives and financing terms.

, With any used motorcycle, there is a degree of risk. The history of the motorcycle, including regular maintenance, how it was used or even any accidents may be difficult if not impossible to determine. These tips may help:


Ask the owner lots of detailed questions.
Although many owners/dealers will not permit this, it doesn't hurt to ask for a test ride on the motorcycle. Only ask for this if you're an experienced rider with a current motorcycle insurance policy that will cover damages in case of a mishap.
Ask to see any maintenance logs or receipts.
Ask if the mileage is accurate.
Examine the title closely for any previous owners and transfers. Make sure the information on the title such as the vehicle year, model and VIN are correct. Make sure there are no lienholders. If the motorcycle doesn't have a clear title - walk away.
Examine parts on the bike such as the chain, sprockets, wheels, exhaust system, footpegs, handlebars, grips, levers and bodywork for signs of equal wear, damage, new or mis-matched paint, scratches or signs of recently replaced parts. These usually indicate an accident or possibly higher than indicated mileage.
Look carefully for signs of corrosion.
Check for any oil or coolant leaks.
Ask to hear the bike start and run. It should start easily and idle well once warmed up.
Check to make sure that the brakes, clutch, throttle and electrical equipment work properly.

, As with making any large purchase, you need to be happy with your choice, as you may be living with this purchase for a number of years. Your answer should be ""yes"" to all of these questions:


Is this a motorcycle you will be proud of?
Can you envision this motorcycle in your garage for years to come?
Is this the type of bike you can picture yourself on when you go riding with your friends?
Will you still believe this is the ""right"" motorcycle for you 5 years from now?
After conducting enough adequate research on this machine, are you convinced that it will be reliable enough and perform to your standards?
Will this motorcycle do what you need it to do?

, If you are looking for a used bike, there are classified sections in local papers and numerous on-line resources, such as Craigslist, Motorcycle Trader and eBay. If you are searching for a new bike, finding a dealer is as easy as doing a web search for the brand you want on line or searching in the yellow pages. Here are a few tips:


If using the classifieds, Craigslist or other venue, be very careful to avoid a possible scam. Always meet the person in a public place and never alone. Let someone else know exactly where you are going. Never give another party a personal check, which will have your bank account number on it. Either bring cash and be prepared to ask for a signed receipt, or bring a cashier's check for the exact amount.
Remember if buying on eBay, that it's an auction site, so you will be paying top dollar for your purchase. Once you win the auction, you are obligated to complete the transaction, so be prepared to follow through. Pay close attention to any shipping fees, especially for large items like motorcycles. Ask lots of questions about the item before you place a bid.
If using an auction site, do not bid with your emotions. Do not exceed your limit, no matter how nice you believe the bike is.
Always research bike values first by using Kelly Blue Book or the NADA guide. You can find their information on-line or at your local library for free.
Never pay above blue book.
Once you examine the motorcycle in person, take note of any discrepancies or damage. If anything doesn't look right, walk away. When dealing directly with a private seller, don't be afraid to haggle over the price. It never hurts to ask.
Always be prepared to pay immediately and in full for a used motorcycle. Make sure you pick it up immediately after the sale and get a signed receipt, signed off title, signed bill of sale, statement of accurate mileage, keys, manual and any spare parts or accessories if they have those.

, Search on-line consumer websites like Yelp or Google for consumer ratings and ask questions.
Don't be afraid to visit two or more dealers selling the same product.
Question the total amount, including destination charges and assembly charges. Ask to have those waived or reduced.
With very few exceptions, it's usually best to avoid optional aftermarket warranty coverage for a new motorcycle. Dealers make a considerable profit on those policies. If you want one, you can often buy them yourself after the sale from various competing companies on line.
Do not get into a discussion with the dealer as to how much you can afford each month. Settle the final out-the-door price of the motorcycle first, then discuss financing terms afterwards. Always read the contract very carefully before signing anything, especially the purchase agreement.
Do not believe a dealer who tells you that you must have the dealer service your motorcycle in order for the warranty to remain valid. The law states that you have the right to work on your own vehicle or take it to someone else if you wish without voiding the warranty.

, The best method of payment is usually cash in full, as it eliminates a large set of variables from the purchasing process, however with a large purchase, financing is often used. Here's a guide:


Put as much down as possible to reduce the term and payment.
Do not extend the term beyond 5 years. In many cases, the motorcycle with depreciate enough within the first 2 years where you may find the loan upside down. By choosing a shorter term, you minimize this risk.
Do not agree to a payment that will not fit your monthly budget.
Make sure the interest rate is clearly stated and that it is not variable.
Make sure the payment amount is exactly what the dealer quoted you.
If possible, secure financing through your own bank or credit union prior to negotiating the sale. Credit unions often will offer low rates on vehicle financing.
Always get signed copies of any paperwork and keep these for as long as you own the vehicle.

,


Get insurance. Motorcycle insurance for most riders is actually very affordable and there is no reason to delay.
Register the motorcycle right away in your name. Your local motor vehicle department will check the VIN to see if there is any problem.
Pay the correct taxes for the motorcycle. Do not try to falsify information about the sale amount.
If you're a new rider, take a motorcycle safety course, do not carry passengers and be very, very careful.

Fill out a preliminary application.,
Gather the necessary finances.,
Settle on a location.,
Sign your contract.,
Hire employees.,
Get your business license.",How to Become a Motorcycle Dealer2," To open a franchise of a major brand such as Harley-Davidson or Indian Motorcycles, start by visiting their website and submitting their application. This prospective application gets you in contact with one of their representatives who will discuss your qualifications.


Anyone buying an existing dealership also has to fill out this prospective dealer application.

, Franchise dealerships have a minimum amount of financial capital required in order to ensure standard business practices that will make you successful as a dealer and protect the brand’s image. Money for internal operating expenses such as parts, uniforms, and management systems have to be considered, but so do expenses such as facility and labor costs. This money is gotten through bank loans, acquaintances, and investors.


A loan or credit line from a bank is your most available source of funding. They will check your credit, your cash flow, and your business plan before they loan you money.Investors can help, but it is tough to find them. Talk to people online or offline who share your passion and will go into business with you or pitch your franchise to someone who believes in your business plan.
Polaris for example as of 2017 requires about $150,000 to $200,000 in a minimum investment not including facility costs, but also requires a $500,000 credit line., Running a franchise requires a lot of space. Brands such as Yamaha require big, visible buildings. You will need to find a place that is retail-friendly and receives a lot of foot traffic. The building will have the brand name displayed prominently on the outside while offering enough space for your business operations and a showroom.Yamaha for example asks for 10,000 square feet of space for unit display, 750 for accessories, 750 for parts, and 1,000 for a service department., After you have spoken to the dealer representatives and sellers, if you are buying an existing franchise, your information may be verified and approved. Once it is, you can get your business license from the government and sign the contract., A small motorcycle shop can operate with the owner alone and possibly family and friends, but a big dealership is going to need a large quantity of people to perform varying roles, such as sales and operations. Interview for employees with good work ethic and motorcycle knowledge, then work on documentation.Employee insurance may be necessary for obtaining your business license, but you may also need to report your hirings and verify them for tax purposes.

, Consult with your local government officials to find out what documentation you need to submit. The state will need information about your business, such as how much product you sell, your property ownership or lease information, sales tax ID, worker’s compensation insurance, and so on.


In New York, for example, once your application is processed, you have to schedule an inspection of your facility and keep a sign showing your business as a dealership."
"
Find a small location to open shop.,
Calculate your business costs.,
Gather funding.,
Obtain proper licensing.,
Build your inventory.",How to Become a Motorcycle Dealer3," For a business that repairs motorcycles, sells used ones, or stocks new ones without a franchise, you don’t need as vast an amount of space as a brand dealership. Find a place that suits your needs. This will often be a small but visible storefront with garage space to work on motorcycles.


Vehicles left outside suffer environmental damage over time, so find a place where you can limit exposure as much as possible.

, $10,000 to $50,000 is often enough to get the business up and running, but you’ll need to factor in additional expenses such as advertising, shipping, employees, and specialized tools. They add up, so you’ll have to figure out how to keep your business profitable in the long run.Keep enough savings to last you for a year. It can take some time for the business to become profitable.

, Small shops need less funding than dealerships to start, so it may be possible to get much of the financing from friends and family. However, many potential small business owners will need to secure loans from the bank or venture capitalists. Search out small business loans, equity financing, or convince someone that your idea is solid and you have the experience with motorcycles and business to make your business a success.


Debt financing can be a good idea if you have good credit. You pay a monthly fee without sharing ownership of your business with the bank.
By conversing with people online or offline, there is a chance you’ll encounter someone who believes in your business plan or will go into business with you, sharing your expenses.

, Speak to your local government in order to find out what kind of license you need to sell motorcycles. This can be a lengthy process and involves proper documentation and background checks to see if your business practice is ethical. You will have to pay fees for the application and any dealer license plates then wait months for the application to be approved.


In California, for instance, you need to complete a training program and pass a test in addition to business documentation and local licensing., Now that your business is set up, you need to stock it with product. Franchise dealerships have the benefit of displaying the official brand, but as an unaffiliated dealer it’s up to you how to fill your store. Use your motorcycle and customer knowledge to combine a range of products with what the customers want.


You can buy used bikes or fix up old bikes from people around the community.
To carry new bikes, buy them individually or contact brand headquarters by finding their phone number or e-mail. Look through their catalogue, then ask them how you can place an order.
Consider ordering motorcycle parts and accessories as well. Be sure to mark the price up enough to make you profit.

Connect the negative LED strip wires to the negative battery terminal.",How to Install LED Lights on a Motorcycle," In addition to the LED light kit, you’ll need additional electrical wire, preferably in two different colors to help you differentiate the positive and negative battery connections. The job will also require velcro strips (or a permanent adhesive if you prefer), additional 18- or 20-gauge electrical wire, sandpaper, pliers, screwdrivers, soldering equipment (or soldering gel), wire terminal connectors, electrical tape, and an in-line fuse.;
, Test the strip by attaching the positive lead wire to the positive terminal on a battery and connecting the negative lead wire to the negative side of the battery terminal. Make sure that each individual strip fully lights.


Your LED kit may come with a battery you can use to test the LED strips. If not, you can use your motorcycle’s battery to test them. Just make sure you disconnect it from the motorcycle first. You can even use a spare nine-volt battery you have around to test the strips.As you’re testing the strips, separate all of the same-size strips into different piles. This will make it easier to use them later.
It’s a good idea to disconnect the motorcycle’s battery now even if you don’t need to use it to test the LED strips. In most models of motorcycle, you will find the battery located beneath the seat. By disconnecting the battery, you can test your LED light strips without worry of harming the other motorcycle components that it powers.

, Your specific LED kit may come with instructions for where to mount your lights, but if not, use painter’s tape to temporarily attach them to the motorcycle. Try a couple of designs and make sure that you have enough strips to complete the design you want.


Make sure you’re using masking tape since it won’t hurt the paint on your motorcycle at all when you peel it back off., Your LED kit will come with a switch, which should have three leads on the back—positive, negative, and ground. Pick a comfortable location where you will later mount the switch., Once you know exactly where all of your strips need to go, you can go about attaching them to the motorcycle. Many LED kits will come with tape strips already attached, but after sticking them, you’re pretty much stuck with the design. Using thin velcro strips instead can give you plenty of adhesion while also giving you the option to move them at will.If you’re certain you won’t ever want to move the strips, you can naturally use the tape strips that come with them or pick up some strong double-sided tape to use to adhere the strips.

, With your positioning picked out and your velcro applied, you can now adhere the strips to your motorcycle. For some spots, such as placing a strip on the underside of a fairing, you might have to remove pieces. These aerodynamic pieces are simply held in place with mounting screws, so you can remove them with a screwdriver and/or socket wrench.When positioning your strip, make sure that you velcro it with the wiring pointing toward the battery. You’ll need to feed all of the wires in this general direction.

, Some wiring, such as that behind a fairing, might need to be fished out for you to take care of the electrical portion of the project. You can use rigid line like that from a weed eater or even fishing line. Tie the wiring to the line, then once the fairing is back in place, you can fish it out with the fishing line., Using some additional red (since it’s the positive terminal) electrical wiring, you will need to attach your switch to the positive battery terminal. Solder a ring terminal to one end of the wire. This end will fit over the positive terminal on the battery before you tighten it down. Solder another terminal to the opposite end after you’ve run enough wire to reach the switch.


You should additionally splice your in-line fuse into this portion of the wiring. LEDs draw very little power, but connecting a fuse is always the safe thing to do. The in-line fuse will have a wire coming out of each side. Cut a gap in your wire in a spot where the fuse can fir easily near the battery under your seat. Use your wire strippers to remove maybe 1/2” of the wire sheath and twist together your wire and those from one end of the fuse, then use electrical tape to secure the connection. Do this on both sides, so the fuse runs seamlessly. You will only need a 5-10 amp fuse since the lights draw so little power.If you’re unsure how, you can look up how to Solder, or you can purchase a soldering gel, which allows you to place the wire into the terminal along with the gel, then simply add heat.
Your switch will most likely have male terminal connections, so you’ll need a female terminal connections to solder to the wire.For any wire splices that you make sure the project, you can additionally buy heat-shrinking wire wrap to further secure the spliced connection. The wrap slides over the wire on top of the electrical tape (make sure you buy the appropriate size for the wire you’re using), and then you can apply a bit of heat with a lighter (don’t burn the wire to either side of the wrap), which will cause it to shrink down and reinforce the splice., This connection also requires an additional piece of wire with a connection to the switch soldered at one end and a ring terminal soldered at the other. You will connect one end to the ground terminal of your switch, and you will connect the other end to the metal frame of your motorcycle. The ground wire needs to have a metal-on-metal connection, so it’s easiest simply to find a metal portion of the frame with a bolt near the switch location and to put the ring terminal over the bolt and tighten it back down.In order to ensure that it’s a metal-on-metal connection, use a piece of sandpaper to remove any paint that might be on the frame directly where the bolt tightens down to the frame., Run the positive wire from each of your LED strips toward where you have placed your switch. Run the wires tight to the frame, securing them if you need to. Once all of the wires have enough length to reach your switch, use your wire strippers to remove a bit of the wire sheath, twist them all together, and solder them to the terminal you need to connect them to the positive terminal on the switch.If the positive and negative wire sheaths on your LED strips are connected, you can use an X-Acto knife or box cutter in the divot that runs parallel to the two wires to separate them since you will need to run them in opposite directions.
If any of the wires end up being too short, you can use some of the additional wiring you have to make it longer. Just use the wire strippers to remove a bit of the end sheaths, twist each bunch together, and secure it well with electrical tape.

, Now run all of the negative wiring from your LED strips to the battery. Like you did with the line from the battery to the switch, you’re going to connect them to the battery with a ring terminal. Once you’ve run all of the negative wires from each LED strip to the battery, solder them into the ring terminal that you will attach over the negative terminal of the battery before tightening it down.

Pick your installation pathway for the pin striping or reflective tape first, then mark this path.,
Attach the first 1"" to the front of the car, usually the fender.,
After completing the first half of the car, repeat this same procedure from the ending point to the rear of the car exactly.

,
Tackle all openings such as the hinge and latch side of the door.,
Tap your finger lightly all along the pinstriping or reflective tape to insure it is sticking, then you can lightly wipe it down with your finger using a light pressure.",How to Install Pinstriping or Reflective Tape on Your Car or Motorcycle," If it will be a straight line, you can tape a guide string to the front and rear of the car, pulling slightly on the string to make it straight. This will be your guideline.;
, Pull off the backing and slightly stretch the tape and extend it to approximately 1/2 the distance on your car. As you slightly tug on the pinstriping, you can make the line perfectly straight. Once you have the position you want, begin to lower the pinstriping to your car body and it will attach itself lightly as you lower it to the car body.


If using reflective tape, after attaching the first 1"", spray the car down with a solution of 6 drops of dishwashing liquid to 1 cup of water. Spray this solution on the car to prevent tacking of the reflective tape, otherwise it will stick and break if you should need to pull it up and try again.

,, Simply take a straight edge and cut the pinstripe or reflective tape in the middle, then wrap the excess around the door towards the inside of the vehicle.

, After several passes along the entire path with your finger, you can push progressively harder on the pinstriping or reflective tape.

Purchase an LED accent light kit.,
Place the lights where you want them on the bike.,
Make a junction for the lights to connect together.,
Connect the junctions together.,
Connect to the power source.,
Button up.",How to Install LED Accent Lights on a Motorcycle," These kits can be found online or at a local motorcycle or ATV dealership.;
, Most of the lights come in the form of strips or pods with adhesive on the back of them. Place the lights on the bike any way you want but try to keep it symmetrical on either side of the bike to make the lights have an even effect when illuminated.

, To reduce the amount of wires running through your motorcycle it is necessary to make a junction. Take the wires running from the lights on the right side of the bike and run them all to one point. This point should be close to the seat because your battery is underneath it. Using a wire stripper remove about ½” of rubber insulator from the ends of each wire. Connect the positive wires from the lights by twisting the exposed wires together. Do the same for the negative wires. Repeat this step for the other side as well.

, Remove the seat according to instructions in your owner’s manual because the next step occurs under the seat. From one of the junctions you just made connect a wire to the positive and negative terminals by twisting the exposed wires together. Wrap this connection in electrical tape to secure it. Repeat this step for the other side and connect the two junctions together by twisting the positive wires together and the negative wires together.

, From this central junction connect another wire by twisting one side to the positive wire and the other side to the negative wire. Wrap these connections in electrical tape. You should now have one wire with positive and negative sides. Loosen the bolts on the positive and negative terminals of the battery. Place the positive wire between the positive terminal and the bolt head on that terminal and tighten it down to pinch the wire between the bolt and the terminal. Repeat this step with the negative wire and the negative terminal.

, Put the seat back on and make sure the electrical connections you made are solid and can’t move around. Turn the ignition on and step back and admire your work.

First disconnect the battery.,
Then just lift the front up and away from the Goldwing.,
Inside the trunk, remove the five screws holding the lock mechanism cover in place.,
Disconnect the two saddlebag cables from the mechanism.

,
Number plate and bracket off, then the five bolts holding the rear fender (all highlighted in green).

,
Unclip the fender.,
Repeat this on the other side of the trunk.,
Remove the three nuts holding the trunk lights in place and pull the lights out.,
Unclip any cable ties that you can see.,
These two pictures show the trunk tipped forward.,
Standing at the rear of the bike and looking at the trunk base, you can see the rubber grommet (right side) to be removed in the first picture.

,
Remove the other grommet on the left side as well.

,
Position the supplied cardboard template over the grommet hole as shown in the second picture, making sure that the highlighted side is flush with the edge of the lip as shown.

,
Then use an awl or punch to mark the spots where you will be drilling the 22mm holes.,
Now it's time to drill the 28mm hole in the base of the trunk for the players wire harness to pass through (left side hole).,
Time to fit the Hondaline player mounting brackets.,
With the trunk refitted, pop the Hondaline CD player and cage into place.,
The plastic cover for the unit has to slot in position as shown in the left picture.,
The highlighted connector in the rubber boot is where the Hondaline CD player plugs into, the other highlighted foam covered plug is the one coming from the CD player that plugs into it.",How to Fit Hondaline CD Player to GI1800 Goldwing (01 06)," Then it's off with the saddle. When you remove the Allen bolts, firmly push the riders backpad rearwards until the two white tabs at the front of the saddle clear the shelter bracket.;
, Check that the rubber spacers under the saddle (where the bolts go through) are still in place. Tip; Use plenty of soft cloths to cover any panels that are even remotely at risk from falling bolts, screwdrivers etc. GL1800 plastics are even more expensive than those for older Goldwing models.

, Note that the bottom two are fine threads and shouldn't be mixed up with the self tappers, unless you really like ruining Goldwing parts.

,,, Tip; The middle bolt is different to the other ones, don't mix them up.


The trunk mouldings and lower cover have to be removed as well. First picture shows the side trim screws to be removed (highlighted), the two screws under them are for the lower cover and should be removed as well.

, Pull the side trims off. Second picture shows the screws to be removed for the long trim to be unclipped.


Third picture shows the remaining screws that hold the lower cover in place. Slide the cover (carefully) towards the rear of the bike and free of the trunk & saddlebag levers.

, Disconnect the bulb holders and pull the wires down through the holes in the trunk.


Second picture shows the large connector block to disconnect and picture three shows the other connectors to be unhooked. You can see where the Electrical Connections accessory (fitted between the blue connector block) that allows the trunk brake light to act as a running light as well.







, At this point, if you have the Hondaline passenger audio controller fitted, you should remove the trunk pockets by taking out the three screws inside the trunk, right behind each pocket.


Last picture shows two of the trunk mounting bolts removed, the other two are just at the rear and out of view in this picture. Don't forget to pull out the helmet holder knobs, they usually pop out easily enough. Take a good look and note how the wires are routed so you don't get it wrong at reassembly time.







, Our lunchtime football came in handy and kept the trunk from going too far forward onto the Goldwings frame.

,,,, Repeat on the left side. Then drill the holes. Don't forget to put the grommets back.

, I've also drilled the hole on the right side as I was fitting the Hondaline CB radio at the same time as the Hondaline CD player. Honda have the positions of the holes marked precisely. Tip; If you are fitting the old type mounts, you don't need to remove the trunk to drill the hole. With the saddle removed, you can get a 28mm holesaw and heat it with a butane torch and just melt the hole in the trunk.

, First picture shows the left side bracket sitting loosely and below that you can just see the cardboard F template sitting astride the frame member.


Second picture is the view from the inside and you can see better where the bracket must touch the template. Make sure the bracket is fitted the right way around as shown, otherwise it won't fit through the 22mm holes you drilled earlier. Fit the clamp to the bottom of the bracket and bolt it in position. Repeat for the bracket on the right side.







, The CD unit is easy to screw into the cage so no need for pictures of that. Use the big chromed Allen bolts (highlighted in green) to screw the cage onto the visible mounting brackets (now you know why you had to drill the four 22mm holes) that you fitted earlier. The two small brass-coloured self tappers just behind the front chrome bolts will need to be removed and binned for the unit to open. Put a small dab of grease on the spring clip each side and on the two holes (highlighted in red) for the cover to slide along. You can see the CB radio that I was fitting as well. The wire harness for the CD player harness goes through the hole you drilled.

, Once it's in place you can close the unit and fit the large chrome Allen bolts. Job done.


Tip: Before you bolt the cover down, make sure that the hinged flap (where it meets the trunk) is turned upwards as shown in the second picture, rather than down, or it will most certainly break off in record time.







, When you've connected everything up, test the operation of the CD player before refitting the saddle to the Goldwing.

Check to see if your helmet has good winter features.,
Consider getting a better, padded helmet.,
Get a pinlock visor for your helmet.,
Consider a balaclava.,
Buy a suitable jacket.,
Check out some thermals.,
Consider over trousers.,
Decide whether to winter glove or to not winter glove.,
Find boots that don't leak.,
Buy a power bank.,
Consider heated clothing.",How to Dress for Winter Motorbike Riding," Look online to find if your helmet visor can be replaced for one that has pin lock. Pin lock is two pins on a visor and an insert that clips in. If you buy an insert from a shop they will often fit it for you. The insert prevents the visor fogging up. Helmets with more padding and removable liners are warmer and will last longer.


Check that the helmet fits well. Spend plenty of time trying on different helmets as different brands size up different. It might sound silly be even the way your hair is styled can affect your helmet's fit.;
, Some cheaper helmets lack on padding meaning, they have too many gaps for wind flow. Whilst Arai and Shoei are nice. They are expensive and other brands do a similar job. For example, Airmada. Find a store that sells big helmets and try on different helmets. Different helmet brands come up different sizes. As an example, someone could be an XL in a Shoei but in a Caberg, they could be an XXL. Try on all the helmets you can. Don't rush. If you intend to keep the helmet for some time, then removable pads are a serious consideration., If they don't have a pinlock visor, consider getting a new helmet. A pin lock visor is a visor with two plastic pins. Then, you buy a insert that goes between the pins. A motorbike shop will often fit for you. The insert can last a long time and will cost £20 to replace. Once installed properly, it is impossible to fog your visor at all even held over steam. In the winter, a pinlock visor keeps your visor clear and you don't have to open the visor to clear it. Nearly, all pinlock visors do not come with an insert, so check to make sure., Whilst not everyone likes them, a good balaclava will retain heat and block the cold. Knox hot hood is thin but very warm water resistant and wind proof one that is worth a look. Some shops will let you try them on and if so be sure to try it with your helmet on.

, Price is not the main point on a waterproof jacket as even expensive ones can leak. A jacket gloves and trousers are the three important elements so do your research. Look for one with a removable winter liner and vent zips. This will make a jacket an all year jacket and will save you buying two jackets. Many jackets get heavy when wet no matter the price. Exceptions are pro layer Gore-Tex which are bonded on the outside however they can be expensive but work great.


When it comes to brand Google the specific model your looking at and check all the reviews. Not all jackets are waterproof even the ones that claim they are. Take a phone with you to the store to read reviews as good stores carry lots of items. Deciding a budget in advance will help you narrow the field. Make sure you can move comfortably in your jacket. Don't put looks before safety either.

, Thermals add an important layer and retain much more heat than say a jumper plus they are a lot thinner and are a must for cold riding. Any thermals will make a massive difference to the cold; price may not be a factor.

, If you wear proper motorbike trousers you will find many leak straight away or over time. A top layer is a fraction of the cost and protects the expensive gear underneath. That said even a lot of over trousers leak ones to avoid are cheap walking ones. Flexothane trousers are very waterproof and also come as dungarees.


Get waterproof trousers. Don't get bike trousers or over trousers because they leak. Try Flexothane Classic Hivis Trousers (£15) and they will not leak for love. A good thing about those is that they are bright orange, great for being seen early winter mornings.

, Most gloves don't do it all. The best dry and warm option is muffs however they don’t look great but they will protect you no matter what. Another great option is lobster claw or mitts over gloves they are awesome warm and convert summer gloves into winter without spending a fortune and protect your gloves getting ruined in the winter. Most gloves get heavy when wet and take a long time to dry out. Look for gloves where the waterproof layer is bonded to the outside like knox and you will find they stay dry alot better.

, Various boots regardless of the cost still end up leaking. You need to check lots of reviews to find ones that don't. Again don't trust that they say they are waterproof. Dunlop riggers work well and are very cheap. Test your boots in a bath as some can be faulty.

, Whilst it is not clothing it is a super important item to carry in the winter and pretty useful most of the year. Winter weather is often nasty cold and sometimes dark and your phone is always charged right up till the moment you breakdown then its completely dead just when you need it the most.


Whichever one you buy take it to the pound store and buy a click lid food container and usb lead if req. Put sponge in any leftover gap to pad it out. Charge it up chuck it in the box and put it under your seat or back box and forget about it. The other option which is better but more bulky is a wind up charger type as it can never go flat but again protect it in something to stop it getting wrecked

, Riding around in your own personal, portable electric blanket certainly takes the chill out of winter riding. Research these products carefully and get advice to make sure anything you're considering will suit all your needs. Some small bikes may have an issue running heated items including grips so check first before you consider it.


Cutting into electrics should not be considered unless you know what you're doing. if in doubt pay for it to be fitted. Heated gear can be expensive but will deal with extreme weather. That said the above steps should cover you through the worst if your cold after that it means its snowing and you should consider leaving the bike at home

Immediately remove the boots or bags and wipe them down before starting.,
Air-dry the items.,
Waterproof the items.",How to Care for Motorcycle Boots and Saddlebags,";
, Drying should be done with little or no heat and enough air circulation to dry them completely from soaked in 2 days. If the boots are only half soaked, it should be OK to dry them in one day. Obviously, someone who soaks a pair every day must rotate two or three pair of boots. This is critical for your feet as well as for the boots. In cold climates where cold feet can be life threatening, it is important to avoid soaked boots whenever possible. Even if boots contain Gore-Tex® Liners, they must be kept dry or your feet will feel wet and cold.

, There are several types of products to make boots or bags water repellent and a few that claim to make them waterproof. Some boots have waterproof liners and factory treatments, but even these require maintenance. Consider several types of water-proofers but often the choice is limited by compatibility with what the factory has applied. Silicone treated leather easily accepts more silicone, etc.


Before waterproofing or water repellent is applied, the boot should be clean and dry. Heavy dirt should be scrubbed off with a wet brush. Light deposits can be wiped away with a cloth moistened in water or solvent. Solvent has the advantage of evaporating quickly so you don’t have to wait before applying waterproofing. The oldest way to protect and preserve leather is by applying something incompatible with water to fill the pores, fibers, and spaces in the leather. The ancient Egyptians used Beeswax if they could get it, and even today, it is a premium product. Other fill materials are Goose Grease, Bear Grease, Mink Oil, Neatsfoot Oil (from boiling hooves), Lanolin, Petrolatum (petroleum jelly), silicone oil, mineral oil, or pitch and pine tar. They simply aim to occupy all space in the surface of the leather so that water cannot enter.

Most of these are fluid at room temperature. You apply them to the outer surface but they soon soak in. You must frequently reapply them to maintain the waterproof quality. After a few applications, the liquid has soaked through the leather. Now it fills all the spaces through the entire thickness of the leather, and begins to show up on your socks. The leather gets soft and mushy and can no longer absorb perspiration to keep your feet comfortable.


The alternative is to choose a product that is solid after application. Quality waxes with solvent to aid in application and little or no oil are ideal because they remain fixed in the surface of the leather.

Beeswax provides the maximum waterproof quality and durability for smooth full-grain (top of the skin) leather footwear. Oil or chrome tanned leather accepts wax readily after removal of any factory coating. (Glycerin and Carnauba wax, which are both water-soluble, often are applied for temporary shine and scuff resistance). To remove these temporary coatings a new boot should be washed with a soft brush using residue free detergent or a mild liquid dish washing soap, and allowed to dry completely before applying waterproofing.
Beeswax products also protect split, sanded, suede, rough, and recycled leather. These materials need the protection of wax for rugged use, but it will change their appearance. As wax coats the exposed fibers and fills surface gaps, these non-top grain materials become darker and slicker. Needless to say grease, oil, animal fat, and pine pitch products will not be used where appearance or odor is important.
Gore-Tex® fabric lined boots should be protected the same as you would treat them if Gore-Tex® was not present. Beeswax does not affect Gore-Tex® and Gore-Tex® does nothing to protect the outer boot from water and other abuse. To benefit from the breath-ability of the Gore-Tex® liners, the inside of the leather must be dry and free of oil, grease, or animal fat so that it can absorb perspiration from the foot. At night, this moisture will evaporate through the Gore-Tex ® and pass out of the boot leaving it dry and comfortable for the next day’s use. The Gore-Tex® liner will hold water away from your foot, but the wax will keep your boot warmer and lighter by preventing water from being absorbed by the outer layer of the boot or leaking into the space between the leather and the liner. When the leather is wet it can add 1½ pounds to a boot.
Beeswax gets results from the combination of its ability to remain fixed in the outer layer of the leather and the superior water resistance of Beeswax. Beeswax has a melt point of about 146 degrees Fahrenheit. It is very dry and oil free. Thus once applied it is not only waterproof but also extremely durable. Beeswax provides just enough lubrication to prevent hardening of leather in typical use. It does not soften leather, try Obenauf's leather oil for dry leather.


Grease, oil, animal fat, and many wax formulas are liquid (or at least soft enough to migrate through leather) at wearing and storage temperatures. They should be avoided because they soak away from the surface and migrate through the leather. They require frequent re-applications to maintain effective concentration on the surface. After a time the heel counters and box toes soften. The leather becomes soft and spongy then the product begins to appear on your socks indicating it has soaked all through the leather. Animal fats become rancid, decaying leather and promoting fungal growth until one day the leather is so rotten the eyelets pull out when you lace up your boots. Saturated leather cannot absorb perspiration and loses its insulation value so your foot feels clammy and cold.
Silicones offer easy application but less water resistance, durability, and protection than Solid Wax. Silicones resist water two different ways. The first is similar to wax, oil, animal fat, and grease: it simply occupies space in the leather so that water can’t occupy the same space. The second method is by reducing surface tension so that water beads up and does not ""wet"" it. This is similar to the function of Fluoropolymers but Fluoropolymers - when successful - reduce surface tension further so that even oil and some solvents can’t ""wet"" it. (This is why fluoropolymer is superior for stain resistance.)

Silicones are usually in solvent systems for water repellent products because water systems (aqueous emulsions of silicone) can’t match the performance of the solvent systems. A variety of solvents will work but there are advantages and disadvantages with each. The non-flammable solvents are bad for the environment. Even the flammable solvents are VOCs but some are more harmful than others are. There is also a wide range of flammability. Mineral spirits dries slowly but is much less dangerous than solvents that dry more quickly. Even the aerosol propellant can make a difference. C02 is non flammable and a few grams will empty a can. Propane Isobutane is extremely flammable and, because it is heavy and cheap, may be used to fill half the can with no value to the consumer. Polymerizing silicones actually form a film that resists washing away much better that simple silicone oils. For heavy-duty applications where repellent effectiveness is more important than appearance, choose a product that is at least 10% silicone by weight. A heavy-duty silicone formula is an excellent choice for split, or sanded leather or leather / fabric, especially if the suede appearance is more important than a long lasting waterproof from wax.


Fluoropolymers are designed and intended for use on textiles for stain protection. They require an absolutely clean surface for adherence and 300 °F (149 °C) heat is used at the mill to orient the molecules for maximum effectiveness. Applied under perfect conditions they work well and last for many washings if washed only in residue-free detergent.

Fluoropolymers are generally superior to silicone for oil and stain repellency but generally, inferior to silicones, waxes, and fill products for water repellency. Factory applied Fluoropolymer treatments on textiles can be restored to full effectiveness by washing with residue-free detergent to remove residue and then Ironing on Steam setting.
Fluoropolymers can give inconsistent results depending greatly upon what surface they are applied to. Baking at 300 °F (149 °C) as in textile mill applications is impossible for boots and it is also difficult to keep boots clean enough for maximum repellency. In any case, Fluoropolymers are better left for clothing applications or limited to suede shoes where stain resistance is more important than Heavy Duty waterproofing.


There are some crossover products that use technologies such as aqueous wax or wax fortified with polymer. Some of these can be applied to wet leather. This sounds enticing when you have failed to prepare your boots beforehand and they are now soaking wet. However, you still must dry them after application before they are ready to keep you warm and dry. Unfortunately, emulsified waxes (with or without polymers) are about as ineffective as emulsified silicones. When wax, oil, or silicone is emulsified, a surfactant has been used to make it mix with water. The surfactant residue defeats the repellent by enabling water to mix with it. This quickly defeats the purpose of excluding water.
There are many choices for the casual user. A quick dash from the car to the door isn’t likely to test any appropriately applied product. But when you need serious waterproofing nothing is as effective or long lasting as Beeswax.

Understand what the requirements are for repairing motorcycles.,
Begin your motorbike repair training with a high school diploma.,
Research motorcycle repair training programs and workshops in your area.,
Get certified in motorcycle mechanics.,
Opt for an internship at a dealership.,
Consider getting a job in a dealership as an assistant mechanic.,
Stay abreast of the latest in the field of motorcycle repair.",How to Get Motorcycle Repair Training," Before getting the training, you need to make sure that you know what you are getting into. Motorcycle mechanics need to know how to repair, maintain, adjust and test all the components of a motorcycle. They should be knowledgeable in the complete mechanics of a motorcycle and be able to recognize and fix mechanical problems.;
, Even though this is not a requirement, a high school diploma is a helpful foundation to build upon. Any mechanical training will be easier to comprehend once you have completed classes in basic English, math and science.

, Not only do colleges offer mechanical training for motorcycle repair, but some dealerships do also. Look in trade magazines for information or search online. Ideally you should opt for training that covers different model bikes, unless you prefer to specialize in 1 particular model.

, This may be a requirement in the area that you want to eventually work in. Find out what the exact requirements are, and complete the certification as soon as you can after completion of your training.

, Experience is a great way to train. When you work in the actual environment you hope to eventually have a career in, you will gain valuable knowledge. Internships provide you with real life, day to day, situations that you probably won't experience in a classroom. You could set yourself up with an internship while you are taking classes. This way you can practice what you learn in the classroom, out in the field.

, You can start off doing odd jobs or running around for the head mechanic. Once you have your foot in the door, you can work your way up as you prove your competence as a mechanic. If you become a valued employee, you can ask your employer if there are any motorcycle repair courses in place that you can attend. Your employer may be willing to pay for you to get further training in the field.

, This may mean continued training so that you are familiar with recent trends as technology changes. By doing this, you are improving your chances for advancement in your company. Additionally, you will increase your value within your company, making you less likely to be laid off or replaced.

Understand first and foremost that one of the most important features of a good motorcycle helmet is to provide you with adequate protection if you are injured.,
Examine the motorcycle helmet that you are considering purchasing very closely.,
Measure the dimensions of your head so that you will get a properly fitting motorcycle helmet.,
Visit several retail stores that sell motorcycle helmets.",How to Buy a Motorcycle Helmet," Motorcycle helmets will protect your head and neck region in the event of an accident while on the open road and will substantially lower your chances of sustaining permanent or long-term damage.


While you are shopping for a motorcycle helmet, choose a model that meets minimum safety requirements. As an example, within the United States, the Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) maintains safety requirement levels and standards for motorcycle helmets. Models that meet D.O.T. standards have been tested for compliance and will provide you with a higher level of protection.
Look for a sticker attached to the motorcycle helmet that you are considering purchasing for notification of meeting recognized safety standards. Additional examples of recognized private, non-profit organizations that maintain safety standards for motorcycle helmets are Snell and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).;
, As an example, a good helmet will weigh several pounds according to D.O.T. standards and have a thick, protective inner, impact-absorbing liner.


Look at the chin strap, also referred to as the retention system. A quality motorcycle helmet that is designed properly will stay on your head in the event of an accident to protect you from injuries. A good fit is important as you should not be able to pull the helmet off when it is securely strapped.

, Wrap a tape measure around the largest circumference of your head, the location of which is generally in the region above your eyebrows. Depending on the manufacturer and what country you reside in, available size choices may range in the area of small, medium, large or extra large.

, Consider standards for protection against impact, penetration, retention and peripheral vision when you shop for a motorcycle helmet.


Try on several helmets so that you find one that provides a good, secure fit and provides ample viewing through the face shield. When wearing a motorcycle helmet, you should have a minimum visibility of 105 degrees to each side so that you have clear vision on your right side as well as your left side in addition to the center front area while riding.
Look for safety standard stickers on the motorcycle helmets that tell you that they have met safety requirements set forth by a recognized organization or agency. Choose quality safety features even if it entails paying a little more for your purchase. Your safety and life do not have a price tag.

In some events, the bearings may fall out while still in the oven. For that reason, it is good to put a baking sheet under the casing, to prevent things from falling on the oven element. If you are using a torch, heat up the area around the bearing for 1-2 minutes , moving the torch always and not allowing the flame to touch anything . May take several 1-2 minutes sessions .

, Examine the casing to see which direction the bearings must go in order to be removed. In most cases, bearings can only be removed from one direction, so you must press it out from the other direction. In some cases, you may only be able to access the bearing from one direction and must pull the bearing out with limited clearance. That is little to no fun at all. Bearing pullers are available at discount tool suppliers such as Harbor Freight . Seldom needed but a worthy $25 investment .



For bearings that can be pushed out, take a socket or bearing driver of roughly the same diameter as the exposed outer ring of the bearing. Place it on top of the bearing from the back side of the casing (The side the casing cannot be removed from) and strike the socket with a dead blow hammer. A ball peen hammer can be used , but make sure you ease into the blows and the case is not laying on a heard surface like concrete . Wood is best . This should remove the bearing. Make sure the case is laying flat so the blow does not distort the case or crack it .

For bearings that must be pulled, make sure the casing is very hot, turn the casing over and strike the casing from behind with your dead blow hammer. If this fails to move the bearing, try taking an eye dropper of cool water and drip it onto the bearing. (Use an eye dropper as to not get cool water everywhere, which may crack a very hot casing.) and try again. If that fails, you may need a special extracting tool to remove the bearing.

, Because the replacements should be relatively cool,especially if you place them in the freezer for 30 minutes and handle with gloves or a paper towel , they should slide in much easier than the old bearings came out. A little WD-40 in the hole helps. Be sure to do this while the casings are still hot and its OK to reheat them .

, To accomplish this, you must insert the bearing in a way that prevents pressure from occurring on the inside ring of the bearing. A good way to accomplish this is to place your old bearing on top of your new bearing, then , using your dead blow hammer, strike the old bearing, which will somewhat evenly distribute the pressure on the new bearing.

, If you have a keen ear you will hear a change in the sound of the blows when the bearing seats fully .

, Absolutely no roughness is allowed . If any , start over with another bearing .

Listen to the engine idle.,

Spark plugs that have gone bad, however, will produce a rough, highly fluctuating idle. They can also cause engine misfires, which you should also listen for.;
,  Deteriorated spark plugs can cause incomplete combustion to occur in the engine, resulting in significantly reduced fuel economy.  Because there are many factors that affect fuel economy, potentially faulty spark plugs are often overlooked.

, A strong indicator of faulty plugs is if the bike feels as though it is struggling to pull itself along. While this may sounds subjective, it should be fairly obvious. If the throttle is not as responsive as you are accustomed to, the spark plugs could be at fault.

Grasp the bike by the left side of the handlebar and the rear tail handle
Stand the bike up straight and put up the side stand (kickstand) with your foot.
Put your bodyweight on the center-stand foot and rock the bike back onto the center-stand

, This is simple enough; just turn the ignition key in the keyhole on the left-side rear fairing to release the latch. Once the latch is released lift from the back of the seat, and the front of the seat will slide right out.

, While not necessary, this is a precautionary measure to keep you safe. Be sure to start with removing the negative (black) lead, then the positive (red) lead. Doing this out of order can result in sparks or even electrical shock. You will only need a Phillips head screwdriver to accomplish this task

, Suzuki suggests that you completely remove the upper fairings, which can be accomplished by first removing the lower fairings and side mirrors. However experience will show that removing the bolts indicated by the red arrows, and not completely removing the fairings will suffice. The two bolts on the opposite side of the motorcycle will also need removal - for a total of four bolts. A 4 mm Allen wrench is required.

, This involves several steps that need to be followed in careful order. The process is significantly easier if the tank comparatively empty. This step requires a 3/8 inch ratchet drive, a 10 mm socket, and potentially a set of pliers.


Remove the two 10mm tank mounting bolts indicated by the red double-sided arrow.
Disconnect the fuel gauge coupler. This is found on the right side of the bike and is indicated here by an orange circle. There is a small plastic lever that functions as a quick release when pressed. It should not require a lot of force to separate the coupler.
Turn the fuel valve (petcock) to on. On is the 6 o'clock position. The other two positions are reserve and prime, at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock respectively.
Lift the front of the tank.
Disconnect the fuel tank drain hose (1), vacuum hose (2), and fuel hose (3). Depending on your grip strength you may be able to remove the clamp (red arrow) on the fuel hose by hand, although pliers are recommended to simplify the process.The motorcycle in the image has been modified to not require the fuel drain hose, but the mount for it is indicated by the white (1).
Remove the tank. You may need to pull out slightly on the upper fairings to do this, if you chose to not completely remove them.

, This does not mean removing the rubber seals around the bore-holes. Rather these seals will be removed by disconnecting the mating surface between the spark plug and the cap, which is about 10 cm down in each bore-hole. They should readily separate from one another merely by vigorously wiggling them. Should that fail, their fairly robust design makes it is reasonable to pry them up with a flat head screwdriver or small pry bar.

, Any debris around the spark plugs will have direct access to the engine since the spark plugs are integrated into the cylinder head. Thus cleaning around them is very important to maintain your engines longevity.  This is typically accomplished with small bursts of compressed air. If you do not have access to a compressor, a small manual tool such as a toothbrush may be used instead.

, Use the spark plug wrench and T-handle from Suzuki, or a set of pliers. The pliers can be used to gain additional leverage to unseat the plugs, by gripping the top of the spark plug removal tool instead of the T-handle. Once unseated, the spark plugs can be unscrewed by hand. If you have access to a comprehensive tool set, a thin walled 18mm socket with an extension bar and ratchet drive is a more ideal instrumentation to accomplish this task.

, This step may be skipped if the decision to replace the spark plugs has already been made. If any of the following situations cannot be rectified, the plug needs to be replaced.


Check for carbon deposits. These will accumulate on the firing end of the spark plug. There are spark plug cleaning machines that can be used to rectify this. If this is not an option, the plugs may be carefully cleaned with a pointed metallic tool.
Verify the spark plug gap. This bike requires a gap of 0.6-0.7 mm (.024-.027in). This can be done using a thickness gauge or a set of dial or electronic calipers.
Observe the condition of the electrode. A burnt or worn electrode indicates the spark plug needs to be replaced
Check the exterior of the spark plug for cracks or damaged threads. These are not fixable problems.

, Only use a very small amount, and only apply it to the rubber. This improves the seal between the spark plug and the engine, preventing dirt or moisture from getting in.

, Tighten these by hand to ensure the threads in the cylinder head are not damaged.

, They should be tightened to 11 Newton meters (8 foot pounds).  The best tool for this job is a digital torque wrench like the one in the image instead of the spark plug wrench. Alternatively, tightening the plugs to finger tight and then using a tool to tighten them an additional ½ turn is widely accepted, although not endorsed by Suzuki.

, Everything goes back on in the opposite order relative to the sequence of taking the bike apart. Be sure to attach the spark plug caps to the proper cylinder. Each cap is numbered on the wire, which corresponds to the same number cylinder, numbered from left to right.

Tighten it with your hands about a quarter turn past the point of gasket-to-seat contact. Do not over-tighten unless you like using oil filter wrenches. Once the gasket seats the oil will not leak as the oil pressure in these bikes is not high. If you get a leak tighten a bit more, but only a little.

Congratulations!",How to Change the Oil and Oil Filter on a Motorcycle," This is one of the most important steps. You don't want to be running around looking for tools, containers and rags while oil is flowing out of your bike and your hands are too slick to turn a doorknob! Check the ""Things You'll Need"" section to get everything ready.;
, Put your drain pan approximately under the bolt. Try to think ahead of where the oil's going to shoot out, and watch it as it drains. You'll most likely have to adjust the placement of the drain pan as the old oil slows down. Use the proper tool to remove the bolt. You don't want to strip it! If it drops in the pan, just pick it up quickly and don't burn yourself if it's hot!

, Carefully unscrew the filter with a filter wrench or, in a pinch, wrap a leather (or rubber) belt around it like a dog choker to get it off. Be careful not to dent or damage the filter, as that could inadvertently allow some of the contaminants in the filter to go back into the engine. There may be some oil left in there that may splash out, so make sure you've got something under there to catch it. If it is on there really tight, you can punch a screwdriver through its side with a hammer and use that to get it loose.

, It may cost as much as a dollar, but is cheap insurance. Be sure to remove the old crush washer. The New Washer will help save the threads in your oil pan as it will take less torque to wrench down on the oil drain plug.If the drain plug washer is a copper washer it must be annealed to make it soft by heating to cherry red and cooling in water. All copper washers must be annealed before reinstalling or it will not compress. This includes new ones as copper hardens with age.

, Make sure it's clean of dirt and grime before putting it back. Remember that it's usually going into cast aluminum, so don't over-tighten it! Consult your manual or your local shop for torque specs for your bike. Remember when using a torque wrench that Nm is not equal to Ft-Lbs. If you don't torque in the bolt to spec, just install it snug but do not over-tighten it!

, ""Swish"" it around slowly to try to get all the filter material down in there wet with oil. Then, and this is very important, prep the rubber seal with a dab of oil on your finger. Just get the whole seal ""wet"". This will ensure that it makes good contact with the engine, and make it much easier to get it off during the next oil change.

, Carefully screw on the new filter. Don't force it! It should go quite easily. Once it takes more than about zero effort to turn it, it only needs about 3/4 of a turn left. You really don't want to over-tighten an oil filter. And you shouldn't need more than a clean hand to tighten it. Don't use a tool, unless it is attached to a torque wrench and you are tightening it to factory specs!

, Look in your manual for oil capacity and use the funnel to add about half a quart under full capacity into the fill hole. Stop and check the level. Add or drain oil as necessary to be at about the bottom third between Add and Full. You don't want to overfill the oil! It adds undue pressure on the seals in your engine and can lessen its life. Remember that on motorcycles you have to have it straight up and down, not on the side stand, to check the level.

, Most auto places that sell you the oil will take it back if you pour it back into the original containers. It's a messy job, but don't pour it on the ground. It doesn't go away, it's really bad for the environment, and quite likely it is illegal.

,, Job well done.

If you are not familiar with motorcycle parts, take your vehicle to a mechanic certified to work on your make and model. A mistake in a home repair could be fatal.



Caution! — Due to the vast number of makes and models of motorcycles, it is not possible to give instructions that match every case. This article should supplement your motorcycle owner's manual, not replace it.;
, There are usually two bolts holding the brake caliper onto the bike, requiring a size 8, 10, or 12mm socket wrench. The exact setup varies with the make and model.


If you're using a basic Allen key wrench instead of a socket, you might want to ""crack"" (loosen slightly) the other two bolts on the caliper, holding in the brake pads. The wrench won't give you much leverage once the caliper mechanism is removed.

, Most motorcycles have two bolts holding in the brake pads. These typically have an Allen key head. They are much easier to remove and install using an Allen key socket for more leverage. Once the bolts are loosened, the pads will either fall out or can be wiggled out by hand.


Some manufacturers use cotter keys or retaining pins to hold in the brake pads as well. Make note of these if present.
On most models, one of the two pads is shaped slightly differently to fit into the caliper next to the front forks. Look carefully, since the replacements will need to go in the exact shape and position.

, The pistons should be easily visible behind where the brake pads once were. Before you can install your new brake pads, you must push these pistons as far back into the caliper cylinder as possible. This will keep the pistons out of the way while you install the new pads, and insure that the new pads are flush with the caliper sides. On bikes 250cc or less, you may be able to push the pistons back by hand. For larger bikes, press them back with reverse pliers or a large blade flathead screwdriver.


If you accidentally open the master cylinder cap or otherwise introduce air into the brake lines, you will need to bleed the brake line (refer to your owner's manual). In most cases this is not necessary.

, Make sure the new pads are the exact shape and size of the old ones. If the two pads are different sizes (which is common), make sure you know which pad goes into which side of the caliper. Insert the pad, aligning the bolt holes carefully with the holes in the caliper. Insert the bolts and hand tighten for now.


On most motorcycles it is not possible to install the pads backwards as they will only fit into the calipers one way. It's still best to pay attention to the position of the old pads, just in case.

, Assuming the pads are flush with the caliper sides and aligned with the bolt holes, it's time to secure the caliper mechanism back onto the front brake rotor. Align the bolt holes on the caliper and the bracket or front forks (depending on model). Insert the bolts and tighten with a torque wrench. It is very important' to tighten to the exact specifications mentioned in your owner's manual. The wrong torque can cause the bolts to snap off or come loose on the road.

, Remember, your brake pad bolts were only hand tightened. Now that the caliper is secure, you have the leverage to finish tightening the Allen key bolts easily.


Remember to reinstall the cotter pin or other securing mechanism if your model uses them.

, Pushing the caliper pistons back caused the brake fluid to flow back into the master cylinder reservoir. The first squeeze of the lever will get all the way to the grip without resistance, as if there is no fluid. Pump several times until you feel the correct amount of resistance on the lever, and you can feel the brakes putting resistance on the front rotor. As a final test, spin the front tire by hand and confirm that you can stop it by squeezing the brake lever.



Never forget this step after a brake change. The brakes will not work until your push the brake fluid back down.
Do not ride your motorcycle if the lever feels looser than normal. Take it to a licensed mechanic.

, New brake pads need an adjustment period to work properly. For the next 250–350 miles, ride at slower speeds and allow plenty of extra stopping distance. This allows you to apply the brakes gradually, preventing brake failure or damage to the pads or rotor.

As a last resort, you can prop the bike up on a cinder block. Cover the cinder block with a rubber mat or thick cloth to prevent damage to the front forks, as they will rest directly on the block.


Ideally, ask an assistant to help steady the bike as you work.;
, Some models hold in the front axle nut with a cotter pin, two-tined fastener bent to keep the nut in place. If yours has one, bend the tines back with needle-nose pliers and pull it out.

, The size of the nut varies between models, but usually falls between 18 and 24mm. A set of metric sockets in this range should include the correct size.

, This will push the axle back through both front forks and the wheel assembly, until it no longer holds the wheel assembly in place.

, If your motorcycle has a speedometer or odometer cable on the front wheel, you may need to remove them before removing the wheel. These are usually seated on the opposite side as the disc brake rotor, and can be removed easily by hand.

, Carefully place the front wheel on a clear, hard surface, flat with the disc brakes facing down. This position will help keep the wheel stable when you apply pressure to the tire rim.


Do not place the wheel on dirt or grass. These can get inside the wheel assembly and prevent smooth axle bolt insertion.

, Unscrew the valve stem core (for inflating the tire) with a valve stem core removal tool. Let all the air out of the inner tube.

, Insert a tire iron or large, flathead screwdriver into the small crack between the rubber tire edge and the metal wheel rim. Wiggle the tool back and forth while applying downward pressure until the wide tip pushes in under the tire edge.


The longer the screwdriver, the more leverage you'll have. A 12–14 inch (30–36cm) handle is recommended.

, Once your tire iron or screwdriver is inserted, push down on the handle, toward the center of the wheel. This movement should force the edge of the tire to pop loose from the metal wheel edge. Keep the tool in place to hold this tire edge over the wheel rim.

, Move over a short distance and insert a second tire iron or screwdriver just as you did the first. Once you have popped the tire loose here, move the second tool around the entire edge of the tire, breaking it loose from the wheel. Once you reach the first tool again, the tire edge should be completely loose and above the metal wheel rim.

, Flip the entire wheel over, so the disc brake rotor is now facing up. You can remove this side by hand: just press down firmly with your palm on the tire edge and it will break free from the rim. Continue to press around the edge of the tire until it is completely loose. You do not need to pull this side above the rim.


Both sides of the tire must be completely loose in order to change the tube without damage. You should be able to move the tire freely around the wheel rim without turning the wheel.

, Now that the tire is loose, you'll need to remove the inner tube. The first step of this process is to remove one or more nuts holding the valve stem in place. These retaining nuts may be different sizes, so use a small, adjustable wrench or set of small open-ended wrenches.

, Once the nuts are removed, push the valve stem toward the inside of the wheel with your finger and thumb. This will allow free movement of the inner tube.

, Reach into the tire with your fingers to grab the inner tube. You should be able to pull it out relatively easily, if the tire was loosened properly.

, Align the tube on the outside of the tire, so the valve stem is in line with the valve stem hole in the wheel assembly. Carefully start to push the tube into the tire next to the valve stem. At the same time, push the valve stem back inside the wheel and in through the valve stem hole in the wheel.



Caution — Make sure the new inner tube is perfectly flat with no kinks, pinches, or twists. If it is not flat while inserted, the tube will not air up properly.

, Just add one of the valve stem nuts for now and screw it on four or five turns. There's no need to tighten it; the nut is only here to prevent the stem from falling back through the hole.

, Work your way clockwise around the tire inserting the inner tube inside the tire. Again, make sure the inner tube has no twists or kinks as you insert it.

, The tire (or its new replacement) must go entirely inside the metal rim again so it forms a tight seal when the tube is inflated. Pull back the edge of the tire with one of the tire irons or large flathead screwdrivers. Press down on the tire with your palms to force the edge down under the rim. Repeat around the edge of the tire on both sides.



Caution — Take care not to pierce the inner tube with your tool.
If you are installing a new tire, check the instructions to orient the treads correctly.

, Inflate the new tube slowly at first. Listen closely for a whistle or other unusual sound. If you hear it, stop and check the tube for pinches or kinks. If the tube sounds normal, continue to inflate and listen for a sharp pop. This pop tells you that the tire has formed an airtight bead (seal) around the rim. Now check your tube and tire instructions and inflate until you reach the suggested pressure.


If you do not hear a pop, stop inflating and check that the tube is flat and the tire is completely under the metal rim.

, Find a glass cleaning spray or fill a spray bottle with soapy water. Spray along the whole tire perimeter, where it forms a seal on the metal rim. If air bubbles consistently break and reform over one spot, you have an air leak. You must push the tire into place before you continue. If you see no significant air bubbles, move on to the next step.

, If you removed the speedometer or odometer cable assembly from the wheel, return it to its original location.

, Clean the axle to remove all old grease and debris, so you have nothing left but a nice sparkling clean axle bolt! Parts cleaner-degreaser usually works great. Once you have it clean, put a thick layer of axle grease on the entire length of the axle bolt. Take care not to grease the bolt threads or the head of the bolt.



WARNING — Do not get the grease anywhere near the brake assembly, or the brakes may become nonfunctional.

, Have an assistant hold the front wheel assembly in place between the two front forks. Insert the axle bolt back through one fork and the wheel. Align it with the far fork and lightly tap the bolt head with a hard rubber mallet until the axle is through the far fork.

, If you have a torque wrench, tighten to 58lbs. torque or the recommended torque shown in your owner’s manual. Take care that the holes in the nut align with the holes in the axle, so you can reinstall the cotter pin.



Caution — Always use a torque wrench to tighten this nut. Eyeballing the correct torque increases the risk that the nut works its way loose while you are riding.

, If your model uses a cotter pin (split pin), insert one into the axle nut and bolt. Pull out the two split sides of the cotter pin to lock it into place.


While not mandatory, replacing the cotter pin each time you remove the axle is a good idea. The cotter pin becomes a little weaker each time you remove and install it.

, The loose nut on the valve stem can now be removed and left off the bike. Most experienced riders do not use these nuts, as they reduce flexibility of the tube and make it more vulnerable to damage.

, A proper motorcycle tire change stand makes this job easier and reduces the risk of bike damage and personal injury. Place the stand on solid concrete, never dirt or grass.


If you're using a built-in center stand, place a large block under the motor just in case.

, If your model uses a cotter pin (split pin), remove it from the rear axle with needle-nose pliers. The cotter pin is a fastener attached to the axle nut and bolt, with two tines bent apart to keep the nut in place.

, The required socket size varies with the make and model, but typically falls between 18 and 27 mm.

, Identify the brakes with the help of the advice below or your owner's manual. Adjust them depending on the type of brake mechanism:


If your rear wheel has drum brakes, they are enclosed inside a container (""drum"") on the wheel. Find the nut attached to the adjustment bolt on the drum lever, then loosen and remove it. This will allow you to push the rear wheel slightly forward for the next step.
If your rear wheel has disc brakes, they are housed in a caliper mechanism. In most cases, the discs will slide out without a problem when you remove the wheel. Check your owner's manual if you think adjustment may be necessary.

, This nut is usually on the right hand side of the rear wheel, attached to a stationary rod. Remove this nut and set it aside until the end of this process.

, Now that the nut is off, you can push the rear wheel forward a short distance. Stop pushing when the chain or belt is hanging loose enough to remove easily. Lift the upper side of the chain or belt and pull slightly back and upward. It should now be clear of the sprocket or pulley; move it left to detach it completely.

, Tap the axle bolt with a rubber mallet to push the axle slightly inward, just to loosen its position in the rear frame. Ask an assistant to help you lift the tire out of the rear frame and hold it steady. Tap the axle bolt until it is flush with the frame on the right side. You should be able to use your hand to wiggle the bolt from the bolt head on the left side. Wiggle with a twisting back and forth motion while pulling towards you, until the axle bolt is removed.

, Place the wheel brake-side-down, on a flat, concrete floor or other clear surface. Do not place it on dirt, grass, or any surface that might dirty the greased area where the axle bolt slides in.

, Find the valve stem core (inflating valve) on the rear tire. Unscrew it with a valve stem core removal tool to let out all the air in the inner tube. Any air remaining in the inner tube will make be quite difficult to remove.

, Insert one long tire iron or flathead screwdriver into the small crease where the edge of the rubber tire meets the metal wheel rim. Once you've worked the wide tip into this gap, push the long handle back down toward the wheel center to pop the tire out above the metal rim. Leave this tool in place to hold it there while you use a second tool to work your way around the tire. Continue levering the tire out until this entire side is above the metal rim.

, Flip the entire wheel over — if your bike has disc brakes, they will now be face up. You should be able to loosen this side of the tire just by pressing down firmly on the tire edge with your palm. Work around the tire until it is completely loose.


Unlike the first side, this side of the tire does not need to be over the rim. As long as you can freely rotate the tire around the rim, you are ready to continue.

, Find the stem where you inflate the tire, and remove the nut or nuts holding it in place. You may need an adjustable wrench, or several small wrenches of different sizes.

, Grab the valve stem and push it back into the inside of the wheel. Make sure it won't catch onto anything as you remove the inner tube.

, Reach into the tire and grab hold of the inner tube. Pull it out of the tire.


If you are having trouble pulling it out, confirm that the tire is completely loose.

, Make sure the new tube is perfectly flat, with no kinks, pinches, or twists. Align the valve stem with the matching hole in the wheel assembly, then carefully push part of the inner tube into this area of the tire. At the same time, push the valve stem back inside the wheel and in through the valve stem hole.

, You only need one nut, rotated about five times, to make sure the stem does not fall out of the hole. Do not tighten this nut further.

, Work your way around the tire, inserting the inner tube until it is inside the tire. Take care to avoid kinks and twists during insertion.

, Press down on the tire with your palms while forcing the edge inside the rim with a tire iron or large flathead screwdriver. Repeat around the tire edge until it is completely under the wheel rim.


Take special care to avoid puncturing the inner tube as you do this!
If you are replacing this with a new tire, make sure the treads are pointing in the correct direction.

, Listen for a whistle or strange noise that could indicate a kink in the tube, and correct if necessary. If all is well, you will eventually hear a pop as the tire forms an airtight seal against the rim. Continue filling until you reach the pressure recommended by your tire/tube manufacturer.

, Spray soapy water or glass cleaner around the tire perimeter, along the metal rim. Look closely for air bubbles escaping from between the rim and tire. If the bubbles continue forming in the same spot, it is not airtight. Force the tire back under the rim and check for a puncture.

, This is your chance to get your axle bolt debris-free and well greased. Apply parts cleaner-degreaser, then a thick layer of axle grease once clean.


Do not grease the bolt threads or head — you do not want that to slip!

WARNING — Use an abundance of caution to keep the grease away from the brake assembly. Grease will make the brakes nonfunctional.

, The next few steps are a two-man job. Ask a friend to hold the rear wheel in place between the two rear forks. If you removed the brake assembly earlier, now's the time to reattach it. Just hand tighten the brake adjustment nut for now.

, Lift this up over the top edge of the sprocket or pulley, until at least three or four links of the chain are resting on the top. Slowly and gently rotate the rear wheel backward (as if it were in reverse). This should guide the chain or belt into position on the sprocket or pulley as it should be.

, Next, reinstall the axle nut onto the axle, but leave it loose enough to move the wheel backwards in order to tighten the chain or belt.

, Examine the bike frame very close to the hole the axle bolt slides through. Some models have hash marks or slash marks to guide the installation, so you can be sure the axle and rear wheel are installed at a perfect 90º angle to the rear frame. If there are no marks, use a tape measure to confirm the axle is exactly the same distance from the front of the rear frame on both the right and left sides.



WARNING — A misaligned axle will cause your rear wheel to wobble. This leads to loss of control or a detached chain or belt. NEVER continue until you are certain you have installed the axle perfectly.

, Refer to your owners’ manual for the exact amount of play or slack that should be present in the chain or belt. Reinstall the adjustment nut on the right side of the rear frame and adjust according to manual instructions.

, Tighten this nut to 60-63 lbs. torque or the recommended torque shown in your owner’s manual. Do not attempt to estimate the torque without a torque wrench, as a mistake can cause the axle to detach while riding!


If your bike uses a cotter pin (split pin) to fasten this nut, align the holes in the nut with the holes in the axle. After tightening, insert the cotter pin and bend its tines apart to fasten the nut in place. Using a new cotter pin each time is ideal due to loss of strength during removal.

, Return to the brake assembly nut that you tightened by hand, and tighten it properly with a wrench. Examine each item you handled one last time to confirm there are no loose nuts or missing pins, especially if your model had additional fasteners not mentioned in this guide.


The one exception is the valve stem nuts. These are best left off the bike, as they may cause more harm than good by reducing flexibility of the tube during high speed riding.

If using regular motorcycle batteries, the electrolyte cells should be topped up with distilled water.,
Keep your battery charged.",How to Care for Motorcycle Batteries," All motorcycle batteries should be checked at least once per month.;
, The terminals should be cleaned to prevent corrosion which can cause problems starting the bike.  Cleaning regularly prevents the buildup of dirt and sediments.

, Loose connectors can mean the bike will not start or it will start only intermittently. They should also be checked after minor accidents or spills.

, Regular maintenance also entails looking out for leaks or checking if they are wet. Sometimes water can get inside the casing and cause the metal connectors to rust. Leakage can indicate problems so it should be dealt with immediately. 

, The water level should be checked at least once every other week. Use the minimum and maximum markers etched inside the cells as a guide. Distilled water is recommended simply because it has no impurities in it. It therefore means that batteries do not need to work as hard to perform and they last longer as a result. 

, Motorcycle batteries should be charged once per week. Allowing them to be completely exhausted will only shorten their life and impact their performance. While they can be jump-started like car batteries, it is always better to just take care of them so this will be unnecessary.

Remove the forks.,
Do a preliminary clean.,
Unscrew the damping rod bolt.,
Do a final clean.,
Install the damping rod.,
Pour new oil.,

Replace the components.",How to Change the Oil in Motorcycle Forks," Follow your bike’s instructions on how to do this. As a general rule, you’ll need to either chock the front wheel or at least have the front brake engaged to when breaking the front axle bolt loose. Once that’s loose, you’ll need to jack the front up. There are two ways to do that.

One is to use a jack under the engine and lift the front wheel.
The other option is to use a front triple tree stand which lifts the bike using the triple tree. This is our preference as it offers a bit more stability than a jack. You’ll also need to disconnect the brakes and any other cables that might be connected to the forks such as speed sensors.;
, Here’s your first challenge. Depending on your bike, the forks will either have a cap you can simply screw off or in some rarer cases a plug that sits on top.

In either case, you’ll also need to remove a clip that holds the plug or the bottom of the cap in place. Because the front of your bike is now lifted up, the forks will be uncompressed making this task slightly easier. Push down on the cap/plug with an appropriate tool and using your other hand, use a flat head screwdriver or a box cutter to pry out the clip.

, The exact position that your forks sit in your triple tree determines the front end geometry of your bike so it’s important to that you measure this. Otherwise your bike’s handling could be vastly different upon re-installation. Using a ruler, measure how far up the fork extends above the triple tree (if at all). You’ll usually find there’s a mark on the top of the triple tree – measure from here as the height the fork is above the triple tree will vary depending on where you take the measurement., Loosen the bolts on the top and bottom of the triple tree. Once fully wound out, you’ll be able to gently slide each fork down and out of the clamps. When pouring the oil out of the forks, don’t just turn them upside down as that could potentially damage the springs inside. Instead, gently pour the fork oil out and ensure you grab any washers, spacers and the spring as they fall out., Pouring out the fork oil will still leave plenty of oil left inside. Get a degreaser and spray liberally inside the fork. Make sure you pump the forks up and down to get the degreaser to mix through both the inner and outer fork. Leave the degreaser in for a few minutes and then clean them out with water., At the bottom of the fork will be a bolt that holds the damping rod in place. You can skip this step if you want but you won’t get as much of the old fork oil out if you do. The location of the bolt is generally awkward so you might need to get creative to get enough leverage to loosen it. Another problem can be that the damping rod itself rotates while you’re trying to unscrew the bolt. If you find that this is the case, compress the fork and using the spring you just removed, put it back in.

Pushing down on the spring will hopefully hold the damping rod in place – at least enough to get the bolt loose. If this doesn’t work, a piece of dowel (or other appropriately shaped and long enough object) pushed into the top of the damping rod can also work.

, With the bottom bolt removed, spray some more degreaser inside the fork and pump them up and down. Let the degreaser sit and then cleanse with water. Leave the forks to dry. Give the springs, spacers and damping rod a spray with degreaser followed by a rinse of water too. Once the bolt is loose, the damping rod will now be fee to come out, so gently slide it out of the fork., Put some threadlock on the bolt that holds the damping rod in place and screw it in. Just like when removing the damping rod, compress the fork and with the spring, hold the damping rod in place to prevent it from rotating., Refer to your bike’s service manual for how much oil (and the weight) to put into your forks. Because in this guide we’re not taking the forks completely apart, there will still be old oil in them. Therefore, there’s two measurements to take note of – first is the amount of oil and secondly is the distance of the oil from the top of the forks. To accurately measure this as per manufacturers specifications, the damping rod should be in but nothing else – no spring, spacers, et cetera. Ensure you refer to the owners manual in case they recommend differently, however.

Ensure the fork is standing vertically on a level surface. Pour in the amount of oil recommended by the manufacturer. Before putting it all in, pump the forks up and down to circulate the oil throughout and remove any air trapped.
Now, refer to the second measurement which will say how far from the top of the fork the oil should sit. The best way to do this is using a fork oil measuring gauge which is simply a syringe with some flexible and fixed tubing. Simply measure the appropriate distance from the ring of the measuring gauge and set as so, then sit it on top of the fork. If you pull on the syringe and only suck in air, it means you don’t have enough oil in.
Top up the oil and then pull on the syringe again. If you initially suck oil up, that’s fine and continue to do so until you start to only get air. Once that happens your oil level is correct.

, Slide the forks up through the triple tree. Tighten the bolts on the triple tree by hand – just ensure there’s enough slack still to move the forks up and down slightly to position them correctly. Using the measurement you took before removing the forks to ensure that they’re sitting the appropriate distance above the top of the triple tree. Tighten the bolts as per their torque specifications., Gently put in the springs, spacers and washers followed by the fork caps. You’ll need to reinstall the clip holding the cap/plug in place but thankfully putting it in is easier then removing. Replace the front wheel and all other components and you’re finished."

",How to Buy Motorcycle Batteries," Motorcycle batteries that are well-maintained will last at least 3 years.;
, This is the type of battery you should buy.


Consult the handbook that came with your motorcycle. It should list the type of battery to use with your particular model.

, Even when you know what brand and model of battery to buy based on the type of motorcycle you have, there will still be choices.


Buy a maintenance-free motorcycle battery to cut down on water loss. This type of battery seals shut once it is filled with acid, so you will never need to fill it or check the fluid level.
Choose an AGM battery if you do not plan to charge it often. This type of motorcycle battery holds gravity longer than conventional batteries and will not need to be charged as frequently. It is a good choice for periods of winter storage.
Buy a conventional motorcycle battery if you want something rugged and reliable. These batteries are dependable and meet all industry standards. They work well in any weather and can handle vibrating surfaces or harsh environments.

, Those who live in hot climates such as Florida need a battery with a longer life.

, If you take short trips on your motorcycle, buy a battery that does not need to recharge often. The short distances do not allow the alternator to charge for very long.

, The person who sold you your motorcycle should be able to recommend and sell you a battery.


Prepare to pay a little more than if you shop on your own. However, it may be worth it since you will be following reliable advice.

, Retailers such as The Auto Zone, Advanced Auto Parts and Sears sell batteries for all motorcycle makes and models.


See if the associates at the store will help you install it. Sometimes they offer free installation with the purchase of a battery.

, Sites such as Battery Mart offer motorcycles batteries from all manufacturers.


Take advantage of the customer service hotline. Associates can help you choose your battery and answer any questions you might have while you are shopping.

The bung is located on the left hand side of the bike behind the stand and is covered by the stand when it's up. Use a spanner to unscrew it anti-clockwise and screw it clockwise to tighten it back up.


It's a lot easier to drain when the oil is warm, so warm up the bike with a bit of a drive after letting it idle for awhile.;
, If you're a little worried about the old oil being really dirty, you can buy some liquid from your local auto shop that goes in before draining the oil, to help it come out more easily and to get all the dirty oil out. Of course, note the instructions on the packet and check before buying whether it's for a motorbike or not.

, The oil filter is fixed by three screws, one long one and two smaller ones, so it's not easy to mix them up. The oil filter is located on the right hand side of the bike (note the previous photo for the location). The oil filter is quite simple to remove after the cap has been removed; just pull it out and wipe out the old oil with a rag. If you didn't note which way the filter came out, just make sure the hole on the filter goes in first.


The oil filter shown in this image is the old one after the new one was put in, and is somewhat dirty.
Watch out for oil coming out when you remove the cap holding the filter in.

, After the oil has finished draining out into the tray, screw the back on the bung (clockwise).

, After the bung is back on, it's time to fill the oil back up. Remember to use a funnel so you don't spill any oil anywhere. You will need to tilt the bike up straight and stop pouring to let the oil settle so that you can check the gauge to see how full the bike is. After you're sure you've got enough oil in, screw the cap back on and you're ready to go.


The bike is meant to take 1.4L (0.36 gallons) but you might overfill the bike to 2L (0.52 gallons) if you don't let the oil settle properly when checking the gauge.

, Pour the old oil into another container. Ask your auto store where you can recycle your old oil when you buy your oil for your oil change. Some landfills have special places for disposing of the oil, as do some municipalities. Do not just pour it down the drain!


Oil trays are super handy for when doing oil changes, especially with the end piece for pouring back into a container. They last for ages unless you're trying to break it.

Done.",How to Change a Sparkplug on a CBR 125 Motorcycle," You'll need the tool kit that came with the bike, and probably the manual to follow along with. You need your new spark plug CR8E (NGK) or U24ESR-N (DENSO). It costs about US$8.;
, By the manual you should have a gap that is 0.70-0.80mm (0.028-0.031 in).


You check this with something called a feeler gauge that looks like this picture. This tool is just a pocketknife full of different thicknesses of metal. The 'gap measurement' is the number stamped on the feeler blade that will fit between the plug's electrodes without being forced.

,


For guaranteed safety, you could disconnect the battery first. First locate the plug. You don't have to remove any parts of the faring (plastic body) to get at it. The plug has a connector wire on it that might be kind of hard to remove by hand. Treat things gently, you can use the small pliers in your toolkit to slowly and deliberately lift the wire straight off the plug.

, Clean around the plug and where it fits with the engine. Digging around here with a toothbrush is fine, maybe you have a real garage with compressed air? The point is to keep crud from falling to the inside of your engine -that would be bad.

, You have a spark plug tool, really just a crude socket. You will turn this with the '17' half of your wrench. If you've misplaced the original tools, the plug could be removed by a long socket, or some clever wrench that is 5/8.

, It's pretty close quarters in here.

, Again, this is a bit like open heart surgery. Nothing goes in here but the new plug.

, Old vs New. In this case we probably could have got away with scraping the old plug clean. But the plug is 2 years old already.

, FIRST screw the new plug in by hand until its firmly seated. Don't force anything, cross threading on the engine block itself would be horrible. Honda is pretty particular about tightening with the spark plug tool: New NGK Plug directions:
A) Tighten a 1/2 turn after plug seats.
B) Loosen the plug.
C) Now tighten plug again: 1/8 of a turn after it seats.

, This went back on a lot easier than it came off.

, It's pretty satisfying to do simple things with a bike yourself. This is simple enough that it can become an annual maintenance thing. A motorcycle should be a great way to learn more about mechanics. You don't need to have ramps, jacks, or a lift. Assuming you also have a car, if you fumble bike maintenance then you still have a ride in to work the next morning. Keep your mind and wrenches turning.

Have all the required materials ready before you start to remove the motorbike tire.,
Let all the air out of the tire with the valve core tool.,
Draw an arrow at the edge of the rim with your pencil so you can see the direction of the spin of the wheel.,
Detach the bead (the inner edge of the tire) from the rim using the bead breaker tool.,
Spray silicone lubricant on the tire bead to help it come out.,
Alternatively, use two C-clamps to push the bead out.,
Use two tire levers to pry the bead up and over the rim.,
Break the bead and pry out the tire on the other side to remove the rim.",How to Change a Motorcycle Tire1," These are basic tools required for changing motorcycle tires that you should be able to purchase at a motorcycle shop.


Spray-on silicone lubricant (or Windex)
Tire irons
Breezer tire tool
Valve core tool
Bead breaker (or two C-clamps)
Compressed air pump
Rim protector (optional);
, This tool is either snapped on or screwed into the valve to keep it open. The force of the air coming out is usually quite strong, so you will need to hold the valve core tool tightly.


This loosens the tension in the tire, making it much easier to work with.

, If you're unsure. hold the tire back up to the motorcycle, the way you took it off. Note how the wheel needs to spin, as this is essential when putting the next tire on.


Wheels spin towards the direction the bike is going.

, This is a metallic tool that can be inserted between the tire and wheel rim. You will hear a pop sound when the bead breaks loose. Continue to separate the tire from all edges of the rim on both sides.


A ""bead"" is a curved lip of the tire that goes right where the tire meets the rim and hold it in place.
If the bead isn't coming out, try to push more air out of the tires.

, This will allow you to slip the tire off the rim easily by entering tire irons under the bead and pulling the tire away from the rim. Remove both sides of the tire until the tire can slip off completely.


Every time you expose some of the tire bead, give it a spray. It will prevent it from re-sticking and making you start over.
You can also use some Windex.

, Take a large clamp and set it over the tire, right before the tire tucks into the rim. Tighten it so that the tired presses down and the bead starts to bend off. Then add one more clamp 6-8"" to the side of the first and repeat. Once they're both on, pull them towards the edge of the tire to pop the bead out. You might need to move both clamps a quarter turn down the wheel or so and repeat once more to get the whole bead off.


When down, the tire should sit just outside of the rim.

, Tire levers are simply long metal tabs. You shove them under the bead, so that the back side sits against the rim, and then push down to pull the tire up. The rim acts like a fulcrum, allowing you to pop the tire up and over the rim. Move in a circle around the tire until the tire is off.


This may chip or nick your rim if you're not careful -- buy some rim protectors, little foam pieces that fit between the tire iron and the rim, to protect it if you're worried., Repeat the procedure on the opposite side to take the wheel out completely. It should be easier on this side.

Lubricate the inner walls of the new tire thoroughly.,
Place the new motorbike tire so its spin direction matches the direction you marked earlier on the rim.,
Attach one side of the tire to the rim, using the tire irons to pry it in.,
Pump some air into the tire using a compressed air pump, but do not inflate it fully.,
Seal the tire bead into the rim using the Breezer tire tool if you can't get the ""pop"" while inflating.,
Pump some ceramic dust into the tire.,
Use a valve stem tool to reinsert the valve stem.,
Inflate your new tire to the recommended pressure.",How to Change a Motorcycle Tire2," Use your lubricated spray or Windex. As you work with the new tire, keep spraying it to keep it slippery and easier to work with.

, There is also a red dot on the tire that should be located next to the valve stem. Make sure you note this dot and the spin of the tire and set it up

, This time, the tire wall will be placed between the tire iron and the rim so the tire iron can push the tire into the rim. The bead of the tire acts as the fulcrum, with you pushing away from the center of the tire to ease the bead under the rim.


Repeat on the other side once the first is in.

, You just want to pump until you hear a small ""pop."" This indicates the bead has popped in.


You can also take a small hammer and hit the tire around the bead as you fill it up. This will shift the tires slightly as it fills, making it more likely that it slips into the bead.

, You can use this tool to press the bead in and then rotate the tire to get the bead in from all edges.


Do not keep pumping up if you can't get the bead in. Let some air back out, then re-pump and use the tool.
When the tire is not fully inflated, you can usually rotate it a bit still. Make sure that red dot is balanced with the valve stem.

, Squirt a bit of ceramic dust (made for tires) into the tire valve. It keeps the tire balanced and equalizes some of the weight, balancing out any issues. Do this before putting the valve stem back on.

, Tighten it back on and make sure it doesn't move.

, Pump the tire up to normal and you're good to ride!

This type of tires offer excellent traction and an aggressive tread pattern that can handle different elements like mud, rock, and sand. They are more expensive than the regular UTV tires.
, They provide additional ground clearance on the UTV. This upgrade is essential particularly while travelling on a challenging trail where the undercarriage might get damaged by different elements like water, rocks and sand., Aftermarket shocks are also a UTV must have. They perform better than the stock UTV shocks, providing an improved ride quality., They last longer than regular tie rod ends and offers an improved handling even through the harshest road condition., They are proven to boost the horsepower of the UTV and give it a more aggressive look and sound., LED light bars are a must for extreme riders who love to take their UTVs out for a ride during the night., This functional upgrade protects the rider from the getting wet during the rain. It also provides shade under the heat of the unforgiving sun., Windshields shield the rider from dust, rock and insects. UTV windshields are available in glass and plastic materials., Spending a long day in a bumpy trail can be very painful to the backside. Investing in aftermarket seats are a must. They are proven to be more comfortable than stock UTV seats., This prevents sticks, stones and other kinds of debris that you may encounter while riding through a trail., Roll cages are another favorite aftermarket upgrade. These are reinforcements that protect the rider and passenger typically during off-roading adventures, where accidents have high occurrence., These are heavy duty front and rear bumpers that offer greater protection to the UTV., They protect the undercarriage of the UTV from road hazards like rocks. Unlike the 4x4 vehicles, UTV skid plates are typically made of durable plastic that also serve as a shock absorber., Winches are a must have accessory.

Finished.
",How to Be Safe on an All Terrain Vehicle," It is important to know your local and state laws before you begin to ride. A good course will not only cover state guidelines, but also review proper gear, tips for navigating hills and turns, and important life saving tips.
, Always wear a properly fit helmet. The helmet should be snug and unable to move when the rider shakes their head. Chin harness must be secure, rider should feel pressure under their chin. The ATV safety institute recommends a long sleeve shirt, long pants, good gloves and boots that cover the ankle. Goggles are recommended; make sure they are free of scratches and fit securely around the head., Check the brakes and brake lights. Inspect the throttle. It must return to position immediately when it is released. Measure the air pressure in the tires; refer to the manufactures recommended level. Check headlights, always ride on a full tank of gas. Inspect the chains and drive shaft. Chain should have proper slack and lubrication. Nuts and bolts may loosen with ATV use, check to make sure they are snug., The places you will be riding generally won't be as well-kept as the roads, so be careful., Floods and rain cause poor traction, and in snow you may sink. Getting a strong headwind while riding fast could cause you to flip over., The momentum could throw you forward and lead to possible injury., When ascending, plant your feet firmly, keep a good grip on the handlebars and keep your weight toward the front of the ATV. When descending keep weight toward the rear of the ATV. Use your brakes gradually as you go down and look ahead at all times. Always maintain a safe speed; do not accelerate quickly. When traveling in a group, keep a safe distance between all riders especially on hills.,, Do not travel on public roads., Release the parking brake and slowly apply the throttle. Test the brakes one more time while going a slow speed., If your ATV begins to tip during a turn, lean your body further into your turn and gradually decrease speed., A quick sharp turn can lead to an accident.,"
"
Drain all air from the ATV tires you want to change.,
Break the seal between the tire and the wheel.",How to Change an ATV Tire1," You can do this quickly by removing the valve stems with a valve stem remover or slowly by depressing the nut inside the valve stem.;
, This is a wire rim in your ATV tire that sits in a groove in the wheel. You can break this seal by pressing hard on the sidewall of the tire.


In some models of ATV tire, you will find a tab you must flip to release the wire rim.

"
Wedge in the flat blade of your tire iron between the edge of the ATV tire and the rim of the wheel.

,
Wedge the second tire iron in about 8 inches (20.3 cm) along the rim from the first.

,
Slide the second tire iron around the rim of the wheel until it makes contact with the first.",How to Change an ATV Tire2,",,


With some tires, this will be sufficient to fully remove the ATV tire. With others, you'll have to repeat with the opposite edge of the tire.

"
"
Set the new ATV tire on top of your wheel.,
Lever one section of the tire onto the wheel using your tire iron.,
Slide the other tire iron in place and pass it around to set the tire on the wheel.,
Repeat with the opposite wall of the tire, if necessary.,
Fill the new ATV tires with air using an air compressor.

",How to Change an ATV Tire3," Do this with the wheel lying on a wide, flat surface. The wheel won't be as stable as when you were removing the old tire.

, Be careful not to cut or otherwise damage the new ATV tire.

,


This is essentially the same process as removing the old ATV tire, reversed.
This step may be easier if you apply a thin layer of lubricant to the edge of the ATV tire.

, As with getting tires off, some models will require this step, while others will fall into place with just the first pass.

Learn the location and placement of your vehicle's wheels.",How to Go Off Roading,"


Older Jeeps are the best.
New Wranglers are good but they cost a lot!
The best off road vehicles are small with lots of ground clearance.;
, They are just too big to fit on trails.

, Extra oil, spare tire, jack, water, and things for you in case of that small chance you get stuck and have to hike back.

, Old Mountain Back roads that aren't used often are usually good for beginners.

,,, Some may be too big to straddle. If you try to drive straight over a rock that is too big you can damage the bottom of your vehicle or crack the engine's oil pan and then you and your vehicle are stuck.

,, This will help you get through difficult spots without the help of a spotter to tell you where to drive.


Practice using a setup of aluminum soda cans in a parking lot. Try to crush each can with the passenger side tires. Successfully doing this in reverse a few times is very helpful when you find yourself at the dead end of the wrong trail.

Acquire a Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle.,
Acquire your replacement parts.,
Place your VW on jack stands.,
Strip down your VW Beetle.,
Paint the frame, and add any desired extras to your DIY dune buggy.",How to Build a Dune Buggy1," Newer styles don't work as well as the Type 1. Type 1 VW Beetles are the models from the 1970s and can commonly be found in Arizona and Texas because VW production was transferred to Mexico during that time.;
, These may include a megaphone exhaust, tires, shock absorbers, and springs.


A good source for parts is eBay Motors, as well as dune buggy specialty stores such as AppleTreeAuto.com or Chirco.com.







, To avoid serious injury or worse, make sure the vehicle is secure before crawling around underneath it. It's more fun for you to be inside the car, rather than the car being inside you.

, Strip it down till it contains only the bare essentials: the frame, engine, suspension, steering wheel, tires, brakes, and some type of seat. Everything else is unnecessary and can be stripped away. Use the leftover parts to make scrap metal sculptures, or sell the parts on eBay.


Remove the fenders, bumpers, and trunk lid. Remember that the trunk of a VW Beetle is in the front and the engine is in the back.






Replace the tires, wheels, suspension, and exhaust. Since your vehicle is older, these components are likely to be in poor shape. Remove the wheels and tires since you will be replacing the tires and reusing the wheels if they still are in decent shape. Make sure to keep the lug nuts from the wheels.






Replace the suspension components, such as the shock absorbers and springs. Obtain taller springs so that your dune buggy will sit higher off the ground.






Remove the exhaust pipe with a reciprocating saw. Make your cut 5 inches (13 cm) from the header flange. Install the megaphone exhaust at a 45-degree angle, thoroughly reading the manufacturer's instructions.






Install your new tires onto the factory wheels, and attach to the VW by tightening the lug nuts. Remove your dune buggy from the jack stand.







, If you prefer to modify the engine, the Chevrolet Corvair engine is a popular upgrade choice. This allows you to upgrade to 6 cylinders and creates the possibility of achieving up to 80 horsepower (130 kW).

"
"
Visit Google.com.,
Purchase plans.",How to Build a Dune Buggy2," There are dune buggy kits available for all tastes, levels of experience, and pocketbooks.


For example, a company such as Berrien Buggy (www.berrienbuggy.com) has various body styles, frames, etc. so that you can build a custom buggy using pre-built parts.






Another option is a completely pre-designed kit—all you do is the assembly. A company such as Myers Manx (www.meyersmanx.com) is a good example of this type of kit.







, If you want to build from scratch, but don't want to design it all yourself, purchase a set of plans. They're normally about $25 to $35 USD (as of 2012). You source the parts and components yourself, so there is potential savings in finding the best price for each individual item.


Amazon is a good source for plans.






Most dune buggy sites have community forums. Spend some time seeing what people are talking about—you can glean a lot of good information by seeing what people like, and what they don't like about any given company or product.

Make sure your carbs are clean and in perfect working order.,
Pull off the little rubber covers, or screws, that hold the vacuum passage shut on each carb.,
Open and close the throttle a few times, then let her idle.,
Loosen the countering nuts on the butterfly valve adjusting screw of each carb.,
Once you have acquired that, and have also tightened the countering nuts, and the needles are still in perfect synchronicity, voila!",How to Synchronize Motorcycle Carburettors1," Clean the bowls, the jets and passages, the rubber diaphragms under the top lid have no holes, and your carb needles, as well as the floats are hung in the right positions, as indicated by the workshop manual for your machine. Check the rubber manifolds for leaks, and make sure your idle mixture screws are adjusted to the indicated number of turns. Your bike should now idle somewhat peacefully.

Twist the idle mixture screw on each carb - you will notice that the engine idles faster or slower. The spot where it idles fastest is the right one, find that on all the carbs, all the while re-adjusting your main idle to the revs indicated in your manual, usually a bit less than 1000 rpm on a 4-cylinder. Congratulations, you have adjusted and synchronized the idle speed!;
, Attach the hoses from the vacuum gauges, and start the engine. Preferably, it is already warmed up., You will have noticed the indicating needles on the gauges going up when you open the throttle, and fluttering like mad when idling. First, let's take care of the fluttering.

Every clock has a little screw, where the tube gets in or nearby. Twist that until the fluttering calms, but does not stop completely. Gun the engine in between adjusting, until all the needles on the clocks are fluttering somewhat calmly at idle. Open her up, and see those needles rise... to quite different places on the clock. Your next step will be to make them rise in unison.

, Depending on your bike, you might have one carb that cannot be adjusted: that is the one to which the others have to be adjusted to.

Loosen or tighten those screws, bit by bit, opening up the throttle in between, until all the needles on the gauges rise and fall simultaneously, in perfect harmony. This does take its time, and can be a bit frustrating, not to mention noisy. Patience and perseverance does it!

, You have successfully synchronized your carbs! However, if your machine, and her carbs, is old and worn, you might never get those needles to behave like a well trained dance troupe. For all those that just want to keep the old beater running, preferably at a tolerable pace, there is a second way of adjusting it."
"
Use this method if you can't do it the ""real"" way.,

Empty the bowls, loosen the clamps and pull the carbs off!,
Slowly open the throttle.,
Re-attach the carbs, and all their hoses.",How to Synchronize Motorcycle Carburettors2," Maybe you don't have vacuum measuring gauges, are too poor to buy some, or the old horse is just too worn out for them to work correctly? Stuck in the middle of some godforsaken place without any mechanics, workshops, anything? Fear not, my friend, here's the bush method for synching your carbs. All you need is a few little metal balls from an old ball bearing, of about 5mm in diameter, one for each carb, easily found in any scrap yard, and added to your emergency tool kit., If the engine revs higher when you spray a particular spot, that's where an air leak is. Close it with some liquid gasket or chewing gum. Yes, it works, at least for some miles. (Most of the times, this is what caused your previously nicely adjusted carbs to act up in the first place.), Leave them attached to the throttle. Place them, level, over a level cardboard box or something. Put a ball from a ball bearing in each., Stare in wonder at the butterfly valves opening. Listen to the sound of the little balls falling through onto the cardboard - ""ploploploplop"". Adjust the butterfly valve screws until you hear just one plop. There you you go, carbs are synched up!, Ride off into the sunset!"

Remove the bar ends.,
Cut off the grips.,
Clean the handlebars.",How to Replace Motorcycle Hand Grips1," These are the metal pieces on the outside ends of the handlebars. Depending on the model of your motorcycle, you can either pop them off or unscrew them with a flathead screwdriver.






;
, Use a razor blade or a hacksaw to cut the grips lengthwise and pull them off of the handlebars. As you're cutting, apply enough pressure to slice through the grip, but not so much that you scratch the metal handlebar beneath it.









Be careful not to cut through any wires on the handlebar. Take your time when you're slicing off the grips.
If you want to save the grips, you can blow them off with compressed air. Most people don't have compressed air available at home, so you'll likely have to take your motorcycle to a mechanic to have this done.
Another method to try for saving the grips is slipping a flathead screwdriver between the grip and the handlebar and using it to work the grip off. If there's a lot of adhesive holding the grip in place, this method is difficult.
If you have chrome grips, skip the razor blade and simply unscrew the bolts at the ends of the grips and slide them off.

, Use rubbing alcohol or adhesive remover and a rag to remove remnants of the previous grips. Make sure the grips and the adhesive that attached them to the metal is completely gone before proceeding.









Don't attempt to use any type of oil-based cleaner or lubricant to remove the adhesive. In order for the new grips to stay firmly in place on the handlebars, the metal must be completely free of residue. Using lubricant may cause the new grips to slip, which could result in a dangerous situation on the road.
Make sure the handlebar is clean and dry before proceeding.

Sort out which grip goes on which side.,
Install the non-throttle grip.,
Install the throttle grip.,
Replace the bar ends.,
Let the glue dry.",How to Replace Motorcycle Hand Grips2," The two grips that come in a package have slightly different-sized holes. The one that is slightly larger is meant to be installed on the side of the throttle, which is usually the right side. The smaller one should be installed on the side without the throttle.








, Apply a grip glue, such as E-6000, inside the hand grip opening and along the handlebar. The edge of one side of the grip is raised, while the other edge is not. Slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, before the glue begins to dry. Keep pushing until the raised edge of the grip is flush against the inside of the handlebar. When it's secure in place, squeeze the grip to help the glue set.









Don't use too much adhesive; apply just enough to hold the grip in place. If you use too much adhesive it will squeeze out the ends of the grip and make a mess.
Make sure to work quickly enough that the glue doesn't dry before you replace the grip. If it becomes hard to work with, use rubbing alcohol to remove the grip glue and start over.
If you don't have grip glue, try the hairspray method, advocated by many seasoned motorcyclists.

, Apply the glue to the grip meant for the throttle side as well as the handlebar. Quickly slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, until it is flush against the inside of the handlebar. Squeeze the grip to help the glue set.








, Screw the ends of the handlebars back on so that the grips are held firmly in place.








, Wait several hours for the glue to dry before using the motorcycle. When it's dry, test the grips to make sure you like them. If you find them to be uncomfortable, replace them using the same method.

Know your motorcycle.,
Determine what type of riding you like to do.,
Consider personal preferences.",How to Replace Motorcycle Hand Grips3," Every motorcycle has certain specifications as to which type of grip is best suited to the model. It's important to choose a grip that works with your motorcycle to make sure your ride is safe and comfortable. If you aren't sure what type of grips are best for your motorcycle, ask a motorcycle mechanic or the dealership where you bought your motorcycle.









Examine your handlebar. There are ape hangers, beach bars, clubman bars, Motocross bars, drag bars, and other styles of handlebar, each requiring different grips. Take this into account when you make your purchase.
Make sure the grips you buy are the right diameter and length. Most motorcycle grips are either 7/8"" or 1"" in diameter and about 5"" long. To figure out which diameter and length you need, measure the old grips before purchasing new ones.
Some motorcycles produce greater vibrations than others. These need thick, padded grips to protect your hands from becoming numb after a few minutes of riding.

, The type of grip you buy should depend on what conditions you'll be encountering on your motorcycle. If you like to go off-roading, you'll need to be able to grip the handlebars without your hands slipping. If you like to ride long distances on the highway, it's more important to choose comfortable grips that won't make your hands hurt.









Grips made of rubber are designed to absorb sweat so that your hands won't slip, no matter how wet or sweaty they get. They provide the best grip and control of all hand grip materials. Choose these if you ride for sport, especially during the hot summer months.

Grips made from soft foam with leather straps are more comfortable, and they prevent your hands from hurting when you have to grip the handlebars for several hours at a time.

, Aside from the practical factors that play a role in what grips you choose, your personal preferences as a motorcycle rider will also inform your decision. Determine your preferences in the following areas:









Cost. The price range of grips runs from very low to very high. If you ride your motorcycle infrequently, a cheap pair of rubber grips will do the trick. If you ride frequently or over long distances, you may want to invest in something more expensive.
Comfort. You can buy ergonomic grips designed make your hands and fingers as comfortable as possible, but many people do just fine with standard grips.
Style. Choose a pair of grips that matches your motorcycle's style, especially if you're investing in grips that are on the expensive side of the price range.

First thing is to get a jack ready for the Goldwing, make sure it's a sturdy jack.,
Pull the upper side mudguard/fender trim off as in the first picture below (right side shown).,
Remove the 8mm bolt from the top of the rotor cover and bracket and remove the rotor cover as shown below.,
Remove the two Allen bolts holding the brake calipers in place and slide the calipers off the brake disc as shown in the next three pictures.

,
Now remove the 22mm bolt from the right-side of the axle, as in the first picture.,
With the Goldwing jacked up, push the axle out with a drift from the right side, then pull it fully out to the left as shown in the two pictures below.

,
Pull the speedo drive away as you roll the wheel out as in the picture.,
On the right side, note the spacer that sits in the middle of the wheel shown in the picture.,
When refitting the wheel, note the points I made about the spacer and the speedo drive.",How to Remove a GL1500 Goldwing Front Wheel," The bottom of the GL1500 engine is flat and ideal for jacking up. A flat block of wood between the jack and engine will prevent the GL1500 sump being damaged by the jack and will also be less likely to slip. Don't jack the Goldwing up just yet.;
, Then remove the lower 8mm bolts from the rotor covers. Don't lose the spacers visible in the third picture.

, Note how the two-part bracket slots together in the first picture. These brackets sit over the top of the rotor trim, not under it.

,, Then slacken off the fork to axle pinch bolts as shown in the following two. There is no need to remove these bolts. In the third picture, I've highlighted the small stop on the fork leg. When refitting the speedo drive, make sure that the stop on the drive is behind the one on the fork leg, otherwise when you ride the Goldwing the drive will turn forward and break the speedo cable. Now it's time to jack the Goldwing up so that the wheel is about an inch off the ground.

,, You don't need to remove the speedo cable from the drive first, you can remove them together. You may need to jack the Goldwing up a bit more so the wheel clears the mudguard/fender.

, The flared end faces against the fork leg and the other end sits into the bearing dust seal in the wheel.

, The last thing you will be doing is putting the mudguard/fender back in place. Make sure that you push the rear end in so it's flush with the rear of the fender, as shown in this picture. Many people don't push the trims in fully and of course they fall off when you take the Goldwing for a ride.

Remove all of the existing paint.,
Cover all openings with duct tape, and use a utility knife to trim the tape before you paint a motorcycle tank.,
Apply a minimum of 5 coats of primer.,
Apply several coats of base paint, and sand with 380-grit sandpaper in between coats.,
Air brush and add designs, if desired.








,
Apply 3 to 4 coats of clear coat polymer.",How to Paint a Motorcycle Tank," Use a sandblaster to sand the tank down to bare metal. Sandblasting might leave some cracks and holes, so use a metal filler to fill in cracks and a body filler to fill in holes. Use a piece of 180-grit sandpaper over the surface repeatedly until it is smooth to the touch.






;
, Cover any areas where the rubber gaskets contact the gas tank as this will prevent the paint from getting inside the gas tank. This would include areas in the filler neck area, the petcock assembly, and where the fuel gauge mounts to the tank.








, Allow each coat to dry. After each coat is dry, sand it and apply another coat until you have 5 layers.








, Allow each coat to dry before proceeding to the next coat.








,, Allow to dry. This will protect your tank in case you drip gasoline on it while using a gasoline pump.

Apply two coats of clearcoat lacquer to finish and protect your paint job from the elements.",How to Paint a Motorcycle," Though you’ll take steps to protect this area, don’t create the booth somewhere where an errant paint stain will be a big problem. A garage or storage area would be your best options.;
, You can buy plastic sheeting at any home improvement store like Lowe’s or Home Depot. Make sure you buy enough to protect the whole area.


Use thumbtacks or a hammer and nails to hang the sheeting up on the walls.
Use masking tape to secure the bottom of the sheet to the floor. This will prevent the sheets from billowing out and allowing paint to stain the wall.

, Place it somewhere where it will blow fumes out of the room or space, so you don’t inhale too much of it.

, It’s important that you can see what you’re doing, so place extra lights in the area where you’ll be working. Floor lamps would work well, but you can place side table lamps or desk lamps on a flat, elevated surface, as well.


You can also increase the brightness in the room by adding reflective materials such as aluminum sheets or mirrors on the walls.

, This article will use the tank as an example, but the same basic method should be applied to all bike pieces. The tank is a great place to start if you’re new to painting motorcycles because it’s fairly easy to remove and has broad, flat surfaces that are easy to work with.


Check which size allen wrench you need to remove the bolts holding the tank in place.
Remove all the bolts holding it in place and lift the tank off the frame. Set it aside.
Store the bolts in a plastic baggie clearly marked as “tank bolts.”

, This part will take some time and elbow grease, but it’s an important step. If the surface you’re painting isn’t perfectly smooth, you’ll end up with an ugly, uneven coat of paint on your bike, and nobody wants that.


Purchase sandpaper at any home improvement or hardware store, like Home Depot or Lowe’s.
Rub the metal surface down with sandpaper in a circular motion until you have removed the old paint.
You should be down to bare metal by the end of the process.
Switch back and forth between arms to prevent fatigue and soreness.
Take a break if you need one. You don’t have to finish this project in one sitting.

, Remove any residual dust or particles that might be on the surface. You want to be working with a clean canvas.

, You can purchase body filler at any automotive retailer, from O’Reilly’s to Auto Zone, and also in many home improvement stores.


Mix the filler up well to make sure it’s loose and not clumpy when applied. It hardens quickly, so repeat the process in small batches as often as necessary.
Apply it in a layer about 1/8” thick.

, You want to wait about an hour to make sure the surface has dried completely and ready for a second sanding.If you’re not satisfied that the surface is perfectly smooth and ready to be painted, apply another layer of body filler and sand it down again.
When you’re satisfied with the smoothness of the surface, move on to the next phase: painting your bike.

, This will help protect the metal against moisture down the road, preventing unwanted effects like rusting.


Follow the instructions on the packaging for the brand you purchase to figure out which hardener you should mix it with. Make sure to do this at the automotive store so you can buy the hardener at the same time.
These products can vary significantly in their treatment needs, so don’t work by a rule of thumb — always follow the specific instructions.
Mix the primer with the hardener.
Pour the solution into the can of your spray gun.
Apply one coat evenly onto the bike, allow it to dry, then repeat.
Follow the recommended drying times on the packaging for the primer you bought.
When applying any product with a spray gun, make sure to move the spray slowly and evenly across the surface.

, Most primers leave a powdery texture behind, especially after multiple coatings, so you want to smooth the bike back down to a level surface.


Use a 2000-grit wet-and-dry sandpaper.

, Don’t use enough thinner to strip the primer, just enough to wipe down the newly sanded surface.

, You don’t want any of the epoxy primer mixing in with the paint you want to apply.

, As with the epoxy primer, use the ratio recommended by the packaging on the specific product you buy. Again, you want to make sure you’ve mixed the products thoroughly. This will prevent clogging in the spray gun and ensure a smooth coat on your motorcycle.

, You’ll sand down the bike before applying the final layer.


Let each layer dry completely between applications, using the drying times recommended on the paint packaging.After the third layer of paint has dried, sand the surface again with a 2000-grit wet-and-dry sandpaper. You want to surface to be perfectly smooth in preparation for the final coat of paint.
Wipe the surface down with a clean rag after sanding.
Apply the final coat of paint and let it dry.
Clean the spray gun thoroughly again after applying your final coat of paint.

, Follow the recommendations on the lacquer packaging to determine how long you should let it cure before applying the second coat.


If, after the second coat of lacquer has cured, you’re satisfied with the final product, you’re done!
If there are still inconsistencies, sand it once more with 2000-grit wet-and-dry sandpaper, then reapply a coat of clearcoat lacquer to your satisfaction.

If your school is having meetings that will provide more information about the trip, attend them. If it's after or before school, see if you can have your parent(s) attend the meetings with you.;
, Sometimes schools have lists to say whether you can or cannot bring something.They will usually give you a list of what to bring or what you cannot bring. Especially for phones, electronics and/or snacks.

, Check the weather for your destination(s) for the day(s) which you will be there. Try using www.weatherbug.com, www.accuweather.com, or any other weather website applicable to your location.

, Include chargers, cell phones, iPods, money, stationery, books, etc. Try packing a small pillow or pillow pet and a small blanket (fleece maybe?). Sometimes your school gives you a list of necessary items so remember to pack those.

Make sure your bottles have replaceable lids. The screw-on kind is best.
Bring bottles with small-mouthed openings. Bus rides are notoriously bumpy, so if you bring wide-mouthed bottles, you might end up soaked.;
, Since you may not have access to healthy food at your bus stops, you may want to pack nutritious food from home. Snacks like boiled eggs, fruit, sandwiches, and nuts are easily transportable and healthy., Pre-packaged granola bars, crackers, cookies, chips, candy, and gum are great traveling companions. Since they are already divided up into individual serving sizes, they are perfect for snacking when you’re on the go.

, If you are going to be traveling by bus for any length of time, you’re probably going to need some entertainment. Bring an assortment of your favorite tunes and don’t forget your earbuds or headphones. “People watching” the strange characters on your bus is only fun for so long.

, Just to repeat, you will need entertainment. You can only talk to your seatmate about her various ailments for so long. Bring along that book you’ve been meaning to read or catch up on the latest installment in your favorite series.

, On your laptop or iPad, make sure to bring along some outlines or rough drafts for memos, reports, or articles that you can work on while on the road. If there's any work you can get done while you're on the bus, it's a great way to pass the time.

, As you stare out your window at the new scenery passing by, look for inspiration! Write (or type) in your journal about your travel experiences. Work on a blog post, create a poem, song, or story, or simply put your feelings down into words.

, Before you get on board, make sure you’ve downloaded a reliable GPS app. You may not be able to get reliable wifi in some of the areas you’ll be traveling, so having a handy navigation app at the ready will be important. It's also a great way to pass the time as you watch the miles clicking by to your destination., It’s hard to move around on bus, especially without annoying those around you! Keep in mind that your spine is designed to move, so sitting in one position for a long time can make your back muscles stiff.


Stand up when you can to stretch (every 30 minutes if possible) so you can activate your core muscles. Stretching stimulates blood flow, and blood brings oxygen and nutrients to your back’s soft tissues. Even 10 seconds of standing to stretch is better than none!
Moving around also helps to prevent blood clots from forming in your legs. This is one of the most dangerous risks of sitting still for long periods of time.

, Sitting can cause all kinds of tension and stiffness in your body, but sometimes standing up to stretch is just not an option. Try some of these stretches that you can do while in a seated position.You can stretch your hamstrings while sitting. Sit on the edge of your seat and straighten one leg in front of you (as much as possible) with the heel on the floor. Sit straight up and arch your back without leaning the trunk of your body forward. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times for each leg.
Stretch your hip flexor muscles while sitting. Sit on the edge of your seat, lean forward, and put one leg behind you (probably under your bus seat) as far as you can while anchoring your toe on the floor. Then sit up straight while keeping your leg behind you. Hold the position for 30 seconds then repeat with the other leg.

, Sitting for a long time can strain your low back. Even more strain is put on your spine when you sit with poor posture. Check yourself from time to time so you can self-regulate your sitting position.


Make sure your back is aligned against the back of your seat when you are in a sitting position.
Adjust your headrest so that it is supporting the middle of the back of your head.
Keep your shoulders straight as much as possible, and try to avoid hunching forward.
While sitting, make sure that both of your feet are resting on the footrest or on the floor in front of you.

, Comfortable clothing will allow you to move freely and rest more easily. Dress in layers, because unlike in your car, you won’t be able to change the temperature of the bus. Use a tank or tee as your base, and then try putting a long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt over it.Think about bringing along a large, thin scarf. A scarf can be used not only for warmth and fashion, but for coverage if you find yourself without an available bathroom, to cover your eyes if you’re trying to sleep, or if you roll it up, as a makeshift pillow.

, Sometimes your earbuds just won’t cut it, and you will need to drown out crying babies, snorers, coughers, squeaking brakes, barking dogs, etc. If you are planning to sleep at all, bring ear plugs. It’s better to have them and not need them than to need them and not have them., If you’re going on a long trip, a small travel pillow will be indispensable for saving your neck and shoulder muscles. The seats on buses often don't provide the right kind of support for your lower back and neck. A travel pillow can be used to support your lower back, rest your head and neck, and make your seat more comfortable., Sit straight up in the bus seat, the way it is designed with your feet down and your head up. There may be a lack of back support but you can use your pillow or scarf to help you get more comfortable.

, Recline the bus seat as far as you can and curl up on your side. This will offer relief for your lower back but it may hurt your neck. Use your travel pillow, jacket or scarf to help maintain a comfortable position.

, If you’re lucky enough to get a window seat, you can lean against the side of the bus for support. If not, you may have to rest your head against the seat next to you. This offers a little bit of head and neck support, but it might be a bumpy ride!

, In other words, sleep in the fetal position. Scrunch down in your seat with your knees curled up in front of you against the back of the seat that’s in front of you. Try not to kick or push the seat of the person in front of you.

, Or talk to your friends. If the trip leaves in the evening (overnight ride) then you can sleep too. Eat/drink any snacks you brought. Once you get to a rest stop text/call your parents and let them know what's up. Sometimes the bus will even have television so you will spend a lot of time watching it.

, As you go on the trip, lots of stuff can go past you. You can count red cars, bicycles, hefty lorries, or you can also play an alphabet game where you try to find all the letters of the alphabet on billboards, shop signs, or license plates.

, Anyone can participate and the winner could get some free snacks.

, Even better, sing it with your friend(s)! Even have a singing contest!

, If they're asleep or unable to talk to you, a good idea is to look out the window or talk to other friends in front, behind, or across the aisle from you.

, You can play hangman, tic tac toe, MASH or any other travel games. Bring compact/travel games such as cards. If you're really lucky your bus will have a TV and a DVD player on it so you can watch a video. Most schools rent buses with luggage racks, very nice spacious seats, and TVs with DVD players.

, If you ran out of snacks or forgot to pack some, then go into the rest stop and buy some from the vending machines. Use the bathroom when you need it. Remember to take some pictures of your friends and scenery to remember it by! Try to hurry so you don't miss the bus!

, If you and your friend both have a DS then ask to borrow a game/trade one for a while. Try to take pictures of your friends or maybe trade iPods with one of your friends for a change in music.

, Make a new friend! Maybe that shy, but sweet girl, who's a total nerd? Don't judge! You may have a lot in common! If it is an overnight trip but you can't seem to fall asleep then put earphones on and snuggle up in a blanket and fall asleep.

, Sometimes people will wave back at you or maybe they will wave first!

Decide On Destination to Be Traveled.,
Decide On Date to Travel


At the very first stage you must be flexible with your dates.,
Book Service of Reputed Company


Before you reserve services of any charter bus company, plan to visit various websites to compare amenities, services and pricing.",How to Plan a Trip with a Charter Bus Service,"


You must wisely decide about the destination that you are willing to travel. Once you have made a decision you are required to choose a charter company so as to reserve your accommodation. Create a list of the activities which your passengers will participate in on the trip. If you have decided to visit some of the well known museums and theme parks then it is suggested that before your tour group arrives at the venue, that you contact them in advance to inquire about group discounts, admission fees, special accommodations for babies, disabled, or elderly passengers. Most venues will offer you discounts based on the number of members visiting their venue.





;
, Once you have decided about the dates you can approach a coach company and find out whether the charter bus is available or not on that particular date. If there is no availability for your desired date of travel, with the help of company personnel, you can find alternate travel dates for your trip. Most companies will allow you to reserve the coaches one or two months in advance. If you have made any changes in your plans and date(s) then immediately inform the company of the changes in the travel schedule, or you may forfeit your deposit or in some cases be liable to pay for a trip that you don't actually take!







, It is wise, if not essential for you to go to various websites to get an in depth understanding about their services. Note their contact details and pay attention to the differences in the pricing and payment structures. Make a thorough comparison between the companies and go with one which you feel is appropriate for your travel needs and which suits your budget. Price will be based on a number of factors: the distance to be traveled, number of passengers traveling, type of coach selected, additional excursions to entertainment facilities, entrance fees, tollgate fees, other service charges, etc. Once you have made a comparison you can proceed in selecting the company that offers you the best services and best quoted prices for your purposes.

Decide what kind of company you want to go with, and see if they have a training program.Your main options are a city bus driver, a long-distance bus driver, or a school bus driver.
Decide based on what appeals to you most. For instance, you may not want to be a long-distance driver if you have a family to come home to. On the other hand, you may not want to be a school bus driver if you don't like kids much.;
, Most companies have basic qualifications you need to meet. For instance, you often need to be 21 to drive a bus. You'll also need to pass a background check and physical to drive. The physical is important because you'll be required to do some heavy lifting, such as pulling out ramps and lifting or tying down wheelchairs.You'll also need to have a clean driving record and have been driving for at least 3 years.

, When you're working with a company, they will provide the training. You'll likely complete about six weeks of training.However, if you prefer, you can pay for private training with a company that specializes in the license you need to drive a bus., In most states, you must get a CDL license to drive a bus. Many states also require you to get a special endorsement on top of that if you're driving a school bus.You may also need the passenger endorsement, no matter what type of bus you're driving.You'll need to study your state's laws and pass a written exam to get this license. You'll also need to pass a driving test. Contact your local department of motor vehicles to find out what material you need to study and what tests you'll need to take. If you're getting your license through a company, they should assist you with this information.
For these licenses, you may also need to meet certain criteria, such as passing a background check and physical exam, just as if you were training with a company.
If you don't have a license, you can be fined or even put in jail for multiple offenses., Just like in a car, you need to adjust your seat when you get in. This step is especially important when driving buses, as other people may be driving the same bus when you're not on shift. Also, adjust the steering wheel so you can comfortably control it.Adjusting the mirrors is also essential. Make sure that you can see the rear wheels in the outside ones, as well as the road behind it. On the inside mirror, you should be able to see the inside of the bus and the road behind the bus.
The cross-view mirrors should help you see the front of the bus, what you can't see from your seat without mirrors.

, Put the parking brake on if it is not already set. Stomp on the clutch pedal if your bus is a standard rather than an automatic. Change gears to neutral before turning the ignition key.

, In most buses, you'll now need to push the starter button. However, with some engines, you'll need to wait about five minutes before you push the starter. For instance, if your engine is diesel and has an inlet heater or glow plugs, that means these parts need to warm up before the engine is started. There should be an indicator light that turns off when you can push the starter.

, Like cars, you should position your hands in a particular way for the best grip on the steering wheel. On the bus, the recommendation is at 9 and 3, meaning that if you imagine the steering wheel as a clock, your hands will be where the 9 and the 3 are. Another way of looking at is your hands should be in the center on either side of the wheel., If your bus is automatic, you don't need to worry about this method, but if it's a standard, you do. Start by establishing how many gear positions your bus has, usually four or five for driving forward, plus neutral and reverse.You should be able to find a diagram on your bus. If you can't, find someone more experienced to tell you about the gears on the bus.
Once someone shows you, you may want to make your own chart just in case you forget.

, Start by pressing your left foot down on the clutch, which is the pedal to the left of the brake. Next, place your right foot on the brake, and shift into second gear, which will be your starting gear.Next, undo the parking brake. Slowly lift your foot off the clutch until it reaches the friction point then stop. You'll know you've hit the friction point because the bus will start to move forward. Move your foot to the accelerator.
As you start to accelerate, release the clutch with your left foot, pushing further down on the accelerator with your right foot.

, As you drive and need to go faster, you'll need to shift up. The process is similar to how you shifted to put the bus in motion. Once again, if you are driving an automatic, you can skip this step.


Push the clutch in with your left foot. As you do, take your right foot off the accelerator.
Shift up into the next gear.
Next, take your foot off the clutch, and press down on the accelerator. You'll need to do this step a bit faster than when you started the bus moving.
Use the same method to shift down.

, Just like in a car, you can use one of two methods when turning the wheel. You either move hand over hand to turn the wheel or push with one hand and pull with the other without crossing over. Hand over hand can be a bit smoother, but if you're more comfortable with the push-pull method, it can be just as effective., If you try to slow down in the middle of a curve, it can be disastrous in a bus. You can cause the bus to skid, for instance. You may even lose control of the bus. Therefore, when approaching a curve, consider whether you will need to slow down, and do so before you hit the curve., That is, you need to give yourself as much space as you can to make the curve. Because of that, you need to move to the edge of the lane, giving you more space.For example, if the curve is going to the left, you'll be moving toward the right side of the lane.
If the curve is going to the right, you'll be moving towards the left side of the lane.

, This move is just like a car. That is, as you reach the middle of the curve, it's time to start accelerating again. Move back up to speed as you end the curve., While left turns are generally pretty easy, right turns can be more difficult, given the length of the bus. Approach an intersection as you would in a car, getting in the correct lane and slowing down.Do not swing out into the lane to your left, as you could swing into a car. Hug that side of the lane only.
If you must take extra space to make a turn, do so in the lanes that you're turning into. That is, as you turn right, you can swing out a little into the far lane next to your new lane if you need to, then return to the proper lane. Just be sure to watch for other vehicles and pedestrians., As you enter traffic, it's important to not rely solely on your mirrors if you can. Of course, your blind spots are in slightly different places on a bus. Once you put on your turn signal, wait a few seconds before merging, to give other drivers a chance to honk if you don't see them.When you're merging left, your blind spot is near the back of the bus on the left side.
Make sure you move your whole head and body to see around people to check out the back and sides and to see all you can in mirrors.
Before merging, make sure you have 1 1/2 bus lengths between you and the next vehicle.

, Most states have a law about school buses and train tracks. In other words, you must stop, open the door, and look to see if anything is coming on the tracks. Usually, you must take this precaution even if you have no passengers on the bus.


You'll need to turn on your hazard lights before breaking, as cars might not expect you to stop.
Stop close enough to get a clear view, but try not to stop within 15 feet or so.
Stay stopped if you see a train coming. Don't try to race the train. If you don't see a train, proceed across the tracks.

, Avoid backing up whenever possible, as it's always safest to go forward on a vehicle like a bus. However, when you must go backward, it's best to get someone to help you, if someone is around. Have them stand where you can see them, and then they can help guide you into place.


Before backing up, honk your horn. Also, turn on your hazards and the audible signal that indicates you're backing up.
Only back up in a straight line. Reverse the bus, and move back slowly until the person tells you to stop. If no one is around, use your mirrors to guide you.

, Remember that a bus is very heavy. It can weigh as much as 9 tons with no one even on it. With a full bus, it can weigh as much as 15 tons. That means that it's going to take you much longer to stop in a bus than it would in a car.Downshift to 4th gear when you've slowed below 30.
Press the clutch in as you are stopping. Slowly ease down on the break until you come to a complete stop.

, Find a suitable place to park. If you're pulling into a gas station, for instance, you should choose one built for trucks and buses, as some parking lots are not made for vehicles that large. Once you've found a place, put the bus in neutral.Unless your bus is turned uphill, turn your wheels to the right. If your bus is facing uphill, your wheels should be facing left.
Engage the parking brake, and turn the key to shut off the ignition. Always take the key out of the ignition.

Check the weather.,
Find a large open area.,
Wear safety equipment.,
Be careful when driving.,
Turn on the headlights.,
Have a supervisor.",How to Be Safe on a Dune Buggy," Some weather is unsuitable for driving, in particular rainy weather, because wet ground can cause a dune buggy to slip up. Check a weather forecast for the day you plan on driving, and check the sky when you get to your location.;
, The safest place to drive a dune buggy is in an are without many obstacles, particularly trees, that you can hit. Extremely dry areas are also a bad choice, because driving in such an area could bring up a lot of dust, and obscure the vision of the driver. If you don't own this land, you should get permission from the person who does before driving on it.

, A good, strong, well-fitting safety helmet should always be worn, and can be found at most sporting goods stores. If your dune buggy doesn't have a windshield, wear sunglasses to keep dust or other harmful items, such as stones, from hitting your eyes. Make sure that the buggy's safety harness is on you properly. You should loosen up the harness to get your arms through, and then tighten it to ensure you won't fly away in an accident.

, Make sure you are always driving at a safe speed. This does not necessarily mean that you cannot drive fast, but make sure your speed is reasonable enough as to keep control of the vehicle. Turning too fast can also be dangerous. When you are about to make a turn, ease up on the gas pedal, and begin to slowly turn the steering wheel in the direction you wish to go.

, Needless to say, when it starts to get dark, your eyes won't be as reliable as during daytime. Turning on the headlights at night is a smart move, in case there are any holes or rocks that you might have been driving around, or for spotting animals that come out during nighttime.

, Bring along a friend or family member who can help if there is an accident. It would be wise for the supervisor to have a cell phone. The supervisor should stand out of the way of the driver, while the driver should take care when driving in an area near the supervisor. The supervisor should also bring a flashlight if you stay until dark. You can take turns driving so no one is bored.

Avoid the back of the bus if possible, where the effects of turning and/or braking on your balance may be more pronounced.;
, Allow yourself more room to adjust your footing as needed without stepping on someone else or their belongings. Avoid being knocked off balance by someone else.


If space is limited onboard, stand near people who aren’t carrying any purses, bookbags, or other bulky items that may effect their balance and/or yours.

, Keep your center of gravity as low as possible.


If you prefer keeping your hands free for any reason (fear of germs, dirty surfaces, etc.), go ahead, but stake out a spot within easy reach of a handhold anyway. Keep at least one hand free (preferably the one closest to the handhold) so you can grab it quickly if you lose your balance. Also consider bringing a pair of gloves so you can maintain a firm grip for the duration of the ride.

Keep your rear foot perpendicular to the direction of travel.

, Stand with your weight on the toes and balls of your feet, ready to spring into action if needed. Keep your heels on the floor, but avoid settling all of your weight on them.

, Lower your center of gravity a bit more than usual. Allow your legs to absorb shock from bumpy travel before it can reach any farther upward.

, Static friction will keep your feet fixed to the floor,but your upper body may feel like it’s being pulled back as the bus moves forward. Lean into the direction of travel to compensate.

, Use your rear foot (the one perpendicular to the direction of travel) for lateral stability.

, Keep the other leg relatively straight. Inertia will propel your body forward when the bus slows down or stops.Either bend your forward knee to absorb your weight as it moves forward and use your toes to push your body backwards again, or bend your rear knee and lean backwards to keep your body relatively stable.

Be sure to ask the bus driver's helper if that bus is going where you expect it to. They don't always. The second way to catch a bus is to simply stand on the side of the road and wave one down. If they aren't full they will stop and pick you up. If they are full they will keep going, don't give up, you'll eventually find one that will stop.;
, Every passenger who gets on will do this, it's expected. In Panama the correct greeting is ""Buenas"".  You will get a collective Buenas back from the passengers already seated on the bus.

, If you cannot find a seat go up front and the driver's helper will give you the jump seat in front of the entrance to the bus. Be prepared to get up and down as people enter and leave the bus. When more people leave then get on go find a seat in the back.

, His helper takes it later in the trip. Usually shortly before you arrive at your destination. And the amount it costs can vary. A trip from Coronado to Albrook in Panama City can cost anywhere from $2.00-$3.25, it all depends on the assistant. Don't argue about the cost if it's changed from the last time you rode, just pay.

The cost to pass is .10 cents. You can use one card for multiple people traveling together. Once you've purchased your metro card you need to purchase your actual ticket. Find the window with the name of the city you are traveling to. There will hopefully be a ticket agent there (there isn't always), and you can buy the ticket at the window.

, Do not match the number on your ticket to the ones by the buses, they do not match. Instead, follow the ticket agent, he is the bus driver's assistant for the trip. When you get on the bus say ""Buenas"" to everyone again and find a seat. Hold on to your ticket because it won't be collected until you are almost at your destination. And be sure to let the assistant know where you will be exiting so he can remind the bus driver, otherwise you will end up going on a longer trip then you planned initially. Don't be embarrassed if that happens, you are not the first one to do it, and you'll remember for your next bus ride.

Find out which route is the one that will take you where you need to go.,
Know whether or not you need to have correct cash, a ticket, or any other payment method.,
Be aware of the difference between express and all stops buses.,
Know where to get on the bus.,
Know if you can carry large objects with you.,
Find out about disabled access.,
Be prepared to stand.,
Look for the way to alert the driver that you need to get off.,
Thank the bus driver as you get off.,
Take care getting off the bus.",How to Catch a Bus," In some cases it may mean catching more than one bus. Finding out which bus to catch can include:



Researching online to find the routes. Many bus companies now include complete maps with route markers on them. Some will also show connections.
Phoning the bus company and asking for advice.
Going to a public information counter and asking for advice.
Visiting a tourist center and getting advice on bus routes and timetables.;
, Many bus services now require accurate change, or at least coins so that the bus driver does not have to give change. Others do not mind giving change and some even have conductors to take care of this, such as London buses (you can't use cash on London buses). If you need to have a ticket in advance, you will have to work out where to purchase this from; it may be a ticket booth or an automatic vending machine. Again, ask about this when seeking the information in step one.

, Some buses are express, meaning they don't stop at all stops and might go right past the stop you want; if you are not sure, ask as you get on and be prepared to hop off and wait for another one.

, Depending on the type of bus and where you live in the world, the front door is not always the only, or even right, way on the bus. Some buses allow entrance via the middle doors, or the back. It can be of especial importance during crowded peak hour times to know that you can squeeze in through a different door.

, Some buses can take your bike. Don't assume this is possible though; always check beforehand. Also, put large parcels, suitcases etc. in an appropriate place after getting on a bus. Buses that go to airports and railways often have large case areas. Other buses will often have a smaller place for school packs and briefcases. And always remove your pack or large back from your back and carry before getting on. There is nothing more unpleasant than being clobbered in the face by a school bag on a student's back. Be thoughtful and considerate of others.

, If you have any difficulties using a bus, you might need to get a bus able to provide disabled access. Some buses are able to ""kneel"" to let on wheelchair. However, in many places, these buses are only assured at certain times of the day and you will need to find out about these in advance.

, Buses are a popular form of transport and often there is standing room only. If you have a genuine reason to sit when everyone else is already seated, be ready to ask people politely if someone is willing to stand up because you are ""sick/disabled/pregnant/exhausted etc."". And be prepared for some people to be a little rude but persevere. Usually one person will feel guilty enough to give up their seat in this situation; this is why it is important not to single out one person but to address a group of seated people instead.

, Most buses have buttons or pull cords that ring a bell and alert the driver that somebody wants to get off at the next stop. If you can't reach it, ask for help from a passenger nearer to the bell or cord. And the best thing ever is to let the bus driver know in advance where you need to get off if this is your first time and you are unfamiliar with the route. That way, he or she will stop without you having to worry.

, It is really important to acknowledge the driver's care in getting you to where you want to go. A civil society that says thank you is a pleasant one to live in. It is especially important to say thank you when you catch the bus regularly and you get to know the driver well.

, Always wait until the bus is clear of the bus stop before trying to cross the ride; you can't see what is coming up alongside a parked bus and walking in front of a bus is just not a good idea. Be patient, or better still, walk to the lights to cross the road after alighting the bus.

Plan!,
If you want to buy your ticket on the day of travel leave enough spare time to allow for queuing at the ticket office.,
Arrive early onto the train's platform.,
Ask staff or look at the departure boards to see which platform your train will leave from.,
Get on the train!,
Relax.,
Get off the train.,
Look out for seats for disabled travellers.",How to Travel by Train," If you know the date and time of your journey 2 weeks or so in advance, go to a local station or onto a rail website and book your ticket early. This could save you money or get you a reserved seat on a busy service.


Pack all of your luggage so that you can quick grab it to take it with you. Make sure that you can quickly grab those things that you might need to put in at the last available second.
Make sure to have a good breakfast. Not all trains include food and drink cars.;
, Chances are you'll experience a horrible feeling of panic if you see your train about to leave and you haven't got your ticket!

, Sometimes, the compartments are not sorted correctly and you might have to search for your train car. It is easier to do this from the platform than fighting through a crowded train., Follow signs to get to the platform and listen to the loudspeaker system for possible platform alterations. Bear in mind you might have to go up and down stairs, look for a lift if stairs aren't an option for you.

, Put your luggage in the overhead racks rather than on the seat next to you as you may stop someone else sitting down. Just think how annoyed you'd be if you needed a seat and someone else was using up a perfectly good one for their bag or feet.

, Now you have your seat you are in a good place to forget about everything and just be transported to your destination. It is a good idea to pay attention to the announcements so you have an idea of how many stops there are until you get off or if you are approaching your destination. But don't worry too much about whereabouts you are as it is usually announced when your stop is coming up. If there are no announcements ask the conductor for the time when the train is expected to arrive.

, If you have lots of luggage try to get it all together and stand near the door ready to get off the train. If you didn't hear the announcement ask someone nearby which stop you are approaching so you don't get off at the wrong place! Remember to press the buttons near the doors to open them. They won't open on their own.

, When a train is full people tend to sit in these seats. If a disabled person, or a pregnant women gets on, it is customary for those people in these seats to offer to get up.

Try to understand the Acela train route.,
Obtain a schedule of train departures and arrivals to see when and exactly where which Acela train will stop at the designated station.,
Purchase a seat from the Amtrak website, via the Self Service kiosk or from another official Amtrak-approved method.,
Pick up your tickets a few days before the trip (if you haven't already thought about that differently).,
Board your train when the station board says that your train is ""Now Boarding"" for that train number.

,
Be prepared to hand your Acela ticket to the Amtrak attendant who will come around to collect them.",How to Take a Ride on the Amtrak Acela Train," The Acela train travels over the same route as that of the Northeast Corridor's route (from Boston's South Station to Washington's Union Station) making some major stops in cities between these stations from Boston, MA to Washington, DC including some major stops in New York (NY), Philadelphia(PA), Wilmington (DE), Baltimore (MD) and leading up to Washington (DC). Though there are multiple lines running through and around the path where the Acela runs, there is only one single line to and from the places that the Acela will run on.

Understand some of the other intended stops. It does make a few other stops on the line, and especially from the point of New York and points south, if it stops at one point, it won't stop at the other (look at a timetable of Acela trains and watch these differences are affected). Although it has stops in Newark (never at Newark International Airport) and Metropark, NJ, if it stops at one station, it definitely won't stop at the other.
It also takes up a few stops in Southern Massachusetts (not nearby Cape Cod), and Rhode Island, and Connecticut. It does make a stop or two in the tip of Southern Westchester County (New Rochelle as being one of its biggest stops in New York).;
, Although most often times the Acela will have a train coming through about once every hour, due to seasonal changes and other track maintenance/work and other unintended delays, its time schedule can be delayed at times.


Realize that the train may be stopped for up to one hour in New York, NY (Penn Station), as this stop is it's largest and most regularly-boarded stop on the route. It will take them awhile to debunk passengers as well as collect new passengers who are boarding, then they wait until the rest of the nearby track is clear (near the Hudson River crossing into New Jersey) and then take off again; all a process of about the hours wait. However, don't dilly-dally around when they say your train is ""now boarding"" from the timetable board.

, Obtain some money to pay for the intended trip. It's best to pay for an Acela trip as soon as those days are available to be seen directly from Amtrak's website, as fares for those days are always cheaper, and will always cost more as the trip-date nears. For a trip from New York to Washington, most Acela trains will run you $200-$300 from your pocket (and even more if you request to be upgraded to First Class/Business).


, Be sure to print out your Amtrak ""receipt"" and scan it into the self-service TripTicket kiosk, or if the nearby stationmaster is able to assist you, most stations will be able to print you out your tickets from that specific itinerary. If purchased from the Amtrak mobile app or from the Amtrak website, you can also have your tickets forwarded right to your virtual wallet on your phone.

,, If you purchased a digital ticket that can be displayed on the phone, make sure the pass is open in the virtual wallet on your phone so that the scanning experience for the train engineer is seamless.

Consider getting travel insurance.",How to Take a Solo Train Journey1," Avoid bringing several large, heavy bags with you when you’re traveling solo. Hauling them around can be exhausting and may slow you down. You want to remain as mobile as possible and be able to move quickly whenever necessary. Bring a moderately sized carry-on bag that is easy for you to move with.


Bringing lots of luggage could also make you a possible target for theft.
If your train journey is for a full day or longer, bringing a carry-on allows you to access your things quickly and keep everything in one place.Since the single occupancy rooms on trains are usually very small, so you won’t have room for tons of luggage or possessions anyway.;
, Keep this information on you at all times. Being able to reference your itinerary quickly and easily can be very helpful when traveling alone. Include the phone numbers of any hotels you might stay in, the name and contact information for anyone you plan to meet and an emergency contact for yourself.


If applicable, include the phone number to the nearest U.S. Embassy (or your native country's embassy).Give someone you trust a copy of your itinerary before you leave, just in case.

, Try to keep some cash and a credit card on your person at all times. Put the rest in your carry-on, backpack or purse. If anything happens to one or the other in the middle of your journey, you won’t be left penniless. Consider using empty vitamin bottles to store rolled up cash in, as well.


Throw a few old, loose pills into the bottles with the cash, so that they rattle when shaken.
Stash these in your backpack or carry-on. No one will be interested in stealing bottles of your vitamins.

, This is especially true if you plan to be carrying valuables on your journey. Most railways offer relatively affordable travel insurance to their passengers – check with the railway you plan to use for insurance options. If you are planning to bring valuables with you, you might want to put them in a small bag that you keep on your person at all times.This way you can avoid stress by always knowing where the valuables are.

Bring plenty of entertainment with you.,
Pack snacks and other supplies in your carry-on.Trains do provide dining options for passengers and these options are usually very affordable.,
Take plenty of disposable pre-moistened body wipes with you.",How to Take a Solo Train Journey2," Bring a few books and your iPod with you on your train journey. Grab a decking of playing cards, as well – there will be plenty of opportunities to mingle with your fellow travelers on the train and a game of cards can help break the ice and get everyone chatting. It’s good to keep busy during a long journey, but don’t forget to look out of your window and watch the scenery go by.


The scenery is one of the perks of train travel! You will no doubt pass through beautiful and interesting landscapes.Don’t forget to bring external chargers for your smartphone, iPod and other gadgets.

, However, the menu will probably be quite limited and not necessarily very healthy, either. Pack some non-perishable snacks like granola bars, crackers, trail mix, peanut butter, dried fruit, nuts and so on. You can keep your energy up, save money and eat more healthily by doing so.


Beverages will be available on the train, but these must be purchased. Keep several bottles of waters with you to keep you hydrated.

, There is typically one bathroom in each train carriage, which everyone on that particular car has to share. Unless you bought a first class ticket, you probably won’t have access to a shower. Because of these reasons, bringing pre-moistened body wipes can make it much easier for you to freshen up during your journey.For ease of use, look for travel wipes that are sold in resealable packages.
Try to buy wipes that are alcohol-free – especially if you have sensitive skin.

Schedule regular check-ins with someone back home.,
Stay alert.,
Think twice about accepting food or drinks from strangers.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Take a Solo Train Journey3," As a precaution, speak to a friend or family member about periodic check-ins during your journey. Since you’re travelling solo, it’s important to have someone back home aware of where you are and how things are going, just in case something happens. You can do this via Skype, email or any other communication platform you prefer.For example, you could let them know to expect an email from you every two days and a Skype session once per week.
Come up with a plan for how they should proceed if you miss one or more scheduled check-ins.

, Avoid taking heavy sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medication when you’re travelling alone. Unfortunately, you can be robbed (or worse) if you make yourself vulnerable in this way. If you find yourself unable to sleep or feeling stressed out, try to do some simple deep breathing exercises to calm down. Inhale slowly through your nose as you count to five. Then exhale slowly through your mouth as you count to five.Take the medication if you absolutely need it, but take the smallest effective dose that you can. Make sure none of the other passengers see you taking this kind of medication, just to be safe.
Many trains offer alcoholic beverages, but it’s unwise and unsafe to get intoxicated on a train by yourself.

, Unfortunately, drugging is always possibility and travelling solo puts you at slightly higher risk. For your own safety, always evaluate everything that you’re offered. Look closely for evidence of food tampering and discreetly smell beverages for unusual odors. Trust your gut – if something feels off about a situation, smile and politely decline the food or beverage being offered to you.


It’s better to err on the side of caution and you definitely don’t want to wake up with all of your belongings missing.You’ll probably be sharing meals with the other passengers in a common area of the car, so drugging is not outside the realm of possibility., Scan a copy of your passport, ID and any other important documents before you leave. Email these scans to yourself or upload the documents to a locked site like DropBox, which you can easily access from any computer. If anything is stolen from you or if anything else happens on your journey, you will still be able to access these important items."

Go out to an open area.,
Start the bike with the kick starter on the right side, beside your right leg.

,
Always let your bike warm up before riding to prevent damage to your engine.

,
When ready, pull in the clutch all the way, then on the left side, push down on the shifter to put the bike into first gear.

,
Gently give the bike gas while letting the clutch out slowly.,
To put the bike in neutral when the bike is not on, depending on the bike, shift down until it is in first then lightly click up a gear.",How to Use a Clutch on a Dirtbike,";
,,,, When you need to shift gears, it is up to you to use the clutch to shift up or down. However not using it will tear up your gears.

, If it rolls forward without stopping then it is in neutral. For bikes with only 3 gears neutral is always the lowest gear. To be sure, tap down about 5 or six times.

If you're riding along and encounter anything boggy, don't slam on the brakes and turn around.. quitters do that.. how are you going to know what""s on the other side of the bog if you don't go through it?..

,
If a bog , look for the most shallow , straight rut .,
The second you hit the bog you'll lose some speed which is why you must stay on the throttle .,
Try to keep your feet on the pegs and weight back all the way through .,
For advanced riders : Look for a rock , hump or small log in advance of the bog .,
Ruts don't matter unless they are over hardpack.,
If the bike has adjustable fork compression settings , add one or two more clicks compression resistance to help prevent plowing and to help keep the bike level in whoops .,
Its OK to use light clutch in turns and a little wheel spin is O.K.,
Stay loose , breathe regularly and let the bike traverse side to side as it hunts though the ruts on straightaways .,
If the front wheel plows abruptly you may crash but often its saved by muscling it somewhat straight and adding more throttle simultaneously .,
If you ride in sand a lot and not on paved rods or hard pack , try a paddle tire on the rear .,
Sand riding is great fun once you learn how to do it .

",How to Ride a Dirt Bike Through Sand,", Maintain speed and keep your butt as far toward the rear of the seat as you are comfortable while standing up in the attack/crouched stance . Roll on a little more throttle just before the bog .

, NEVER shift down or dump the clutch as this will tend to dig in the bog .Ideally have the throttle from 50-75 % not wide open.

, Dabbing one foot down or dog paddling is OK if you have to , but chances of getting stuck go way up and its not a fast way through .

, Gas it hard right up to the aberration , bounce on the pegs to get the most spring off the aberration . Keep the bike level and clear the bog in the air . Gas it a micro second before the rear wheel hits the ground .

, In more typical sandy conditions , stay on the gas everywhere . Drive harder into turns carrying more momentum . Think of sand as a dragging front brake.;
, Leave the rebound damping as is .

, Forget using the front brake in sand . If overshooting a turn , drag the rear brake a bit and stay on the gas , even if you only apply 20-30 % throttle .

, Stay on the gas . If there are a lot of whoops try to get enough momentum to shift up a gear higher . This keeps the rear suspension less loaded so it can work better and it will tend to make the bike get on top of the sand . Stay on the gas always . Even if you drag the rear brake in whoop or out of crash fear .

, If you crash , don't emphasize catching yourself . Try to roll your body even before you hit the ground .

, Traction will be very good , much easier to keep the front end light and the whole bike more on top of the sand .

Take off: Start the bike, compress the clutch and then push the shift lever downwards ( most bikes shift pattern is Down for first, and up for the following gears );
,
Once the bike is in gear, very slowly let the clutch out while applying throttle at an equal rate.,
To shift to second, pull in the clutch lever, at the same time release the throttle.,
Once in the next gear, let off the clutch and apply throttle, in sync with the clutching.,
To shift down, ease off the throttle until your speed is roughly equal to the higher end speed of the lower gear.

,
Compress the clutch while letting off the throttle, shift down, then let the clutch out while applying little throttle.,
Hit neutral: In a bike with a shift pattern that is Down, Up, Up, you will need to get to first gear, and then raise the shift lever halfway between first and second.",How to Use the Clutch on a Motocross Bike,", This is often the hardest part for beginners. If the engine RPM suddenly drops, that either means you are not giving enough throttle, or you are releasing the clutch too rapidly, or perhaps both. Once in first gear and moving, shifting to the next gears is much easier.

, Doing so in sync will keep the engine RPM from spiking. Lift the shifter lever until there is a firm click into the next gear.

, You may then accelerate and shift into the next gear using the same process.

,, You will be in the top end of the gear most likely, and applying too much throttle will cause your RPM to spike.

, This is often hard to do for beginners. An easy way to hit neutral on most bikes is to shift to neutral while still moving.

Check for obstructions.,
Board the loco.,
Open the firebox doors.,
Climb onto the running plate of the locomotive above the front (buffer) beam.,
Climb back into the cab and start a fire in the firebox.,
Check the fire after a few minutes.,Wait until the fire has spread so the water in the boiler begins to boil, add coal on top of the wood, first in single lumps, and later when pressure has begun to build up, in shovelfuls.,
Perform a blowdown.,
Fill the boiler to 3/4 of a gauge glass at 1/2 working pressure, both injectors should be tested.,
Know that permission should be sought from the driver and shunter before uncoupling.,
Disposal.,
When on shed, the driver will position the locomotive over an ash pit, adjacent to an ash bin.",How to Fire a Steam Locomotive," First thing in the morning, the locomotive will be ""cold"", which means that the fire has already been dropped and the locomotive has cooled off. Before climbing into the loco's cab, check that there are no obstructions behind, between or in front of any of the wheels. Check the sandboxes are full and free from obstructions (a gentle tap on the feed pipe will ensure the sand will flow freely).
, Once on the footplate, check that the water gauge glass(es) are full. Open and close the lower lever on the glass to check that it refills when empty, and therefore is not giving a false reading. Opening the lower lever will empty the glass, and closing it should enable a good view on how much water is in the boiler. If the glasses are empty and do not refill, bung up the overflow pipes outside the cab and turn on the water injector(s). This will fill the boiler with water. When satisfied that the glass is at least half full of water, check that the brakes are applied, the regulator is shut, the reversing lever is in mid-gear (pointing up), the cylinder drain cocks are open, and that the tender or bunker has sufficient coal to light up a fire., Shine a torch/flashlight directly onto the fire bars. There should be no clinker (melted material) covering them, and the ash should be removed as well as possible. Also check that there is no damp patch or water dripping onto the bars. If there is, you must 'fail' the loco and cancel your service. Next, look upwards to the centre of the roof of the box. The fusible plug should be visible, intact, and not leaking water. If it is at all damaged or leaking at all, then 'fail' the loco. Check the tube-plate at the front of the box. It should be free of debris and ash, and not leaking., Open the smokebox door. On the majority of British steam locomotives, this involves turning the forward-most handle on the smokebox 90° to a horizontal position, then unscrewing the next handle while keeping the first handle in a horizontal position. The majority of North American locomotives utilize screw-locked hinges to keep the door in place. These are just generalizations based on average well-known practices. As so, methods on opening smokebox doors may vary between locomotives, countries, and locomotive builders. Empty the smokebox of any ash, and sweep ash away from the blower and regulator. Check that the tube-plate is clear of debris and is not leaking. Ensure the crossbar is inserted correctly. Close and lock the smokebox door by undoing what you did to unlock and open it., General locomotive fire starting is as follows:

Cover the fire grate with a layer of coal that's one lump thick.
Place kindling wood in the center of the grate.
Place a large rag on the coal shovel and drench the rag with paraffin, petrol, or lubrication oil.
Light in two to three places and allow to burn outside the firebox until burning well.
Place the now on-fire rag on the kindling in the firebox and immediately shut the firebox doors.

, If it is burning poorly or has died out, light another rag, this time using more flammable fluid. If the fire is burning well, you can add larger pieces of wood, piling them up in a pyramid formation in the box, with the tip of the pyramid above the fire. When the wood begins to crackle, be very cautious when opening the firebox doors, as the fire is likely to blow back into the cab, or release toxic fumes. Stand well back and open the blower valve a little. Continue to add wood as the fire grows.,, At 1/3 working pressure, perform a blowdown by opening the blowdown valve. Ensure that either the pit is clear of ash or that the locomotive is clear of the pit, to avoid blowing ash into the motion. A blowdown should always be performed at the driver's discretion.,

When moving off shed, the cylinder drain cocks should be left open for 5-10 mins to remove water that will have condensed in the cylinders overnight.
During the day, the duty of the fireman is to retain working pressure, and even firebed and preferably 3/4 of a gauge glass of water. Route knowledge is essential, and more pressure should be made when tackling long gradients. Avoid using injectors when standing in the platform or in tunnels, to avoid the danger of injuring passengers or railway workers. Avoid blowing off at all times, especially when standing in the station, as this wastes steam. When the fireman is not occupied with his/her fire, he/she should be looking out at the trackbed, watching for obstructions, trespassers, signals, and other hazards.

, When uncoupling, be aware of hazards such as buffers, other trains and injector overflow. The vacuum or air brake bags should be disconnected first, as this applies the brakes of the engine and rolling stock, and ensures protection against either moving by accident. Next, steam heating pipes (if used) should be disconnected. Always shut off the steam heating valves on both engine and coach before disconnecting, as serious burns can occur through carelessness. Next, unscrew the screw coupling and lift the eye of the coupling off the stock and onto the engine. When coupling on, preform this sequence in reverse, i.e. Coupling first (which should be screwed as tightly as possible, with the weight pointing downwards), then steam heating (if used), then brakes. When coupling or uncoupling, always strive to go between vehicles on the track side rather than platform side of the rake, and always reemerge on the same side as you went under., At the end of the day, a locomotive must be disposed of. an hour or so before disposal, attempt to 'run down' the fire as much as possible, that is, do not feed it as frequently or as heavily, and on the run back to the shed, begin to rake the fire through the firebars using a pricker or dart. By running either of these instruments over the firebars, the fire can be encouraged to fall through the grate into the ashpan. Doing this prior to shedding the engine will save time when disposing., If the fire has been raked through as much as possible, it will be necessary to dispose of large pieces of clinker and burnt coal into the ash bin. A specialized fire shovel may be used for this purpose, and care must be taken to clear the back of the firebox (behind the doors) as well as the front. When you have satisfied yourself that the box is empty, and the firebars are free of clinker and coal, you must attend to the ash pan.

The ash pan is normally accessed by opening the back damper of the locomotive, and climbing into the pit. You should be able to look directly into the ashpan. An ash pan hose should be attached to one injector overflow, and the water valve turned on. This will allow you to damp down the ash in the ash pan, and prevent small particles of ash from entering the motion, where it would quickly cause wear. Use a firing iron to remove the sodden ash from the ash pan, and allow it to fall into the pit. Clear the smokebox as detailed in Step 4.

Have caution when you take off.,
Shift from first to second gear.,
Remember that shifting down is the same rules as shifting up.,
Learn how to correctly slow down and come to a complete stop.,
Know how to maneuver around corners.,
Practice on rough terrain.",How to Ride a Dirt Bike (the Basics)," A two-stroke engine means that two strokes are required to complete a full cycle. The first stroke is to admit and compress an air-fuel mixture; the second stroke is to ignite the fuel, do the work, and scavenge the cylinder. The term scavenge means to force out/remove burnt gases from the cylinder. Two-stroke engines require an oil and gas mixture, and they tend to be noisier and more powerful than four-strokes. A four-stroke engine means that a complete cycle in each cylinder requires four strokes. The first stroke is to draw in the air-fuel mixture, second to compress it, third to ignite it and do the work, and the fourth is to scavenge the cylinder. Unlike two-strokes, four-strokes have two separate tanks, one for the oil and one for gas. Again, four-strokes tend to be quieter and not as powerful. For beginners, it's recommended to get a 125cc four-stroke or a 50cc two-stroke.;
, Prior to riding, make sure you know where the clutch, throttle, gear shifter, back brakes, front brakes, and choke are.


When you're sitting on your dirt bike, make sure that you're closer to the front than the back. Before taking off, make sure the bike is in neutral. Neutral is below two and slightly above one. (Some bikes could be different) Kick the gear shifter down all the way, and then lightly kick it up into neutral. Rock the bike back and forth; if it moves freely without locking up you're in neutral.






When you have the bike in neutral, then you can kick-start it. Kick starting can be difficult for some, but is extremely easy once you know how to do it. In order to kick-start, place your foot on the starter, then give a little jump and push down hard.






Once you have the bike going, pull in the clutch, and kick the gear shifter down into first. You'll know you're in first gear because the bike will lurch forward a bit. (Again, this depends on the bike.)Make sure you don't let go of the clutch if you're not moving because you'll stall the bike.

, With the bike in first, you want to slowly let off on the clutch and give it a bit of gas. When you get moving, let go of the clutch completely. Don't worry if you stall the bike a couple times. Eventually, you'll get use to how much throttle you need give and how far to let up on the clutch to get rolling.

, When the bike is not moving any faster and you can hear the engine revving at its highest, let off on the gas a bit, pull in the clutch, and kick the shifter up into second. When you've shifted gears, let off on the clutch and twist the throttle. (Note: You don't have to slowly let off the clutch and slowly give it gas like you're required to do when shifting from neutral to first). Do the same thing when you're shifting up, into higher gears.

, Let up on the gas, pull in the clutch, and kick the shifter down. NEVER keep on the gas when shifting; doing so is refereed to as ""power-shifting"" which could end up damaging your transmission. Sometimes the bike could fall into neutral instead of first. You'll know because the bike will slow, start coasting, and giving it throttle will not do anything. When this happens, pull in the clutch, and kick the shifter down into first.

,

If you want to slow down on a dirt bike, shift down, let off on the throttle, and either brake using the front brakes, back brakes, or a combination of both.






If you're coming to an almost complete stop or just stopping, shift into first, pull in and hold the clutch, and brake; this will prevent you from stalling the bike. When you're ready to start rolling again, slowly let off on the clutch and give it a bit of gas.

, When you're headed for a corner, lean into it, pick your line, and keep your weight on the outside peg. To prevent yourself from losing control of the bike, pick a line in which you wish to travel and stick to it. Apply pressure to the outside peg; this will help give you more traction. Rounding corners, your outside elbow should be slanted up and your inner leg should be slanted out. Stick out your inner leg, near the fender; if you end up losing control or take the corner to sharp, you can easily put your foot down to steady yourself out.

, Dirt bikes are meant to drive over rough terrain, with their lifted frames. Depending on where you are riding, you should be standing 95% of the time. When you’re riding over whoops or bumps in the ground, your arms and legs act as an extra shock absorber, so the impact isn't as hard.

Begin by making sure there is gas in the gas tank.,
After filling the tank with gas, turn the gas gauge on.

,
Before starting the engine, ensure the bike is in neutral.,
Once in neutral, hold in the clutch with your left hand and give a little bit of throttle with your right.,
Kick down on the kick start hard enough to turn over the engine and start the bike.

,
Once the bike is running, let it run for a few minutes to warm up the engine.

,
Once the engine is warmed up, hold in the clutch and press down once with your toe on the toe gear to put the bike into first gear.

,
Slowly release the clutch with your left hand as you increase the throttle with your right.,
Once in first gear, fully let go of the throttle, rev the engine with your right hand until at full throttle, when you want to go faster and change into second gear, let off the throttle, hold in the clutch and press up once on the toe gear.,
Continue to shift up through the gears, the higher the gear, the faster you will be able to go.,
Once you are finished riding for the time being, Down shift all the way to first gear, then into neutral.","How to Ride a Manual, 6 Speed Dirt Bike"," (Depending on the type of bike and if it is a 2 stroke engine or 4 stroke engine you will either need straight gas or a gas/oil mixture.);
,, (Press down on the toe shifter 5 or 6 times and the once up. If the bike is in neutral it will be able to roll forward and backward.)

, (Only rev the throttle a small amount so you don't over rev your engine.)

,,,, (Getting into first and get moving is the hardest part, you may stall the bike once or twice before you get the hang of it.)

, (You will still be moving so it will be much easier to release the clutch without stalling the bike.)

, If you intend to slow down you must down shift. (Shifting down back through the gears, this will ensure you are not going to slow in too high of gear or else you will stall the bike. Being in a lower gear gives you more torque and is easier to go up hills however being in a higher gear allows more horsepower and higher speeds.)

, Hold in the clutch and press the kill/off switch. Turn off the gas gauge and put the bike on its kickstand.

Put on a helmet.,
Make sure you have proper positioning.,
Get acquainted with the ""feel"" of the ride.,
As you are riding, without moving your head or eyes, determine if you can see your front fender using your peripheral vision.,
Master acceleration.,
Make smooth and quick shifts.,
Brake properly.,
At first, simply accelerate to 3rd or 4th gear and then brake to a stop.,
Try to “feel” when a tire is about to lock up.,
Remember how the condition of the trail affects accelerating and braking.",How to Ride Your First Dirt Bike," Other safety gear may be considered optional, such as boots, gloves, and various pads, but especially for inexperienced riders, a helmet should be worn at all times.;
, You can check this by sitting on the bike. If you’ve chosen the right size bike, your feet should just be able to touch the ground. Now, look at where you are on the seat. If you are like most beginners, you will be way too far back. You need to keep repeating this mantra while riding… “move forward, move forward, move forward”.


A dirt bike seat has a natural indentation where the seat meets the gas tank. That is where you want your butt… don’t worry, you can’t go too far forward because of the gas tank. It is very important ton the bike as you would a chair or a “cruiser” type motorcycle.






Put both feet on the pegs for your feet and try to stand up without pulling on the handlebars. If you are sitting over your feet like you should be, then this will be easy. If you are too far behind your feet, you will need to slide forward and pull on the handlebars.







, Now that you are seated properly, put the bike in first gear by clicking down the gear stick four times. now that you are in first gear twist the throttle gently until you began to move. The goal of this first ride is to get acquainted with the feel of a dirt bike as it goes over the dirt. If you are used to a street bike, riding a dirt bike will be a bit disconcerting at first because the ground is irregular and the bike will “wiggle” a bit underneath you. That is normal. As a beginner rider, you will most likely be “wiggling” around even more because you will be going so slow. As you progress to higher speeds, you will see that your front wheel will “float” a little more, rather than following each little turn in the dirt. Whether you are on a trail or in a field, just go back and forth for about 20 minutes. Each time, try to go a little bit faster until you feel the bike start to not feel so “wiggly”.

, If you can, you are probably looking too close to the front of the bike.

, When you accelerate, the natural forces will try to push you backward. Most beginners are sitting too far back on the seat and counter this force by pulling on the handlebars, which is exactly what you don't want to do. If you are seated properly, your hips should be over the foot pegs (or in front of them) and your upper body should have a forward lean to it. In this position, you can counter the rearward forces by pressing down and back on the footpegs, as well as leaning further forward. If you are doing it properly, you should be able to remove your left hand from the handlebar while accelerating and the bike should continue to track straight.

, Even though there are 3 items involved (throttle, clutch, and shifter), they are not 3 independent motions. Ultimately, it will become all one motion, meaning you will simultaneously shut the throttle, pull in the clutch and pick up on the shifter. Likewise, after the new gear is selected, you simultaneously let the clutch out as you open the throttle. Work on this until you can smoothly and quickly go through at least 3 gears.

, The same way that accelerating forces push you backward, braking forces will push you forward. Once again, the trick is to not transmit these forces to the handlebars. If you do, you not only make it more difficult to use the handlebar controls, but you have a tendency to stiffen up your arms, which in turn makes it harder to absorb bumps. If you are seated properly when braking, the gas tank should be between your thighs. As you begin braking, squeeze the gas tank with your legs. This will keep your body in the right position.

, Remember, as you are braking you should be downshifting so that when you stop, you will be able to immediately take off again.

, If you do, don’t increase brake pressure any more. Ideally, you want to be right at that point, where maximum pressure is applied but the tire is not skidding.

, For instance, if it is real bumpy, you cannot brake as hard before you start to skid. You have a choice to hold the clutch when you stop. You do not have to.

Get a dirt bike.,
Whoops can be tricky and require lots of practice as all other things do.",How to Ride a Dirt Bike," Avoid borrowing one from a friend, because as a first-time rider you risk damaging someone else's property. A two stroke would not be great for your first bike, they are much harder to control as the power band can kick in and give too much power when you least expect it. You will fall off a 2 stroke quickly and could be deterred from learning.Fourstrokes are easy and fun to ride, and have great power. Make sure you get a bike that is the right size for you because you don't want something too big that you can't handle-your dealer or whoever you are buying from will help you with that. I would suggest a 100-250cc older,cheaper bike, its preferable to dropping an expensive brand new bike. It all depends on your height and weight.Just sit on some bikes in the store and you will feel what is most comfortable for you. Talk to your local dealer for more information but do not buy right away. Some dealers might lie or scam you for more than you're worth! Always do research first.


Speed: When you are riding down a nice straightaway and you feel like goosing it, try to start in a low gear. Work that gear to its full potential, and then shift up (if you have an automatic bike, don't worry about this). Once you get up to your speed, slant your back at a 45 degree angle, bend your arms at a 90 degree angle and stand up. When standing up your legs and arms act as additional suspension when going over bumps. This keeps you in better control and will conserve energy.
Turning: The trick to getting maximum speed and the best setup in a turn is control. When coming into a turn, pick a good line that isn't going to run you off the track. Stick with it and keep steady power. Keep your outside elbow up and your inside leg out. Have your leg sticking straight out in front of you by the fender. This will help you keep your balance, and you can dab your foot on the ground if you slide out. Once in the turn, look where you want to go. Also keep your butt on the outside of the seat and apply a little pressure to the outside foot peg, this helps put more weight on the outside of your bike, giving you more traction. Remember to finish your braking and shifting before you enter the corner so you can concentrate all of your attention on getting through it. Sometimes using the clutch while exiting a corner will give you a short burst of power.
Jumps: Hitting big jumps can be scary if you are not comfortable with your riding ability yet. Try little table tops at first; they are very easy and provide a steady landing almost everywhere. Lift up your handlebars and stand up a little. Once you get skilled with that, try a double. Take off the bottom of the face sitting down. By the time your front wheel is off the dirt you should be standing up. Once in the air, position yourself comfortably but sturdily for a landing. If your front end is straight up and down, don't panic! Hit the back brake and it should lower gradually. Before you hit the ground, give a little gas so your bike will flow smoothly.;
, There are 3 main ways of hitting them: going slow and steady, doubling or tripling them (this can be very useful in a very technical track because you can get into a new line every time), or just blazing through them (very fast and hard to master; your back wheel skims over the tip of the whoops giving you less control). Stand up over whoops and keep your weight just behind the center of balance towards the back of the bike. Practice keeping your knees and elbows bent before you go crazy on them. More than 60 percent of all crashes on a track happen on the whoops. Hold on tight and flow with them. Don't freak out and overcorrect if you get into a wobbly state. Just ride it out.

Watch for your stop.,
Stand to the side and watch the gleaming animal that is/was your train pull quickly away.,
Write to your Congressman/woman and urge them to continue to support Amtrak.",How to Catch an Amtrak Train," Often, you can look at Amtrak to locate stations.;
, Because Amtrak does not travel at 450 mph (720 km/h), like airlines, it may take a few days to get where you are going. Make sure to take this into consideration.

, Tickets can be purchased 3 ways: through Amtrak, by calling Amtrak directly (1-800-USA-RAIL, 1-800-872-7245), or at the station from an agent. Not all stations are fully staffed, however, so an agent may not be an option in your area. Also, it is recommended to purchase your tickets at least 3 days in advance to assure availability. Amtrak's popularity is on the upswing, and some trains sell out quickly.

, If you are going on a longer trip, you may want to pack an extra bag that has some clothes in it for while you are on the train. In the western US, most trains have cars called Superliners that have 2 levels. They have restrooms downstairs; there are showers onboard, but they are only for passengers who book a sleeper room. If you booked a sleeper car room, you will have a small room to yourself. Plan to be on the train up to 4 days on longer trips (i.e. Chicago to San Francisco, Seattle to L.A., or Seattle to Chicago). Wear comfortable clothing. A t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers would suffice, but something a little nicer never hurts, especially in the evenings or at dinnertime. You may not be trying to win a fashion show, but a little goes a long way. A button-down or polo shirt combined with jeans or slacks would be a perfect match for staying comfortable without looking like you just rolled out of bed.

, Arrive at the station at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure. Trains can be several hours late, or a few minutes early. You don't want to arrive at the station with 3 minutes to spare and have to rush to the platform in time to see your train pulling off into the distance. If your station of origin (and destination) offers baggage service, you can check baggage, like an airline. Not all stations offer this feature, however, and BOTH your origin and destination city need to offer baggage handling for you to check bags.

, Methods of getting on the train can vary greatly from station to station. At some stations, the conductor will scan your e-ticket before you board the train. At others, you get on the train and the conductor will scan your e-ticket onboard. The conductor will also give you a slip of paper called a seat check that has the number of people in your party, your destination, and your seat assignment on it. You must have the seat check in the slot above your seat at all times, otherwise your seat might be reassigned.

, People that ride Amtrak trains are often the most friendly, casual, and laid back people in America. It is not hard to strike up conversations with random strangers, but don't be rude and persistent either. If somebody just wants to watch the scenery go by, let him be.

, Trains are usually at a stop for about 2 minutes. Be ready to disembark from the train as quickly and safely as you can. The conductor will announce several minutes prior to a stop, which car the doors will be open at, and what the stop is. Make sure not to leave anything behind.

, Think of all the manpower that went into your trip, from the Conductor, Engineer, and Dispatcher to the ticket agents, station agents, car cleaners, and maintenance personnel that make Amtrak possible.

, Amtrak is only made possible by government subsidies that keep it running. Plan your next trip, because YOU vote for Amtrak with your wallet! If you use Amtrak and get your friends and your friend's friends, Amtrak will continue!

Build or find a foam pit.,
Get or make a ramp and put it very close to the pit.,
Hit your ramp a few times to get the feeling of the jump; try pulling back on your bars and gunning the throttle, then kick away from your bike (don't let the bike fly over the foam pit, not a good idea).,
Focus mainly on your take-off and exit.,
Hit third gear; this is the best gear to start in for the backflip, as it provides lots of power for a short distance.

,
As you approach the ramp, let off a bit of gas, just enough to get your RPM down before the jump.,
At the top throttle, pull back on your bars, lean back and keep that throttle punched until you complete the rotation.,
Once you're starting to go upside down, do not freak out and jump off; the bike may land on top of you or you will hurt yourself.,
Once you've got the backflip done and completed in the foam pit, keep it there for awhile until you can perfectly master it with no problem at all.,
Keep bringing the ramp farther and farther back, then get ramps which are less steep and try it off them until you can do it at any angle and distance.

,
Bring your 50-60 degree ramp out to your jumps and place it about four-five meters from the landing; this may have a different feeling then the foam pit because you see the ground and the landing is much different.

,
Hit it at the same speed or a bit faster and hook your flip.,
Bring out your ramps and gradually build up to a level were you can just pull them whenever you feel like it and at a reasonable distance.

,
This trick gets harder if the bike is too big or too heavy for you.",How to Pull a Backflip on Your Dirtbike," Building your own is suggested (a large wooden container will work fine). Make sure to secure the sides of the boards. When you jump into the foam pit with your bike, you need to get it out. Try making a crane out of a pulley and rope, strong enough to lift your bike (test it a couple times on the ground) Once that is complete, then you are set to go!;
, You want this ramp close to a 50-60 degree angle. That sounds pretty steep, but you will be able to fly off it and spin easily with the power of your bike (depending on your cc size). Put your ramp about 4 meters (13.1 ft) from the pit (this is where you're going to start your flips).

, Once you have hit the jump enough to start the backflips and feel confident, it's time to try it.

, More specifically, figure out how much you have to pull back on your bars and throttle. Also determine where you are going to land, how you are going to land if you mess up, and how you are going to get off the bike in time.

,, Lean forward on your bars once you're going on the ramp.

, The Gyro effect will give it an extra little boost if you keep that throttle punched.

, It's smart to stay on the bike as long as you can until the last second. Tilt your head back as far as possible to spot your landing, then bring the bars back up to your chest as hard as you can. Once completed the rotation, let go of the gas and smash into the foam pit.

, This is for your personal safety.

,,, When you get the rotation, bring your back tire down just enough to absorb the landing. Don't lean too far forward or too far back, but just enough to keep the bike stable.

,, keep the bike at your level and make sure that it is light enough for you to pick it up an inch while it is on the ground. If you aren't strong enough to lift the bike but you are big enough to ride do so but do this trick under adult supervision if you are under the age of 16.

It must have shocks. They will keep you from getting severe spinal injuries if you fall.;
, Always wear protective gear when dirt biking, even if you think that you are just taking it for a spin. A chest pad, neck brace, strong jeans, a jersey, goggles, and an approved helmet will usually do.


If you're a guy, you may want to consider protection for crotch area.

, You can build a jump out of dirt and water if you cannot find a natural one. Get a large amount of dirt and build a jump as large as you are ready for. Don't push yourself too far and get hurt though––keep the jump height reasonable.


If you're scared, try to do the first jumps over a tiny little jump made of plywood resting on some two by fours.
Start with small jumps and work up to bigger jumps.

, Take it for a few laps, and get the engine running nice and strong ahead of any jumping session.

, Make sure you have somewhere safe to land on the other side and that there are no people, animals or obstructions in the way. Make sure there are no hazardous objects around your landing area, and ensure that there is sufficient run off area to stop.

,, Don't gun it, just go at a decent speed that will get you up and over the jump safely. Do the speed that you can handle and that will be plentiful to ensure a good jump.


Try to get the bike going as fast as you can before hitting the jump.

, Lean forward and press your chest onto the handlebars. Increase your speed a little here; give the dirt bike all the gas it can take before you go off the jump. Compress the suspension, keep the throttle steady off the lip of the jump, to prevent your bike from kicking you forward or losing speed for the jump. This is called front loading, also pre-loading.


Giving it all the gas is called pinning it.

, Get your chest and torso as far away from the handlebars as you can. You don't want to have the wind knocked out of you.


It also may help to pull up on the handlebars heavily as you leave the ground.

, Pinpoint your landing while you are in the air. Lean back on the bike and brace your body for a pretty scary impact.

, Try to use the back tire to hit the ground, then rock forward. It will reduce any pain from being jerked around. Put both feet on each peg at the same instance as landing, to create the most comfortable work environment.

, Landing flat will send the shock from the landing right to you.


Try not to land on both wheels, as this increases your chances of crashing and makes you look like an amateur.
If there is a landing ramp, try to land slightly on your front wheel. If there is no landing ramp, land on the rear wheel and position your feet with the arch on the foot peg.

, Do it over and over, and once you feel safe, build up the height of the jump.

, Only do this step once you can comfortably and safely get 30 feet (9.1 m) off the ground. Try some basic tricks at first, like taking one hand off of the handlebars, or moving one foot off of the foot peg and into the air or onto the seat and then moving it back for the landing. You will eventually be doing hand stands on the handlebars in mid air if you practice.


Enter a competition once you get confident. It's well worth it.

, Here are some common things to watch out for and remedy:


If in midair it becomes apparent you're heading for a front wheel landing - pin the throttle! This will counter your momentum by picking up the front wheel. If this isn't enough, and the angle is to great to land it bail sideways and assume the superman position. A front wheel 'endo' landing is extremely dangerous. It is caused by not enough acceleration at takeoff and can be potentially fatal as there is a good chance you'll end up with your bike on top of you. This situation often occurs to last second doubt/hesitation, the moral is if you think you're in trouble and you're already committed, don't wimp out! Generally, it will get you in more trouble than you're already in!
If your landing is high speed and on a fairly steep downhill, then you need to be landing on both wheels. A back wheel landing can flip you over the bars if your back wheel hits a bump/rock as you get close to the ground.
If in midair it becomes apparent you're heading for a back wheel landing, apply the back brake. This will counter your momentum by dropping the front wheel. Don't forget to use the clutch and don't stall or you'll lose all control! This is a tricky thing to do and only really works on good sized jumps. Remember to let off the brake before you land or you'll be giving your bars a nice big kiss. As above if this doesn't work and you're heading for (half) a backflip bail off sideways. A back wheel landing is caused by too much acceleration at takeoff. For a minor back wheel landing you can crouch over the tank and down on the bars just before landing to balance out the wheels.
If you start crossing up in the air always keep your front wheel pointing in the direction of the landing. If the angle is too great to achieve this, bail to the back side of the bike and assume a crash test dummy position.

Approach with caution.,
Look for signs of an approaching train.,
Stop your car if a train is approaching.,
Wait for the train to pass.,
Make sure the train has passed.",How to Cross a Railroad Crossing1," There should be signs to warn you that you are nearing railroad tracks. Typically, it will be a circular sign with a black X and the letters RR. Once you get closer, you will probably see an X shaped sign that says Railroad Crossing. On the road, there will be another warning that looks similar to the circular sign. Slow your car down when approaching railroad tracks, even if there is no train in sight.Look for signs designating the speed limit. You should not be going faster than 20mph.
If there are no signs, you should be able to see the actual tracks ahead of you. Still approach slowly even if the gate is not down.;
, There are several ways to know if the train is approaching. First, the gate may be down, and you might see the train passing by. If the train has not yet made it to the crossing, you will see flashing red lights signaling its approach. A person might be signaling the train’s approach, but that will not always be the case. You will also hear the train’s horn or bell before actually seeing the train. Look both ways down the track for an approaching train.


You can slowly continue driving across the railroad tracks if you have checked and made absolutely sure that there is no train coming.
Do not at any time stop in the middle of the tracks, even if a train is not approaching.
Roll your windows down to listen for the train’s horn or bell. If music is playing in your car, pause it while listening for signs of an approaching train.

, If there are signs of an approaching train, you should stop your car even if the crossing gate has not yet gone down. Laws vary state by state about how far away you should stop from the railroad crossing. Usually, you should stop within 50 feet, but no closer than 15 feet from the nearest rail. Use your own discretion when deciding how close or far away to stop.If there is a stop sign, you must stop your car even if there is not a train approaching.

, The crossing gate should be down at this point, but do not cross even if the gate has not gone down. Your car should be at a complete stop at this point. Wait for the approaching train to cross the tracks you are waiting at. Continue waiting until the train is out of sight., Although the train has passed, there might be another train approaching. Wait until the lights have stopped flashing and the crossing gate has gone up. You may begin driving again at this point. Don’t accelerate quickly from your stopping position. Slowly cross the tracks with caution in case something has fallen onto the tracks.


Do not shift gears while crossing the tracks.

"
"
Sit in the correct position.,
Build momentum.,
Shift gears.,
Control the throttle.",How to Hill Climb on a Dirt Bike," When going uphill on a dirt bike, position your stance so that your body weight is being pushed forward. This will add to your momentum. The rest of your stance should remain the same as when riding on flat ground.


Squat with your knees bent a few inches off the seat with your feet on the foot pegs. Keep your legs locked and knees grabbing onto the tank. Elbows should be bent with arms locked. Keep your head and shoulders straight, leaning forward almost over the handlebars.






While gripping your handlebars, cover the brake and clutch with your middle or index finger. Keep your grip loose by using only your index finger and thumb. Keep your wrist as straight as possible. Be alert and ready to grab the brake with your fingers from the handlebars.





;
, Before climbing the hill, gather as much speed as possible on your drive towards the hill. Maintain this momentum as you climb the hill.

, As you go up the hill, shift gears to prevent the bike from bogging or dying out. Once the bike bogs out you will not be able to recover.

, Giving too much throttle will cause the back end of the bike to slip, however not enough throttle will cause the front wheel to rise. Practice climbing hills so you get the right feel for throttle control.

Slow your bike when approaching railroad tracks.,
Wait for the train to cross.,
Know the risks of crossing the tracks on a bike.,
Go over the tracks at a 45 degree angle.,
Cross the tracks in a straight line.,
Cross the tracks safely.",How to Cross a Railroad Crossing2," Look for signs of an approaching train. You should see signs, like a sign with an X and RR written on it. Check for flashing lights, a person signaling a train, and a horn or bell from an approaching train. Even if there are no signs of a train, slow your bike. Crossing tracks at full speed on a bike can be dangerous.Make sure you are in the appropriate spot for a bike. The laws may state that bikers stay on the road, or on a specific bike path.

, If there is a train, you should stop your bike completely and wait. Do not try to race across the track before the train approaches. Either continue sitting on your bike, or get off your bike and stand next to it while holding the handle bars. Wait until the train has passed. Make sure another train is not coming. You are able to cross the tracks when the lights have stopped flashing, and the crossing gate has been lifted., There are several risks you are taking when crossing railroad tracks on a bike. Knowing the risks before crossing the tracks will help prevent you from falling or becoming stuck on the tracks. The risks include falling into the gap next to the rail, falling in a gap near the tracks, and sliding on the tracks. The way you cross the tracks depends on what risks your perceive before crossing., Falling into the gap perpendicular to the rail happens because sometimes railroad crossings use coverings to make the railway smoother, but the coverings are made up of individual pieces that leave gaps. The gaps are often wider than a bike tire, which risks the bike tire falling into the gap. To avoid this, cross the tracks close to a 45 degree angle, instead of perpendicularly.


Judge what is a 45 degree angle by using the outermost tracks as your basis for the bottom line of the angle.

, Sliding happens on the tracks when they are slippery and/or wet. Avoid leaning the bike on slippery tracks. Instead, cross the tracks in a straight line. Try to go as slowly as possible when crossing.

, Do not try to line your bike up with the tracks. If your bike tires are narrow, do a slight S weave on the tracks, between 20 and 70 degrees. It is also an option to get off of your bike and walk it across the tracks.You can “hop” across the raised tracks on your bike if you are an experienced bike rider. Do not attempt this if you do not know how to jump with a bike. It is dangerous and could lead to a crash if you are not experienced."
"
Look for a pedestrian crossing.,
Look for an approaching train.,
Cross when it is safe.",How to Cross a Railroad Crossing3," It is illegal to cross railroad tracks at any other location besides a designated pedestrian crossing. If you are not at a pedestrian crossing, walk at a safe distance away from the tracks until you locate one. There should be a sign and/or a ramp for pedestrians to safely cross.Crossing at an illegal location risks your safety, as well as a ticket or fine that can range from $500 or $6000.

, Stop at the pedestrian crossing even if there are no signs of an approaching train. Look both ways down the track to look for a train. Signs of a train are flashing lights, a lowered crossing gate, and bells or whistles. Wait at the designated pedestrian crossing if a train is coming. If not, slowly cross with caution if you are sure it is safe.Not every pedestrian crossing will have lights or bells to warn you. If the crossing does not, look both ways down the tracks and listen for a train.
Stand at a safe distance away from the tracks. You should stand at least 10 feet away from the tracks.

, Wait for the train to completely pass. Do not cross until you are sure that another train is not following. If there is a pedestrian crossing gate, wait until it is lifted to cross. There should be no more lights flashing or bells sounding. Look both ways once more before you cross.Do not listen to music while at a railroad crossing. Music can inhibit your ability to hear bells and/or whistles.
Hundreds of people die every year on railway tracks. Do not play, sit, or walk directly on the tracks. A train takes at least a mile to stop, so it may not be able to stop in time if you are on the railway tracks.Do not try to hop aboard the passing train. You will risk serious injury or death.

Finished.

",How to Buy Your First Dirtbike," This is not a cheap hobby, but don’t be too extravagant with your budget when looking for a bike. In the $300-$600 price range, you can expect to get a bike you need to put a little money and work into. If you spend less than that, you will be harnessed a bike that needs a lot of work, effort, and money. Also, don't spend you entire budget on the bike, as there will always be unexpected costs.;
, The type of bike you get is totally up to you. 2-stroke, 4-stroke, big, or small. If you're not sure, just search the web!

, Finding the right deal is the heart of buying a bike, and oftentimes bikes on places like Craigslist are overpriced. Compare bike prices using eBay; If you find a bike you like, look at past auctions to see the going price.

, If you decide to buy one through Craigslist, it will be easy to get more information about the bike without committing too much information to the seller. Make sure to always contact the seller in the way they ask so you don’t tick them off.

, The more you know about different bikes, how they work, and the motor sport world, the more details you will have to talk about with the seller. When you know what you are talking about, you can find ways to lower the sellers asking price.

, Negotiations start with the first contact. If you are too eager, the seller will get anxious and likely keep his price high because you make him feel like it’s worth more than it is. You can never be too calm about a deal. The more calm and confident you are the better results you will have. However, don't be cocky, it will turn your seller off and tell him you know nothing about what you are talking about.

, If the headlight doesn't work, bring it up. Tell him that it's not exactly what you are looking for and that you don't know if you should take it home or not. Don't go too far though, nothing is worse than a seller that comes to look at your bike and all he does is talk bad about it.

, Give him your bottom line and he might come closer to it than you think. If he doesn't seem to like it, don’t give in to his game. He simply wants to get the most money for his bike. If you act like you don’t care if you get this bike or not, you will have better chances at coming away with a good deal.

, Hopefully, the latter will convince the seller to drop his price further. Don’t be afraid to walk about. But know that there is a limited amount of resources posted on Craigslist, when you find a good or average deal don’t be afraid to commit.

Mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts).,
Compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them.,
Add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down.,
Make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section.,
Focus on a set up that flows.",How to Build Dirt Jumps," The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.

Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt.
Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.



 

;
, Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.

, In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable..

, Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.

, If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.

Decide how much you want to spend on it.,
Decide how big you want it.,
Decide on the materials.,
Find a good, open location.,
Get the right materials and tools for the ramp.,
Decide what kind of jump you want to make:


a 'double' (one jump and one catch),
a 'Step-up' (The landing is higher than the take-off),
an 'Step-down' (The landing is lower than the take-off),
a 'kicker' (just a good ol' dirt jump),
a 'spine' (a jump on one side and the catch is the the other side),
a 'table top' (two jumps with a bridge in the middle to land on or do tricks on).,
Decide how large the jump 'gap' will be, if you want one.

,
Start digging a hole for your jump, or if there are a lot of rocks just take the top layers, or use a wheelbarrow to haul some dirt from somewhere else.,
Pile dirt where you want the jump.,
Shape the piles of dirt into the jumps.,
The catch ramp can either be slightly concave or be flat.,
Take a few runs at it and adjust the ramp.,
Grab some Sweet Air!

",How to Build a Jump for a Dirt Bike," The cost in money and time can get pretty expensive if you want to make a big, high quality ramp.;
, You may want to see existing jumps online or in person to get a feel for your desired size.

, If it is in a field or other out-of-the-way place, a plain dirt-ramp might be your best bet.

, For small, mobile ramps, a low-traffic street or if you have a nice big driveway/car repair lot. Nothing is worse than building a great jump and coming back the next week and it's destroyed by an angry property owner, or the cops!

, (Listed below.)

,
a 'rhythm section' (link your jumps together to create clean and flowing lines)

,,


For a jump with a gap, toss the dirt before or after the gap.
For no gap or a shallow gap, dig to one side or the other side of the trail.

, Keep in mind the landing doesn't have to be as big as the jump. For a table top pile all the dirt in one spot then shape it out to form a top.

, Take your shovel and shape the jump ramp in sort of a concave curve, this gives you more air and you get high, which equals more distance. Take your time so it looks good and works right, make sure not to make it so steep you flip when you hit it. You want the jump and catch to be fairly wide so you have a better chance of hitting it well.

, Think about the landing and shape it accordingly.

, If your front tire comes up too quick then take some of the curve out by adding dirt to the middle or off the top, if you're over shooting the landing, you may want to move the catch ramp.

Have a backup plan in case the station you want to return the bike to is full (no available spots) or not working.",How to Use Divvy Bikes in Chicago1," You can look at the official station map (click on the blue bicycle icon to see how many bikes and open docks there are for that station) or use the Divvy ""CycleFinder"" app.


One way to map out your bike route is to enter your starting and ending addresses on Google Maps and use the ""bicycle"" option. This will also give you a time estimate.;
, If you use a Divvy bike for more than 30 minutes, you'll get charged extra. To break up the trip, you'll want to return your bike before the 30 minutes expire. Dock it, request a new code at the console (you'll swipe the same card that you used to pay for the pass) then use the new code to take out a bike (it can be the same bike as before or a different one, it doesn't matter).

, The app tells you how many bikes are at each station so you can better plan for this. Stations are more likely to be busy or break on busy days, like sunny weekends.


If the station is full, go to the kiosk re-swipe your credit or debit card (24-Hour Pass holders), and select “Station Full?” to add 15 minutes to your trip.

Release the clutch about halfway (or as far out as you can without stalling or shutting off the bike).,
Lean over the bars so that your eyes are parallel with your forks.,
If it makes it any easier, tuck your boots under the front of the foot pegs, this will keep your legs from flying backward as you quickly accelerate!

,
Pull the throttle back about 3/4 open, depending on the dirt (or concrete) you're starting on, you should be in about second gear.

,
As the gate drops, you need to react very quickly, releasing the clutch and front brake at the same time.,
As you come into the first corner, you should be riding on the furthest inside part of the track possible.,
Be cautious of other riders.

Determine how much space you have.,
Decide if portability is best.,
Think about what materials are easier for you to access.",How to Build a Dirt Bike Ramp1," You’ll need around a third of an acre at the bare minimum to make a dirt jump track. If you have any doubts about making the space permanent, it’s a good idea to build a wood ramp instead of digging jumps into the ground. And of course, make sure you have the authority or permission to build or dig.If you decide to dig dirt jumps, you’ll need to locate an area where you’ll have enough room to accelerate, for take-off and landing ramps, and for decelerating and stopping after hitting the jump.
You’ll need even more room if you plan on making a circuit track, or a loop from the end of the jump to its start.;
, Whether you need a portable or permanent jump will determine what you build. A portable, wooden ramp would be better if, for example, you’ve got a great spot to practice jumps up in the mountains that you only drive to every now and then. If you don’t want to or don’t have permission to dig up your land, go with the portable wood ramp. You can tow it to any location suitable for practicing jumps.


In order to build a permanent site, you’ll have to make absolutely sure you have permission to modify the land you’re building on.

, Building a dirt bike ramp is no joke, whether you’re constructing it out of wood or digging it into the ground. If it’s easier and more cost effective to acquire wood beams, planks, a saw, nails, and a nail gun, build a wooden ramp. If you or a friend have easy access to a backhoe or other heavy-duty digging equipment, dig out a dirt jump. Consider what’s easiest to build and easiest on your wallet.

Start digging the hole.,
Build up the dirt mounds.,
Use your bike tires to roll over the jumps.,
Wet the mounds and pack them more.,
Try the ramp out.",How to Build a Dirt Bike Ramp2," Use a sharp, rounded shovel, and get your friends to help get it going. Make it as deep and wide as your skill level can handle: shoot for three or four feet deep and two feet wide for starters. Plan out the hole’s placement, so it’ll eventually form the area in between your jumps.Don't just throw the dirt anywhere. You’ll need it to form take-off and landing mounds.
Getting the ground soft by wetting it down before you dig makes this step easier.
Think of how you want the final product to turn out, making sure you leave room for deceleration.
If you prefer a loop, map out a circuit track that leads back to the start of the course with a hose, rope, or other long, movable object. Once you’ve decided on the best track, use a shovel to dig it out.
Use a backhoe or other heavy-duty digging equipment if you have access.

, Use the dirt that you dug out from the jump’s hole to build out the take-off and landing ramps. To make the cores of the ramps, use construction surplus, like broken concrete, cinder blocks, and bricks. Form them into a suitable mound shape and begin to cover them with dirt. Do not use logs, branches, or similar items that will decay and cause your jumps to collapse. Add thick layers of dirt, and pack them in to form a secure, solid mound.


The mounds’ heights varies on your skill level. Don’t bite off more than you can chew: don’t go over two feet in height if you’re a beginner.

, If you don’t have another vehicle to do so, use your bike to really pack in the dirt mounds. At a slow speed, roll your front tire up the ramp to make the lip. This also compacts the ramp more, making them more usable and stable.


The landing ramp should always be bigger than the take-off ramp and not as steep as the take-off ramp.

, Get the mounds wet and muddy, and pack them in even more. Use your bike wheels again and stamp your feet. After letting the dirt harden in the sun for two or three days, wet and pack them at least once more.It’s important to take time to make sure everything is compacted, otherwise your landing will hurt..

, Give the ramp a test, and make changes as necessary. You might find that you need to make the lips on either jumping or landing ends smoother by scraping off dirt. Or, on the other hand, you might find that you need to add more dirt. If so, repeat the process of wet packing the mounds.

Nail in the second pair of vertical supports 30 inches from the first pair.,
Nail in the third and fourth pairs of vertical supports.,
Install the middle supports.,
Cut and install horizontal beams to top the vertical supports.,
Install plywood sheets for the ramp surface.,
Nail in cross supports from corner to corner.",How to Build a Dirt Bike Ramp3," You can find plans online for either a full freestyle rampor a basic FMX ramp.Alternatively, if you’re mechanically skilled and already have a lot of knowledge about ramp sizing and proportions, you can make your own drawings. It is, however, important to get your measurements and a visual down on paper before you get started.


You should have some experience with woodworking before attempting to build a ramp on your own.
Do not use tools such as saws or nail guns without permission, ability, and, if necessary, supervision., Use 2x6"" lumber for your support structure. Measure and cut four 10 foot beams for the base supports.Then, measure and cut four sets of vertical support beams. Each beam will need to be angled at the top end. This angle will form the incline of your ramp.


It’s easiest, quickest, and most accurate to use a miter saw to make the crosscut for the angle at the top of the vertical supports. If you don’t have a miter, you’ll just have to carefully measure and mark your boards to make sure they’re cut as precisely as possible.For a basic FMX ramp, cut the tallest vertical supports so one side is 40"" in height and the other is 36"". Each individual beam should thus have one side that’s longer than the other. The result will be a 56 degree slant, or angle, at their tops.
For the second tallest pair of vertical supports, cut them so one side is 22 1/2"" and the other is 19 3/4"". Each should have a slant at their tops of about 65 degrees.
Cut the third pair of vertical supports so one side is 10 1/2"" and the other is 8 1/2"".
Cut the fourth pair of vertical supports so one side is 2 3/4"" and the other is 1 1/2"".

, Lay two 10 foot 2x6"" beams down parallel on their 6"" faces. These will be the support structure’s “feet.” Using 3"" nails throughout, nail another 2x6"" beam along each support foot’s side, so they’re perpendicular, or form an “L” shape. The second pair of 10 foot beams will form a lip that’ll hold in place the rest of the vertical support beams., The first pair of 2x6"" vertical supports are the ones that measure 36"" and 40"" at their tops. Position one flush against the lip formed by the 10 foot beams, all the way to the end of one side, and nail it into place. Nail the other tallest support post into place on the other support foot.Make sure these and all other support posts mirror each other. The slants at their tops should face the same way, so they form the incline of the ramp., Measure 30"" in from the ends of the first pair of support posts and mark the spot with a pencil. This is where you’ll position the second pair. Position them, and nail them into place on both sets of 10 foot bottom beams.

, For the third pair of vertical supports, measure 60"" in from end of the first set of vertical posts. Mark the measurement, position the posts, and nail them into place. For the fourth set, measure 120"" from the ends of the first set, mark, position, and nail them.

, At this point, you should have two sets of 10-foot bottom supports with four vertical posts nailed into each. You will link them together by nailing down middle supports at each vertical post. Measure and cut four 3 foot, 2x6"" beams. Line up the bottom 10-foot long supports, keeping them parallel, and space them three feet apart. Start on each end to make sure the supports are square, and position the middle support beams where you’ve nailed each pair of vertical posts.Carefully position first to get a feel for their fit. You might even use masking tape to hold them in place.
Make sure you’ve got everything flush and square, then start nailing the middle supports into place.
Take special care on this step: it’s essential to make sure the two halves are square and lined up with each other or your ramp will turn out unstable.

, Now that you’ve built the basic support structure, you have to start on the ramp itself. The vertical supports with the angled tops that you’ve built will hold beams across them. In turn, these horizontal beams will support the ramp surface.Cut three 3-foot, 2x6"" beams. These three beams will be for the first, third, and fourth pairs of vertical posts.
Use a 3-foot, 2x4"" beam to top the second-tallest pair of vertical supports. A 2x4"" here, rather than a 2x6"", will give the plywood sheets that will form the surface of the ramp more give., Cut 1/2"" plywood into 3-foot by 6-foot sheets. To attach them to the support structure, it’s important to use 2 1/2"" to 3"" screws instead of nails. Nails will not hold the plywood surface in place properly.Drive them as close to the edge of the sheet as possible for maximum stability. Once you’ve installed one layer of plywood, add a second to cover it.Make sure to overlap the edges of your plywood: don’t let their ends match up, or the result will be a groove that’ll ruin your ramp. You’ll have to cut the second layer of plywood sheets at a different length in order to keep your sheets from matching up.Use a steel saw to clean the ramp up and cut off any plywood overhanging at the high end of the ramp., Once you’ve added double layers of plywood sheets for the ramp surface and removed any unsupported, overhanging edges, add 2x6"" cross supports to the tallest set of vertical posts. Measure the diagonal distance between the four corners, and cut beams to match that length."

, Your myki must have a balance of at least $0.01. Check the fares beforehand, and load enough money onto your card to get you \where you need to go. You may also ride if you've purchased a myki pass for the zone(s) you are traveling in – in which case, you must have a positive balance (at least $0.01.) If your balance is too low, add funds or buy a paper ticket.If your myki money balance is negative, you will not be able to touch on and ride until you ""top up"" your card with myki money. This applies even if you have a valid myki pass.
It's best to check your balance ahead of time. If you arrive at the station with insufficient funds, then you might miss your train in the scramble to top up!

, At the station, hold your myki up to the myki reader. Aim for the centre of the reader's card area, where you'll see a picture of the myki. Hold your myki on the reader until you hear a beep. This means your myki is now ""touched on"".


If you are touching at a train station barrier: you will hear hear a beep, the gates will open, and the screen will display ""CSC PASS."" CSS stands for Contactless Smart Card. Proceed through the gates.
Readers at non-gated stations—and on board buses and trams—will say ""Touch On Successful."" The reader screen will also display your balance and the expiration date of your myki pass.

, When you get off at your stop or exit the station, touch your myki to a card reader to tell the system that your ride is over. Listen for the beep indicating that your card has been ""touched off."" Proceed to leave the station.


Read your balance. Each time you touch off, your myki balance will be displayed on the screen for as long as you hold it to the reader. This does not apply at gated railway stations.
You do not have to touch off a tram unless you are travelling exclusively within Zone 2. In this case, touching off will give you the lowest fare.

, Most buses do not have the ability to give change and asking the other riders for change is not the most efficient way to go about starting a trip. If your dollars are wrinkled, smooth them out as much as possible to ensure a smooth transaction at the fare box so that the people waiting behind you can enter the bus quickly. Whenever possible use ""Golden Dollars"" or Susan B. Anthony dollars. Be prepared.

, Some operators (bus drivers) know some popular locations on their route but they are really looking to the passengers to know where they are going.

, Each person is a traveler on their way to some destination. The bus may become crowded and patience is a handy thing to have. Short tempers do nothing but disrupt the progress of the bus and make the ride longer.

, If you are sitting down, stand up as soon as you see the bus. If it is not the bus you want make a motion for the bus to keep going or step away from the curb or stop. The best way to communicate that you do not want the bus is to step behind the bus bench if available. If on the freeway, because of the high rate of speed and momentum of the bus, sit down as soon as you realize the bus is not the one you want and vice versa if it is the one you need.

Consider how you’ll be using the bike. If you’re using the bike to go back and forth to work, to the grocery store, and to run other errands on pavement. Consider a road bike, which is quick, efficient, and light.
Determine if a mountain bike is a sound investment. They are durable and can jump easily from pavement to mud and sand. They are built to take a thrashing. They’re just not that great for endurance rides.Consider the weight of the bike. It might not seem very heavy going for a spin around the block. It will be much heavier as you pedal it through miles on your way home from work. Buying a lighter frame will make the ride home much more manageable.;
, Keep your budget in mind. Classifieds and online sources are a great place to begin. Also, ask a friend if they have a bike they’d be willing to sell.


Get a bike multi-tool, tire patches, a spare tire, lube, and a flashlight. Keep them in your riding bag in case of emergency.
Buy a bike lock and use it.Talk to someone at a bike store to find out what will work best for you. Always use multiple locking mechanisms. Although not foolproof, a kryptonite U-lock with a four foot long cable is a good way to prevent bike thieves.
Get bad weather gear. You’ve gotten rid of your car, so you’ll be exposed to the elements on your rides home. Being prepared means a smooth ride.
Buying a waterproof bag to keep your equipment in will help you out. Check for used ones online for the best deal.

, Bikes, like cars, need proper maintenance. A small amount of care can make all the difference in your ride.


Learn how to take care of your bike. Your bike is a series of moving parts. Learn each of these moving parts and what they do.When you expose them to the elements like rain, mud, sand, or snow, the parts will begin to deteriorate. A few simple steps can save you a breakdown in the middle of your commute.
Do a pre-ride inspection. Like a car, you will benefit from making sure there are no glaring problems to hinder your ride before you begin pedaling. Check the tires, for any loose parts, the chain, and the brakes.
Clean your bike. Wipe it all over with a dry rag. Take note of any loose parts. Base your cleaning schedule on how often you ride. If you ride every day, wipe your bike down every few.
Secure any loose bolts. Don’t over tighten them by cranking down on them.
Apply lube to protect moving parts (the chain, the brake and derailleur levers, the brake and derailleur cables, the brake and derailleur assemblies, and the bearing systems) from the natural wear and tear of riding. It will keep rust and corrosion at bay. Don’t over-lubricate as too much will attract dirt and debris.

, Many bikes are stolen because they are not properly secure. Becoming familiar with how to lock your bike up will help give you some piece of mind as you are going about your day.


Use your bike lock. Always. A good lock is your first line of defense against would-be bike thieves.
Know how to lock your bike. Put your cable through your frame and both wheels. The U-lock goes through the back wheel (inside the rear triangle of the frame). Secure the bike to something solid. This approach locks the rear wheel and the frame.
The smaller the U-lock the better. It’s easier to carry around and is harder to break.
Consider the insurance quality bike locks offer. You can fill out a form online after purchase, and in the event someone steals your bike, they will pay your homeowners or renters insurance deductible or they will pay to replace the bike. Research your options. Don’t throw any receipts away (for the bike, the locks, or the tools).

, If you can, take it inside with you and find a safe place to store it while you’re away. Make sure to lock it when you are not around, even if it’s just for a short time.


Use a small U-lock if you lock your bike to a parking meter, never just a cable. A small U-lock makes it impossible to lift the bike over the top.Look for immovable bike racks installed outside of buildings. Check to make sure it’s bolted down and solid. Never lock your bike to something flimsy, like a chain-link fence which can be easily snipped open.
Look for parking garages and parking lots that are bike-friendly. While some ask for a minimal fee, it’s worth the cost for peace of mind.
Bring your bike inside when you return home if you can. If you can’t, secure your bike with as much precaution as you would when you take it out. Even if you’re tired, taking these extra steps will help insure you have a ride tomorrow.
Bring any accessories with you after parking your bike: lights, water bottles, seat, etc.
Take care of yourself, too. A soggy-wet, cold bike ride is miserable.Dress to stay dry. Buy a waterproof vest or jacket with a hood. Rain pants are always a great investment.

Move quickly.,
Sit away from people.,
Put your coat or bag on the seat next to you.,
Look away.,
Close off your body language.,
Don’t smile.,
Wear a hat.",How to Avoid Conversation on Public Transportation1," When you enter, walk directly over to a seat without lingering. Don’t pause to look at other passengers or make eye contact. When you move quickly, you will appear focused and busy, thus discouraging interaction. If you take your time and look around, you are likely to make yourself appear more available.;
, Strategically seating yourself is a great way to avoid interaction. Find a seat that is away from other passengers. Especially try to avoid sitting across from someone else whenever possible, because people sitting across from you are most likely to strike up a conversation. Try to find a quiet corner somewhere in the back where you won’t be bothered.Scope out the bus or train while you are waiting in line. Pay attention to the empty areas so that you can move quickly to them. Also notice which areas are filled with people and be sure to walk right past any of these.
Preferably find a place near the back. If you sit near the front, even if it is empty, passengers who enter later will be more likely to sit there.

, If there are several empty seats, place your bag or jacket on a seat near you to discourage anyone from sitting there. New passengers are much more likely to simply take an empty seat rather than to ask you to move your things. They might even assume that the seat is saved for someone., When you sit down, make sure to keep to yourself, avoiding eye contact. If you make eye contact with other passengers, you will give the impression that you are open to interacting. It is best to either look down, look out the window, or you can even rest your head against the window and close your eyes. People will think you are sleeping and will hesitate to interrupt you., If you hunch over slightly and cross your arms while looking down, you will look closed off, thus deterring conversation. People will recognize that you don’t desire to talk. If you sit up with good posture and are looking eye level with others, you appear open and available to them., Try to look like you are focused on something else or deep in thought. Do this by keeping your mouth in a neutral position and press your eyebrows slightly down. A focused facial expression will give the impression that you are busy and want to keep to yourself. If you smile and look happy, you will naturally invite people to talk to you. You don’t need to look angry, just try not to look too friendly., This can block your eye line from people, which will make them less likely to talk to you. A baseball cap with the brim slightly over your eyes will close you off from those around you. They will be less likely to talk to someone that they can’t see well, especially because eye contact is generally a precursor to conversation.


If it is winter, you could even bundle up with a scarf. Anything that hides your face a bit will make it harder for people to talk to you because they won’t be quite sure who they are talking to.

Find out the bus routes in your city and plan your route.,
Bring exact change.,
Bring your own entertainment.,
Be polite.",How to Live Without a Car2," They should be available online. If not, ask the bus driver and he/she should be able to help. Don’t be afraid to ask, especially if you are using multiple transfers.


Learn how to use a transfer ticket. A transfer will allow the passengers to board a second bus or train going in the same direction to complete their trip. Transfers are generally free (check online or call the transit center for transfer prices) and can be requested at the time of payment.Transfers are generally only available one-way. Also, you may have to wait for the next line when you transfer, so schedule extra time to complete your trip.
Master the pickup times. Time how long it takes you to walk from home to the station. Subtract that time from the pickup time and you’ll know exactly when you need to leave the house. Give yourself a few minutes on both ends.
Keep the transit systems number in your phone so you can call to check the times in case of inclement weather or traffic delays. Often transit systems have apps you can download onto your phone that are very helpful. Take advantage of these if you can.

, They don’t offer change, so this part is up to you. Having it in your hand as you board will make the exchange as pleasant as possible.


Consider buying a pass. In many cases, there are discounted bus passes to people. Check out the costs online and do the math to see whether it’s cheaper to buy a month or year-long pass.

, Using transit means you have extra time to yourself. Use this time for something you enjoy!


Bring a book. Buying cheap paperbacks at the thrift store is economical and fun. You can also invest in a reading pad and download books for free from your local library.
Bring your own music. Downloading music through your phone or buy an iPod. Older models are very inexpensive online and can be used just for downloading music. Make sure to keep the volume at a level that won’t bother your surrounding neighbors.
Listen to a radio program. There are many great apps to download so you won’t miss your favorite radio show now that you don’t have a car. Download them, sit back, and enjoy your time.

, Use your best manners and treat everyone with courtesy and respect. Good manners are contagious and they can keep bad manners at bay.


Keep your bag in your lap. Don’t spread your stuff out.
Don’t eat on the bus. Just don’t. Wait until you get out.Offer your seat if someone older or otherwise infirm boards. It’s a polite and respectful thing to do.
Say thank you to your transit driver. It might be the thing that keeps them waiting an extra ten seconds for you on the day you’re accidentally late.

Research the station and its location to you. You may need to take a bus or ride your bike there. Find out how long it will take you to arrive to your destination. Determine the price of your fare and if you’ll need to transfer.

, The turnstiles where you buy your ticket will be readily apparent. They accept cash, but cards are generally easier to deal with.


Look for the turnstile or gate where you can buy your fare. Never get on a train without paying the fare––getting caught is incredibly expensive and can go on your record.

, Passes are oftentimes cheaper than buying a ticket every day.


Do the math by multiplying each day you use the train by the cost of the ticket. Compare that number to the price of a week or month long pass.

, If you’re not sure where the boarding area is, look at a map or follow the signs.


Once you arrive at your platform, wait a safe distance from the tracks. Pay attention to where you are walking and where the train will arrive. Keep your head up and stay alert.
When the train arrives, allow other passengers to disembark before you get on. Don’t stand in front of the door and expect them to walk around you; stand to the side and give them proper room to leave the train.

, Get all the way on; don’t let any part of you (including the straps of your bag) dangle outside of the doors.


Make sure you are on the correct train by listening to the destination and route. If you’re not, get off at the next stop and reevaluate.

, Bring a book, download music, or play games on your phone.

Eat something.,
Pray or meditate.,
Look at your phone.,
Play a game.,
Take a nap.",How to Avoid Conversation on Public Transportation2," Nothing says you are unavailable quite like having headphones on. Wear over-the-ear headphones so that people are sure to see them. Earbuds work too, but aren’t as effective because they can be difficult to see. Music is great for stopping conversation because it restricts your hearing. People will be much less likely to talk to you because they will assume that you can’t hear them well. You would have to remove your headphones to have a good conversation, which makes it difficult for people to talk to you.This tip works even if you don’t feel like listening to music. You can simply wear your headphones without music and people will assume that you are listening to music.
If someone does try to talk with you while you are wearing headphones, you can say something like, ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you.""

, This shows that you are occupied and makes the other person decide whether what they have to say is important enough to interrupt you. This also demonstrates your lack of interest because you are both looking down and engaging in another activity. It also gives you a good way out of a conversation on the off chance that they do interrupt you. You could say something like, “I’m sorry but I need to get back to my book now. I’m dying to know what happens next!” The other person will likely accept this and allow you to go back to reading.Sometimes this can backfire, for example, if someone else really likes to read and wants to ask you about your book. In case this happens, keep your responses brief to show that you aren’t interested in talking about your book, but prefer to read it. If they don’t get the hint, you can always say something like, “It was great talking with you but I’m going to return to my book now. I really want to finish this chapter.” If the other person is a reader, they will likely understand.

, Bring a notebook and spend time journaling or writing. You could also type something on your computer or tablet. This will help ward off unwanted conversation because it shows people that you are busy and are working on something. It will also help you to avoid eye contact. If someone does try to ask you about your writing, you can say something like, “I’m writing a piece for my class and I really need to finish it.” They will likely let you get back to your work.

, Have a snack while you are riding public transportation. It’s quite difficult to talk with a full mouth. If someone interrupts you mid bite, they will have to wait for you to chew and swallow, which makes for a slow and frustrating conversation. You can even exaggerate this a bit and take a long time chewing before you respond, then immediately take another bite. They will likely give up and find someone else to talk to.Try eating an apple. You can take big bites and chew slowly so that people see you aren’t able to talk.

, Spend some time with God or take a moment to clear your mind. People are less likely to bother you if you are engaged in a spiritual activity. To make sure that they know not to bother you, close your eyes and fold your hands. The other passengers should leave you alone.

, If you are busy texting someone or using an app or checking social media on your phone, you will be looking down and avoiding strangers. If someone does interrupt you, you can give a quick answer, like “yes,” and then get right back to your phone to show that you aren’t available to talk., Bring a handheld game console and play a game. Games often require a lot of focus, so it will be difficult for you to talk and play at the same time. Handheld games are generally for a single player, so you are doing something that no one else can join. This will help them to see that you aren’t interested in connecting with them right now., When in doubt, take a nap. It is always awkward to wake up someone who is sleeping, especially if you don’t even know them. If you don’t feel safe sleeping on public transportation, you can simply close your eyes. No one will know the difference and they will definitely hesitate to disturb you. This shows people that you are completely unavailable for talking."

Give short answers.,
Don’t look at the other person when you respond.,
Exit the conversation gracefully.,
Be honest.,
Change seats.",How to Avoid Conversation on Public Transportation3," If someone asks you your name, you can say, “I’m Bob.” But don’t reciprocate the question, or you will give them the impression that you are interested in conversing. If you ask them questions or start adding a lot to the conversation, the person will assume that you are enjoying the conversation and will continue it. To show that this isn’t true, it is important that you don’t engage with them beyond short answers., If you turn to them while answering and look them in they eye, this will show interest and will forge a connection with them. If you continue with your activity and don’t look up while answering, they will feel like you aren’t really connecting, which makes for a dissatisfying conversation. This should cause them to stop and try talking with someone else instead.

, After they have talked for a bit, if they aren’t getting the hint and aren’t aware that they are having a one-sided conversation, gracefully end the conversation. Be respectful and direct. When there is a pause in the conversation/soliloquy, you could say something like, “It’s been nice hearing all about your family, Mary, but I actually have some work I need to get done now. Take care.” This shows that you heard them and listened, but you simply aren’t able to talk. The other person should respect this and allow you to do what you want to be doing., Some people simply love to talk or aren’t very good at reading body language or understanding social norms. In case they talk to you even after you’ve made yourself unavailable, be kind and honest to them. Say something like, “It was nice meeting you but I’m really tired and need to close my eyes for a few minutes.” You can be kind and still communicate your needs to someone. You never need to be captive to someone else’s words. Any conversation is a two-way street. If one party isn’t interested, then the conversation needs to end., In case someone is downright rude and refuses to respect your wishes to be left alone, relocate somewhere else. At the next stop, walk over to the opposite side of the vehicle and sit there. If the person is making you uncomfortable or seems like they might follow you, this would be a good time to sit near someone else, just in case.This is a last resort. It shouldn’t generally be necessary unless someone is really giving you a hard time. If they are bothering you and won’t stop, consider calling someone for help or leaving the vehicle at a stop where there are lots of people around. Your safety is most important.

Understand how locations on the platform correspond to cars of the train


Some of the more modern mass transit systems, particularly those in East Asia (Seoul, Hong Kong, Beijing, and other parts of China) have platform screen doors that align with the doors of the arriving train and open in sync with the arriving train.,
Determine the least crowded car and least crowded entrance within the car, for travel without transfers.,
Consider how close your car will be to the train you will be transferring to, for travel with transfers.,
Become familiar with any special rules that your transit system has for who can board what cars of a train.",How to Avoid Crowds in Mass Transit1," Older mass transit systems have markers indicating where the train doors will be placed when the train stops. The platform screen doors and/or markers can give you an idea of how the train will stop.
Some mass transit system run trains of variable length. The station is designed to accommodate the maximum train length. How shorter trains stop can depend on the transit system. For instance, for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, trains stop approximately in the middle, with a subtlety: while trains with an even number of cars stop exactly in the middle, trains with an odd number of cars leave an extra car's worth of empty space in the front. Some transit systems front-align, i.e., the front car always stops at a particular point regardless of train length. Others rear-align, i.e., the rear car always stops at a particular point regardless of train length.
Mass transit systems with variable train length generally display explicit information about the length of the arriving train in the electronic displays. Note that this information may not be available as part of the regular schedule because the length of trains may be a function of dynamic factors such as availability of cars and expected passenger load.
Some stations have information on how trains of different lengths will stop. The information may be displayed dynamically (i.e., for the next train) or as static signage describing how various train lengths will be treated.;
,

Decide what is the car most likely to have seating space at the time that you board it if your only goal is to find space to sit. Subsequent crowding of the car is not too relevant.
If space to sit is out of the question anyways, and your goal is to find a car that will have the least level of crowding throughout the journey, it is also important to consider the load at future stations.
In general, the distribution of the load of boarding passengers at each station depends on the station layout. Cars that are closer to the entrance points to the station platform tend to be more crowded, since many people, including those who arrive ""just in time"" to take the train and those who don't try to reposition within the station, tend to take that car. Therefore, at the station where you are boarding, what matters is the design of all the stations before you.A typical mass transit system will have reasonably similar designs for most of its stations, so you may be able to use publicly available heuristics on crowdedness for your mass transit system. For instance, for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the middle cars tend to be the most crowded and the front and rear cars least crowded.The same is true for Japan's train system.For the F and L trains on the New York City's Subway system, the front cars of the 4-car trains are the most crowded, and the rear cars are the least crowded, whereas 6-car trains are more crowded in the middle.Be cognizant of the length of the train when doing these calculations. If you expect the train to be longer than it is, you may end up waiting at a part of the platform where the train won't stop.

,

For BART, when transferring from shorter trains to longer trains across an island platform, it is particularly important to be at the front or rear car of the shorter train, otherwise you will be too far from the front or rear car of the longer train. However, when transferring from a longer train to a shorter train, it is more helpful to be at the car directly corresponding to the front or rear car of the shorter train being transferred to.
Read the displayed information that is shown on some subway systems (such as Seoul's subway system), regarding what part of the station to board so as to make one's transfer most efficient.If the crowdedness varies significantly for cars close to the entrance to the platform and cars far away, it may be better for you to forgo boarding a train if you arrive just in time at the platform, and instead board the next train for which you'll have time to reach the correct part of the platform. However, if you are able to enter in a car that has no seating space but has only a moderate number of people standing, you may be able to migrate within the train to a more suitable car (at the risk of disturbing some fellow passengers during your journey). Not all trains allow people to move between cars under ordinary circumstances.

,

Mass transit systems in many parts of Asia (Japan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia), Mexico, Brazil, and some other countries have some train cars reserved for women.In some countries (such as Japan) these women-only rules apply only during rush hour. Their purpose is to reduce the incidence of sexual harassment of females on mass transit. If you are a male passenger, make sure not to stand at the parts of the platform where the women-only cars stop. Females are generally allowed to board other train cars as well. If you are female, familiarize yourself with your mass transit system's conventions regarding boarding general cars. In some mass transit systems, such as Mumbai's suburban railway system, the women-only passenger cars can be more crowded on some routes during rush hour (since they account for only 25% of train cars and women can account for a larger fraction of travelers along some routes). Thus, a number of women avail of the general train cars.There may be restrictions on times you can board if you are boarding with a bicycle, or the level of crowdedness of the train when you can board. For instance, BART does not allow bikes in the first car, and does not allow bikes in the first three cars during rush hour.Some transit systems have special train cars with restricted access and higher ticket prices. An example is Mumbai's suburban railway system, that has ""first class"" coaches, where tickets cost 8 times the general ticket cost (however, with monthly passes the cost ratio is only 4). Part of the purpose of the high cost is to make the tickets sufficiently unaffordable that the ""first class"" cars do not get too crowded, so if you are averse to crowding this option might be worth availing."
"
Figure out how crowdedness varies by the departure time of your train.,
If your station is a ""tipping point"" station, make sure you arrive sufficiently well in advance of your train's scheduled time so as to be at the head of the line for your train car.",How to Avoid Crowds in Mass Transit2," Research has shown that crowdedness can vary very heavily with even small changes in departure time, and that choosing a more suitable departure time can improve your travel experience.The simplest model is that crowdedness follows a two-peaked distribution, with the peaks occurring respectively during the morning and evening rush hours. If this simple model applies to your mass transit system, you should try to select travel times that are as far as possible from the respective peaks, subject to other constraints (such as when you need to get to work, what is the earliest you can get up, when you can get off, and when you need to get back home).
One complication is that transit systems vary both the frequency of trains and the length of trains by time of day. Therefore, the load you see in your train car may not scale in sync with the overall system load. One implication of this is that the load can be multi-peaked: for instance, there can be a peak during the actual morning rush hour peak, and there can be another peak when the rush hour service gets scaled down. Patterns vary heavily based on your mass transit system.
Another relatively minor complication arises in cases where the mass transit system has one key business/financial district or university stop that most commuters travel to. In this case, load tends to be maximum for trains that arrive at that financial district close to the start of an hour or half-hour, in line with typical reporting times for work or study. However, this phenomenon is usually not sharp enough because the business district is rarely that heavily concentrated.

,


A ""tipping point"" station is one where the passenger load factor crosses from below to above 1, i.e., the train car you are interested in boarding goes from having a few empty seats to having a few people standing. Most stations aren't tipping point stations: for most stations, either the passenger load factor both at the start and the end is less than 1, or the passenger load factor both at the start and end is greater than 1.
Based on the load patterns for your morning transit, you should be able to figure out whether your station is likely to be a tipping point station (note that the tipping point station can vary by daily fluctuation, however, for a given time of day and a given car, it is usually one of 2-3 adjacent stations.
If your station is a tipping point station, it matters whether you are among the first or the last to board the train car. In this case, being a little early to board your train car can make the difference between getting a seat and not getting a seat. You need to observe when the line for your train car starts forming in order to determine your optimal arrival time.
If you are at a tipping point station, and you arrive just in time to catch a train it may be better to let it depart and catch the next train, assuming approximately equal levels of crowding.

"
"
Consider boarding at a different station.,
Consider riding in the direction opposite that of travel and then transferring.,
Consider investigating unconventional route transfers for a complicated system.",How to Avoid Crowds in Mass Transit3,"

If you are close to two stations, boarding at the station earlier in the line can allow you to get a less crowded car. Note that this is particularly important if the station you usually board at is a tipping point station.
The flip side is that the cost and time for travel may increase a bit. The details depend on whether your transit system uses a fixed fare or variable fare model, and, in the case of variable fares, on the specifics of how the different origin stations differ in terms of the fares to your destination.

, For instance, you might consider a brief ride to a station that is earlier on your line, by boarding a train in the opposite direction. Essentially, ride in the opposite direction as far as needed so as to get before the tipping point.


With most mass transit systems, within-system transfers are free and you therefore do not incur any additional direct financial costs. However, the Paris Metro is an exception: for many stations, you need to exit the system in order to be able to board the train going in the opposite direction (however, for those with unlimited passes, which are not too expensive in Paris, exiting and re-entering the station imposes no additional cost). Therefore, make sure that you have confirmed that it is possible to switch to the line in the other direction at no additional cost before you consider this strategy.
This strategy increases your total travel time for two reasons: you now have added a two-way journey to a point farther up the line, and you have added an additional transfer between trains.
The strategy does not decrease the overall crowdedness of your train car. It may, however, allow you to get seating space in your train car.
Any benefits you accrue in terms of getting a seat are nullified at your next transfer point. Thus, this strategy does not make sense for a short first leg of a journey.

,

This strategy may be relevant if your subway system has many different crossover points for transferring between lines. Examples of subway systems with sufficient complexity to make optimization useful are those of Paris, Beijing, and Seoul. In fact, there is empirical evidence of significant numbers of people taking longer routes in Seoul to avoid crowds."
"
After boarding, move to a part of the car that is presently less crowded and is less likely to get crowded.,
Follow the standard conventions of your mass transit system to minimize the space you take and the extent to which you antagonize fellow passengers.On mass transit systems with moderate levels of crowding but generally good safety records, it is recommended that, if you are carrying backpacks, you place then in front of or between your feet.On mass transit systems that endure very heavy crowding, placing your backpack at your feet risks getting separated from it, due to either pickpockets or the movement of the crowd.",How to Avoid Crowds in Mass Transit4," However, note the exception for the first leg of a transfer.

People usually cluster near the doors, for a variety of reasons that have been the subject of psychological study.The areas farther from the door, which may be in the middle of the car or at the ends (depending on the car design) may therefore be a better place to stand.Keep in mind one downside of this: if you are farther from the door, there is a larger mass of people to wade through when exiting the train. If the train is likely to be crowded at the time you exit, you need to weigh that downside.
If this is a short first leg of a trip (i.e., you intend to transfer to another train) it may be preferable to stay close to the door so that you can exit faster and make it more quickly into the other train.
As a general rule, it is easy to move within the train if the passageway has a single column occupied and can accommodate two columns, or has two columns occupied and can accommodate three columns. If this is true at your point of entry and exit, but the train becomes more crowded in between, these strategies are worthwhile.

, On such systems, it is recommended that you travel light. Some people follow the practice of wearing the backpack on their front so as to minimize the risk of theft and separation from their property.Make sure to hold on to handrails. Crowds can get more frustrating if you keep bumping into people when the train changes direction or stops or starts suddenly.
Avoid making loud noises or otherwise drawing attention to yourself as that can get you into fights with others in the crowd and ruin your day. This is particularly important in very crowded transit conditions and at high temperatures."
"
Stay aware of system-wide delays.,
Stay aware of other factors that cause high crowds (even in the absence of system delays).,
If you see a train that is more crowded than usual, be smart about whether to board it.,
In bad situations, consider using alternative transportation modes.",How to Avoid Crowds in Mass Transit5," Sign up for email alerts, Twitter notifications, or any other appropriate notification service from your transit agency. This allows you to be informed of system-wide delays before you enter the system.

In the case of a system-wide delay, you have to trade off two factors: given that the travel time is greater, you need to enter earlier in order to reach your destination on time, against the fact that delay and crowdedness are high right now and will likely return to normal if you delay your travel. You need to understand the situation based on your knowledge of how quickly the transit agency recovers from delays and other factors to make an informed judgment.

,

Sporting events, music festivals, and political rallies can cause some routes to get highly crowded for particular time ranges. If you do not intend to attend the specific event, and have some flexibility regarding the time or route of travel, try to avoid the crowds.
In some cases, problems with alternative transportation modes (such as traffic jams on highways) can lead to greater crowding on mass transit.

,

Listen for controller, station agent, or train operator announcements that explain the situation, including information on whether the extra crowding is a feature of that train alone or a system-wide delay.
If another less crowded train is right behind, the operator will usually announce this.
Use your general understanding of how load varies with time of day to make an informed judgment. If load is still increasing (i.e., the current time is before the rush hour peak) then boarding now is better than boarding later. If load is decreasing in expectation, it may be better to delay boarding.
Consider riding in the opposite direction, as discussed in Method 3.

,

Consider walking, driving, taking a bus, or using an on-demand transportation service.
The train system may suggest alternative modes of travel, and may even offer discounts on the use of these alternative modes of travel in order to alleviate crowding.

Finished.

",How to Make a Portable Art Kit," It's up to you what you use. Pencils, markers, inks, etc. Identify what container you want, too.;
, An example of this would be:

Mechanical Pencil. It's sharp, you don't need a sharpener, it's portable (and has an eraser built in!) You can buy these just about anywhere. As long as they won't break easily and are light, easy to refill, and you can use anywhere,






Coloured pencils. The staple of colouring for some, others it's just for a mock up. Bring the main six colours you use. (Normally, some brands can blend to make other colours.)You can also buy these in a mechanical form from specialty office stores- see the fashion stationery section. They come in a box with a pin-hole like sharpener. They are also, rather easy to use after a while of breaking leads.






Outlining pens. Some use super-fine sharpies, whilst others may use ballpoints. Make sure that it's cheap and easy to use. Experiment with these.






Markers. They could replace coloured pencils,but they in some cases take up too much room.






An eraser. You can buy these in rectangles, modeling clay like grey putty, or in a pen form. Use what ever is easiest for you, but always remember, the size of the container/material the container is made out of can harm the putty erasers. (Example: that fluffy stuff on inside of some pencil cases made by certain brands.)






A sharpener, if you are using wood pencils.Tip: have a sharpener which has a collection container underneath. If you are on a train drawing and it's a carpet floor, the pencil shavings are very annoying for the cleaners. If you do have a sharpener without a collection tin or container underneath, don't buy a putty eraser. The little wood bits break and get into the eraser and ruin it.






If you use different products, add them.







, It could be a makeup case, a pencil tin, a container.. if it fits in most of your bags without getting lost or broken, it works. You could experiment with the container, mainly because one size won't fit everyone.

, Just remember, that it's going into a bag.

Pick a theme.,
Find a good jar.,
Gather your supplies.,
Position your figurine.,
Let it dry.,
Fill the jar with water.,
Add the glycerin.,
Pour in some glitter.,
Seal the lid.,
Shake it up.",How to Make a Snow Globe With a Jar," If you want it to be Christmas-related, a snowman or pine tree might work. If it's for a birthday, try a small toy. For a personalized snow globe, try a heavily laminated photo, glued to a cork or another base.Make sure your figure is waterproof and fits on the jar lid and inside the jar. Ensure there's a good flat surface to glue down.Ceramic or plastic are good bets. If you're not sure, place your figurine in a bowl of water for a few hours and see if anything happens.
You can also make your own figure out of sculpey clay. It's easy to find in craft stores and comes in a variety of colors.;
, Any size can work, from a baby food jar to a spaghetti sauce jar to a large mason jar. Make sure there are no cracks and that it can be closed tightly.


Test out the seal on your jar ahead of time. Fill it with water, close it tightly and turn it over—nothing should leak out.
Wash your jar with hot, soapy water, remove any labels or glue remaining, and make sure it's totally dry before proceeding.
You'll also need a place your craft can dry overnight, undisturbed.
Once you've got a figure and a jar, try placing it in different positions to figure out what looks best and which side you should glue down., Most craft stores or general retailers will have anything you don't already have at home. Besides a jar and a figurine, you'll also need:


Waterproof craft glue or epoxy
Glitter or fake snow
Bottled water, which is less likely to cloud up
Glycerin or baby oil (optional, but it thickens the water and makes the “snow” fall more slowly)

, Remove the lid from your jar and find out where you want to place your figurine. Model it in different positions and try the jar over top. Once you have found the right pose, apply your adhesive sealant to the bottom of the figurine. Then, press the figurine down onto the lid, and hold it for about 2-5 seconds depending on the size.

, It could take up to 24 hours, but check your glue packaging for drying times. Find a place to set it where it won't be disturbed. Make sure the figurine on your lid is nice and secure before proceeding.

, Bottled water is ideal and will be clearer. Leave a little room at the top for glycerin, glitter and space for your figurine.

, Use a few drops to about a teaspoon, depending on how big your jar is. Glycerin is optional, but will let your glitter or ""snow"" fall down more slowly. Baby oil should accomplish the same thing., Using plastic glitter, sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons into the water. You may want to use more for a bigger jar, but don't overdo it or your snow globe will look hazy. Use a long-handled spoon to mix well. , Keeping the glass jar right side up, just place your lid onto the top of the jar, and seal it. If there's any extra water, it might leak a little, but that's okay. Turn it over gently and see if there are any leaks. Check for extra space at the top, too, and turn the jar back over and add a little more water if needed.


Let it sit for a few days to make sure there are no slow leaks or problems. Once you're sure everything is good, you may want to glue your jar shut permanently with epoxy or hot glue.

, Shake your snow globe gently and enjoy your lovely craft! Display it on a windowsill, bookshelf or anywhere else you'd like to show off your handiwork.

Clean your vase.,
Protect the inside of your vase with newspaper and painter's tape.,
Paint your vase with flat, white spray paint.,
Let the paint dry completely.,
Measure and cut the holographic vinyl.,
Start applying the vinyl to the vase.,
Continue applying the vinyl to the vase.,
Trim off the excess vinyl from the top and sides of your vase.,
Use the vase.",How to Make a Holographic Vase1," Choose a vase with straight walls. Wash it with soap and water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. Wipe it down with rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils that might prevent the paint and vinyl from sticking.


From now on, try to hold the vase only from the inside.
Avoid using ""bell-shaped"" vases. It will be difficult to wrap the vinyl around them.;
, Tear off a strip of painter's tape, and apply it to the inside rim of your vase. Stuff the vase with scrunched up newspaper.You will be painting your vase to help the colors show up better. If you want a translucent vase instead, you can skip this step., This will make your vase opaque and help the color show up better. Apply the paint using 2 to 3 thin, even coats; let each coat dry first before applying the next.Applying the paint in lots of thin layers will help reduce drips and puddles.
If you want a translucent vase instead, you can skip this step.

, This should only take about 20 minutes, but you might want to refer to the label on your paint can. Once the paint is dry, you can remove the painter's tape and newspaper.

, Measure the height and circumference of your vase. Draw a rectangle on the back of your vinyl, making it slightly bigger than your measurements., Lay the vase down on its side. Peel away some of the backing from the vinyl, and press it down onto the side of your vase., Working a little bit at a time, continue peeling the backing away from the vinyl and pressing the vinyl onto the vase. Smooth out any air bubbles as you go.

, Keeping the vase down on its side, use a craft blade to cut the excess vinyl from the top and bottom edges. Discard the excess vinyl., If you have not already, remove the painter's tape and newspaper. Fill the vase with water, then add some flowers into it. You can also use it to hold fake flowers instead.

Stretch before driving and during breaks.,
Grip the steering wheel loosely and with your arms relaxed.,
Relax an arm every 15 to 20 minutes during long drives.,
Avoid reaching awkwardly for things.,
Take a break every hour.",How to Prevent Arm Pain While Driving a Car1," Stretching your muscles before driving will improve circulation and flexibility. You should stretch your back as well as your arms, since back strain and misalignment can cause arm pain.Stretch your hands by extending your fingers and holding them outstretched for 10 seconds. Relax them, then bend your fingers at the knuckles, hold for 10 seconds, and repeat the sequence.Hold your hands palm to palm in front of you in a praying pose. Keeping your palms together and elbows up, more your hands downward and hold for 10 seconds. Return to the praying position and, with your palms still together, point your fingers to the left and right.Inhale and extend your arms up and around you as far as possible to trace an imaginary circle around yourself. Exhale and trace the imaginary circle downward to bring your arms back to your sides.
While standing, bend over to reach for your toes to stretch your lower back. Count to 10 as you hold the stretch. Bend your knees slightly if necessary.;
, Use a loose grip on the steering wheel, and change your grip frequently. Move your fingers around to keep your hands and wrists from cramping. Your arms should be relaxed with your shoulders and upper arms by your sides and your elbows slightly bent.Avoid locking your elbows or gripping the steering wheel with tense, fully extended arms.

, It’s safest to keep both hands on the steering wheel at all times. However, if you’re on a long drive and can safely do so, take 30 seconds to relax one arm. Hold it by your side completely relaxed, then rest the other arm for 30 seconds at the next safe opportunity.


A low-traffic area with minimal turns would be a good opportunity to rest an arm for at least 30 seconds. If your route has a lot of traffic and turns, you should keep both hands on the wheel.

, Place mints, tissues, sunglasses, or any other items you anticipate needing within a foot of the driver’s seat. Avoid reaching uncomfortably for the glove compartment or toward the passenger and back seats. Keeping items within easy reach will help prevent awkward reaching that can result in arm pain.Pull over if you need something that’s not easily accessible.

, If you’re on a long drive, avoid forcing yourself to make the trip without taking breaks every hour or so. Give yourself at least an extra half hour so you’ll have time to stop and get out of the car. During your breaks, stretch your arms, hands, and back, and walk around for a few minutes."

Start gluing the tiles to the vase.,
Let the glue dry.,
Fill the gaps in, if desired.,
Let the puff paint or grout dry before using the vase.",How to Make a Holographic Vase2," You can use old, scratched up DVDs that no longer, or you can use blank DVDs instead. You can also use CDs instead, but DVDs seem to be more colorful and holographic., Set the DVD down onto a heat-safe surface, or hold it by the edges. Blow dry the DVD using the hottest setting on you hairdryer for a few minutes., A DVD is composed of two layers with a thin, holographic film in the middle. You want the holographic film to stick to the back/clear layer of the DVD, not the front/decorated part. Work slowly and carefully.The DVD will be hot, so be careful.
Discard the top, colored part of the DVD. Save the bottom part with the holographic film.

, You can cut it into squares, rectangles, triangles, or random pieces. It would be a good idea to have a variety of shapes and sizes, especially if your vase is round., Wash the vase using soap and water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. Wipe down the vase one last time using rubbing alcohol. This will remove any oils that might prevent the glue from sticking.


From now on, try to handle the vase only from the inside.
Square or rectangular vases will be easier to work with than round vases. The shape is entirely up to you, however.

, Your DVD tiles will be a little translucent, so this will help the colors show up better. Apply 2 to 3, thin coats of flat, white spray paint to you vase. Let each layer dry before applying the next. Allow the vase to dry completely before moving on.


For a neater finish, line the rim of your vase with painter's tape, then stuff it with newspaper. Remove both once the vase dries.

, You can use hot glue, but it would be better if you used a glue meant specifically for glass. Start at one end of the vase, and work your way to the other. You can leave small gaps between the tiles, or make them flush against one another.

, How long this takes depends on what type of glue you used. Hot glue sets up very quickly, but many glass glues take much longer.

, This is not necessary, but it will help hide any glue and give you a more mosaic effect. You can fill the gaps in using black or white puff paint/dimensional fabric paint.You can also use grout instead.For a more interesting effect, try silver puff paint/dimensional fabric paint instead.
If you are using grout, be sure to mix it according to the instructions on the package. Apply the grout to the vase, then wipe it off with a damp cloth., Again, how long this takes depends on what you used. Both can take several hours to dry, but some types of grout can take several weeks. Once everything is dry, your holographic vase is ready to use! Fill it with water, then add some freshly-cut flowers into it.

One of the most important things in art is practicing.,
Take a few moments each day to study your surroundings.,
Don't get caught up in the color name game.,
Learn how to obtain the correct colors and their properties accurately.,
Consider investing in better quality art supplies.,
Look at other artists' works.,
Another good idea is to look up tutorials.,
Try out different mediums of art.,
Try using a model when you draw.,
If you're into anime or a similar style, it always helps to try out some realism.,
Don't be afraid to be a rebel.",How to Improve Your Art Skills," You've probably heard it many times already--practice makes perfect. Although you can't reach ""perfect"" in art, practicing drawing everyday will help you improve tons.;
, Look at the face of the person you're talking to. Notice how the light affects where all the shadow goes, and the shape of their features. Observe colors and shadows around you, and take a look at textures or how clothing wrinkles. These things will help you gain a better understanding in how real objects work and are shaped and will come in handy when you're drawing.

, It's easy to forget the oblivious fact that every single blade of grass is not just one specific shade of ""grass green"".Cadmium Red can vary greatly among different medias brands and screen settings.This can also cause different results when mixing colors. Avoid referencing color terms in the dictionary and look at items' colors in person or in photographs/videos.

, The color concepts are very different than in grade school basic art. The basic white and black to get shade and tone has a tendency to alter the color hue and make it dull and false. Blue and yellow depending on many factors will be brown and not always green.

, At least experiment with various brands of the same media at different price ranges. Many art supply shops sell the open stock which is less expensive than entire sets if you're just sampling them. Don't bash the cheaper ones which can perform as well or better than more costly versions.


Get out of the children's art supply section! Those do not in general have the same properties as the more professional or artist versions.

, There are many great artists on deviantART, so feel free to check out that site or create an account. Pay attention to their style of drawing. Take a look at multiple artists too, so you can expand your viewpoint. And if you want, try copying their style for a day to get a good idea on it (just don't claim it as your own unless it actually becomes your style). Also take trips to museums and art exhibits to gain inspiration.

, There are a lot of great tutorials on deviantART on all sorts of things and you're sure to find one that helps. Also consider art books and taking art courses.


Beware of the ""paint or draw by number"" format. It's beneficial when learning new techniques but this copycat system can hinder an artist's individual talent and perspective from being seen in the works that person creates. The great artists of the past and present became famous via uniqueness.

, For example, if you're doing traditional art and mainly use pencil or colored pencil, try out pastels or painting for a new experience. Or try it digitally, as in with a pen tablet (like Wacom tablets) and a paint program for your computer.

, Whether it be a picture in a magazine or a bowl of fruit you set up on your counter. It's good practice and it'll help you improve a lot.

, Anime is a more cartoon-ish style than realism, yes, but realism will give you a better grip on proportions and anatomy, and helps a ton when you're drawing anime. Also, body anatomy is important in not just anime, but every style.

, Artists are very opinionated and even on creating one exact effect, will have opposite ways of achieving it. Think about how Monet painted in more abstract rather than follow the art institutions' realistic approach. Some artists feel the color wheel is useless. Learn the rules and as you master them feel free to break them. Draw and paint only subjects you really are inspired by.

Adjust the seat and steering wheel.,
Use a seat belt shoulder strap cushion.,
Check the power steering fluid.,
Use a car with an automatic transmission.",How to Prevent Arm Pain While Driving a Car2," Position the steering wheel 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) from your breastbone. Adjust your seat so your back comes in complete contact with the seat and headrest. Your seat should be reclined about 100 to 110 degrees.Consult your vehicle’s manual for help adjusting your seat and steering wheel.

, Seatbelts can irritate or constrict your shoulder, causing discomfort. Look for a shoulder cushion online or at your auto store. You can also cut a piece of soft pipe or foam insulation to appropriate size and attach it to the seat belt., Low power steering fluid can make it more difficult to steer your car, which can aggravate hand, wrist, and arm pain. Check, add, or flush your power steering fluid, or bring your car to a mechanic for maintenance.If you suffer significant arm pain and your car doesn’t have power steering, consider getting one that does.

, An automatic transmission reduces the type and number of motions necessary to drive a car. Reducing the frequency and variety of grips and movements will help prevent your arms from getting sore.If you drive a car with a manual transmission, consider getting an automatic.

If your profession involves driving, talk to your employer or union representative. Contact your local jurisdiction’s department of driver services for more information about driver rehabilitation.You can also find resources on the Association for Driver Rehabilitation Specialists website., Ask your primary care doctor to examine the affected area. They can offer pain management tips, a prescription medication, or refer you to a specialist.Check with your insurer to make sure any medication or specialist care is covered and in-network to avoid unexpected medical bills.

, Ask your doctor or specialist if your arm pain indicates any potential muscle, bone, or joint issues. Frequent driving or improper driving habits can result in issues like carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff injuries, repetitive strain injury, or bursitis.Driving can also cause and aggravate arthritis, especially in older adults.
Describe the motions that cause pain, the affected areas, and whether the pain is dull or sharp. Ask your doctor or specialist, “Are my symptoms signs of any chronic disorders? Will medication or physical therapy be effective treatment options?”

, If your pain continues despite adopting ergonomic driving habits, your doctor can recommend a variety of treatments. Common options include anti-inflammatory or anti-pain medication and physical therapy.Depending on the severity of your case, your doctor may also recommend other treatments, such as cortisone injections, steroid injections, or surgery."

Gather speed as you approach the hill so that you will climb more efficiently.,
Downshift into a lower gear if your engine struggles.,
Upshift, where possible, to save gas.,
Downshift on tight uphill turns.,
Use the hand brake when starting from a stop on steep hills.",How to Drive Uphill1," If you have the space to do so, approach the hill in 4th or 5th gear. Give the car about 80% of its full power, and stay in 5th for as long as possible. If you have enough momentum coming up the hill, you may not even need to downshift.Do not go dangerously fast, and be especially cautious if you aren't familiar with the contours of the hill. If you know that there is a sharp turn at the top of the hill, plan accordingly and give a little less gas in anticipation.;
, When you drive uphill, your car needs to supply more power to the wheels to counter the force of gravity pulling it down the slope. If your engine roars and whines, it is struggling, and you're probably in too high of a gear. You may notice that your car slows down dramatically, even though you're in a high gear and you've been applying constant pressure to the gas. The moment you feel that the car is slowing down, shift into the next-lowest gear (probably 3rd or 2nd) and step on the gas pedal.Drive fast enough that your engine can handle 3rd gear—the threshold varies between vehicles, but 30-45 mph should do the trick. Make sure to switch gears quickly to avoid losing momentum.
If the engine is still unable to keep up with the incline, downshift into 2nd gear. In some circumstances with very steep inclines, you may need to shift back down into 1st gear. Be aware that many cars don't downshift very smoothly into 1st gear; if you haven't done it before, you may notice some grinding or jerking when you do this.

, The higher the gear, in theory, the more efficiently your car will run. Upshift to keep gas consumption low, if you can, but make sure that you have enough power to climb the hill.

, You may need extra power to make it through sharp turns when you're driving uphill. Downshift to the appropriate gear—usually 2nd—before you enter the turn. This way, you can power through the turn, if needed, and maintain that power while ascending the hill., The parking brake can keep you from drifting backwards when you start up again. When you're stopped on a hill with the transmission in neutral, pull the handbrake. When the light turns green, step on the clutch. Put the transmission into first gear, then slowly let out the clutch. When the clutch starts to engage, gradually release the parking brake.Since you are using the handbrake, your feet are free to operate the controls that move you up the hill: the clutch and the gas.
You'll need to give the engine a little more gas than usual so that you don't roll backwards. Accelerate steadily, not all at once. If you floor the gas, your car will jerk forward, and you might lurch into the car ahead.

If the ferry company you are traveling with does not allow this, you will have to purchase your ticket at the terminal. Ticket booths will be available. Different booths will sell tickets to different destinations so be sure to read the signs carefully.;
, The line-up will consist of many different lanes. Your ticket will tell you which lane you are to go into. After choosing the correct one, park as close as possible to the vehicle in front of you.

, The wait will be a while and it is not good to continue to release harmful emissions into the environment.

, Follow the vehicles ahead of you onto the ferry. You may need to make a variety of complex and tight turns onto various ramps and overpasses.

, For this reason, it is important to perform a variety of different procedures to be able to escape quickly from your vehicle should it fall off of the ramp.


a) Open all windows as far as possible. Ensure that objects do not blow out. The water pressure will be too strong to open your windows under water. (Although power windows will continue to operate when submerged, the water pressure will be to great for them too function.)
b) Release all seat belts. Although you should wear your seat belt at all times while riding in a moving vehicle, make sure you are not wearing it now as it may take precious seconds to release it should your vehicle fall into the water. Ignore the seat belt warning if it begins to beep.
c) Make sure all doors are unlocked. If the doors of your vehicle lock automatically when you place it in Drive, override this function by pressing the unlock button on the driver's door.

, Make sure step 5 is completed before reaching the final ramp (the one bridging the ferry and the terminal). Continue to follow the direction of the terminal staff.

, The crew will direct you to a parking spot. It is essential that you follow their directions as it is their job to ensure that the weight of all vehicles are distributed evenly throughout the ship. Otherwise, the boat could tip over.

, This will maximize the number of vehicles that can be fit on the ferry.

,, If the crossing gets a bit bumpy, the movement may set off your car alarm, and lead to nuisance and potential embarrassment.

, This will reduce the amount of emissions in the ferry.

Know how to get more power from your car.,
Use a low gear when climbing a long, steep incline.",How to Drive Uphill2," When you drive a car uphill, you need more power than you'd use on a flat road. An automatic transmission will downshift for you when you drive uphill, but you can still make manual adjustments to prevent excessive shifting. Using the D1, D2 or D3 settings will prevent your car from shifting into higher gears, which enables your car's torque to be used more effectively on inclines.


D1 (1st gear only): This may be marked as ""1"" or ""D1"". You can shift into 1st using the same lever that you use to switch between Drive (D), Park (P), and Neutral (N). Use first gear for very steep inclines and low rates of speed. 1st gear is also useful when driving downhill on very steep slopes — it allows you to the engine to help slow your car.
D2 (1st and 2nd gear only): This may be marked as ""2"" or ""D2"". Use a D2 mode on fairly steep inclines, when your engine Use 2nd gear to pick up speed after you have accelerated in 1st gear. 2nd gear allows your car to travel faster than 1st gear.
D3 (1st, 2nd and 3rd gears only): This may be marked as 3 or D3. When your car is is in D3 mode, it will use the first 3 gears only, which can help when you need to travel at a good rate of speed, but the engine lacks enough torque to maintain speed in a higher gear.

, Don't switch into first gear if you're going more than about 10–15 mph (16–24 km/h). Your engine will turn at higher RPM than usual, so make sure you're not over-revving it. A lower gear will actually put less strain on your transmission, ensuring a smoother and safer ride up the hill.


When you climb a steep hill, gravity pulls back on your car and makes the load on the engine much heavier. This pull effects your car in the same way as a heavy load—it raises the base level of engine power required to keep the wheels rolling forward.Using a low gear on a hill keeps your engine running at a higher RPM, which helps generate the power necessary to reach the top without stagnating.

"

Engage the parking brake (handbrake) when you park on a hill, even if the grade is slight.,
When you are parking on an uphill slope, turn your front wheels away from the curb.,
If you are parking on a hill with a manual transmission, leave the car in gear.,
Start a manual transmission on a hill.,
Use more gas when starting on steep hills.,
Start an automatic transmission on a hill.,
Practice parking and starting on hills.",How to Drive Uphill3," You can usually find the parking brake either on the center console of your car (between the driver and front passenger seats) or next to the gas and brake pedals (especially on trucks). Leave the parking brake engaged until you pull back out of the spot.

, Let the car roll slowly backward until the rear part of your curbside front wheel rests against the curb. This way, if the brake disengages, your car will not roll backward—the edge of the street will block the wheels from moving any further.If you park your car facing downhill, turn your front wheels toward the curb. This way, if your car begins to roll down the hill, the front wheels will hit the curb and stop the car before it can descend any further.

, If the parking brake fails, the engine should stop the wheels from turning. This means that if you parked in 1st gear, you should not shift to neutral—you should leave it in 1st.

, Ensure that the handbrake is on, depress the clutch, and shift into 1st gear. Set the gas at around 1500 RPM, and bring the clutch up to the ""biting point"": the hood should lift, slightly, and the RPM should drop off a bit. Once you have set the gas and the bite point, hold your feet steady. Check to make sure that the road is clear of other cars, and use your turn signal if you are on a busy street. Raise the handbrake, press the release button, and disengage the brake very slowly.If the car grumbles or strains, depress the clutch about half an inch. Depressing the clutch all the way can make you miss the biting point.
If the car starts to roll backward: reapply the handbrake and the foot brake, and engage the clutch. Practice these motions until you have full control and can keep the car from rolling backward.
As you gradually release the handbrake, the car should either remain still or slowly move forward. In either case: continue to release the handbrake. Gently apply more gas as you slowly release the clutch.

, The steeper the incline, the more power you will need to get the car rolling forward. If you're driving a manual transmission, release the clutch more slowly on steep hills.

, Start the car with your parking brake engaged so that you don't roll backwards. This is especially important if there is another car parked behind you. Make sure that your wheels are turned away from the curb and into the street. Key the ignition, shift into 1st gear (2nd or Drive will also suffice), and carefully depress the gas to pull out into the street. Straighten your wheels, merge into a lane, and keep your car in a low gear as long as you're on the hill.


If you are on a busy street, make sure that there aren't any cars coming up the hill. If so, make sure to put on your turn signal to show that you intend to pull into the street. Wait for all cars to pass, check your mirrors, and pull out slowly.
Keep your foot brake depressed until you accelerate out of the parking spot. Keep friction on the wheels, then step on the gas quickly so that you don't roll backward into the car behind you.

, Hone your hill skills on a variety of grades—steep hills, gradual hills, everything in between—so that you will be prepared if you unexpectedly need to park on an unfamiliar hill. Try to practice on hills that are relatively free of parked cars and traffic. It may be less stressful to learn the mechanics of hill driving if you don't have to worry about being struck by oncoming traffic.

, You will usually need to schedule the road test within a certain time frame, but the specifics will vary from state to state.


As a general rule, plan to schedule an appointment no earlier than eleven weeks in advance and no later than one week in advance. Understand that in many states, appointments fill up quickly.Note that some scheduling services are only available during certain times of the day. If scheduling by phone, you will only be able to call during normal weekday work hours. If scheduling online, you may not be able to schedule between the hours of 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM.

Pay attention.,
Approach the loading zone.,
Exit the vehicle.,
Inform the valet of any problems with the car.,
Pick up your vehicle.,
Watch for your car.,
Carefully pull away.",How to Use a Parking Valet," The number one reason customers get poor service from a Valet is because they are not paying attention to how the system works. Valet drivers and doormen have 2 objectives, serve you while making a good impression, and moving cars in and out of the loading zone quickly. If they cannot move cars quickly, customers become easily annoyed and upset resulting in a poor first impression of the establishment (for example, a restaurant) and lost tips for the Valet. You may be caught off guard by the rushed nature of the interaction between you and the valet, but this is not to be taken for rudeness. So pay attention to what other people are doing, and what the valets are asking of you. Many times customers are being loaded and unloaded on the curb of a busy street. This requires a lot of focus and attention from the Valet as well as the customer.;
, Drive slowly into the loading zone and stop behind the car in front of you. Do not get out of your car until the Valet opens your door. Many times a valet will want you to pull forward or move to another position in the loading zone before you exit your vehicle. Watch for direction from the Valet.

, It should be the valet's responsibility to open the doors for the female passengers first. However, sometimes time and circumstances do not permit this. Make the judgment yourself about whether it is within the capability of the valet to perform this service. If there is a lot of traffic and only one or two valets, it may not be possible. When you exit the vehicle, listen carefully for instructions from the valet concerning price, closing time, and how to get your vehicle back. These details are very important. Some valet services may close earlier than the restaurant and leave your car somewhere convenient for you to pick up. If you don't listen, you may have to leave your car overnight and pay an extra fee.

, You do not need to include every detail of the vehicle's performance, but if a door only opens a certain way, or the alarm is finicky, most valets appreciate this information.

, Once you are ready for your car, hand your ticket to the valet standing closest to the valet stand (also known as the ""doorman""), or to the Valet who asks for it. Generally, one or two valets run the stand while others retrieve cars. You can slow the process down by giving your ticket to the wrong person. Once again, don't mistake the rushed atmosphere for rudeness. Usually valets are under a lot more pressure when customers are leaving than when they are arriving.

, When you see your car, quickly gather your party and get in. This is the most common time to tip the valet. Valets usually pool their tips and divide them equally. Usually it does not matter who you tip. If you are paying a fee, this usually goes to the Doorman.

, Watch for other traffic as well as valets. Be aware of your surroundings.

Keep the driveway well-lit and unobstructed.,
Keep your car in a locked garage.,
Be careful when warming up your car in cold weather.",How to Avoid Being Carjacked1," ""E"" does not stand for “Enough to get me where I need to go.” Keep your car full of gas and in good working condition. If your car is not tuned up and breaks down, it can make you a sitting duck for carjackers.Check your tires once a month and before you take a trip. Look for wear, damage, or low air.;
, This applies whether you are in your car or not. Make it part of your driving ritual to lock your doors as soon as you get into the car, and as soon as you get out., If you must keep personal property such as a purse or shopping bags in the vehicle, put them in the trunk where they can’t be seen. Never leave money in view inside your car, even if it’s just spare change.While driving, put valuable items on the floor rather than on the seats. They will be less visible in case you need to stop and for some reason can’t put them in the trunk.

, Knowing your neighbors will help you recognize if there is a suspicious vehicle or individual around.If you see an unfamiliar person loitering or a strange vehicle repeatedly cruising in the neighborhood, this is considered a “suspicious activity.” Don’t go home. Report the activity to local police and drive around the block; come back to your driveway when that person has left.Reporting suspicious activity and unusual events or incidents to the authorities can reduce crime and make your community safer.

, Make sure that your driveway and garage have lighting. Don’t keep shrubs or other heavy foliage around your driveway.Keep your driveway lit with traditional ground lighting, solar lighting, hanging lights, or LED lighting along the length of your driveway.If you live in an area with foggy nights, choose lighting that can be seen without decreasing visibility in fog.
Ground lights should be at least a foot apart and staggered somewhat.

, If possible, keep your car parked in your garage and lock the garage door.Having an automatic garage door closed does not necessarily make it thief-proof. Carjackers “fish” garage doors with wire hooks to activate the release mechanisms of automatic garage doors.Block access to the release mechanism inside your garage by making a shield with a piece of plywood fastened to a wood cleat with two brad nails. You can also lock the release mechanism with a twist-tie.
You can use a t-handle or slide lock on your garage door as an extra safety measure. A t-handle lock uses its own key and a slide lock can be used with a padlock., If you need to warm up your car in the wintertime, have a second set of keys so that you can keep the car locked while it’s idling. Carjackers use unlocked, running cars as opportunities to steal vehicles."

Use a bluetooth headset.,
Avoid answering the phone or using it at all while engaged in actual driving.,
Pull over and stop in a safe location.,
Ask a passenger to answer the phone and to relay the conversation to you and answer for you.,
Finish calling or texting prior to getting into the car.,
Let people know that you don't answer or use the cellphone when driving.",How to Use a Cell Phone Safely when Driving," Never directly answer the phone, handle it or fiddle with its dials. Dialing while using a hand-held phone and driving makes you 2.8 times more likely to crash.Speak and listen only using the bluetooth. Use voice-activation rather than having to touch any buttons. Check that this equipment is legal in your jurisdiction.


The safest approach to doing this is to start the call before you set off driving. That way, you don't need to touch any controls to get the call started.;
, Turn your phone off or set it to silent. That way, it cannot distract you at all and you won't feel compelled to answer it if it rings. Whatever it is, it can wait until you've stopped driving.


Never text while driving. Sending a text takes your eyes off the road for four to five seconds, on average.This means that, if you were traveling at 90kmh, you'd travel the length of a rugby (football) field blindfolded.Consider using a text response service.

, If you really must answer or make a call, pull over safely to the side of the road and deal with your call while stationary.


Talking on a cellphone while driving decreases the driving concentration ability of your brain by over 37 percent.Your reaction times slow down too, by fifty percent!Put your phone out of reach. Put it somewhere that will force you to pull over and stop in order to deal with the call rather than continue driving.

, Do not make young children do this, however, as this can be both even more distracting for you and an unfair burden on them.


A passenger can send texts on your behalf, if necessary. Ask the passenger to clarify with the recipient that they are the sender, to discourage more texting.

, If you really need to get through to someone, think ahead and deal with it before driving. Alternatively, talk or text on arrival at your destination.

It can also help to tell the person waiting for a call that you're about to drive and can't answer until the trip has ended.

, The more people are aware that you don't talk and drive or text and drive, tell them. The sooner they know, the sooner they'll accept that they can't expect you to be constantly available by phone and that it's okay to wait to hear from you. This will also help them to copy your example and feel okay that they don't have be available by phone when driving either."

Sit in the driver’s seat and look on the dashboard in front of the steering wheel.Alternately, you might be able to see the VIN easier by standing outside the vehicle and looking through the windshield.

The VIN should have 17 characters if the car was manufactured after 1981. Vehicles manufactured before that date had VINs from 11 to 17 characters.A typical VIN might read 1HGBM22JXMN109186.;
, Pop open the hood and check the front of the engine. Some manufacturers affix a body plate that contains the VIN or a partial VIN (typically the last eight characters). This plate should be attached to the firewall inside the engine compartment., Sometimes, the VIN will appear on the car frame, near the windshield washer container. You should crouch down in front of the car on the driver’s side and check., The VIN sometimes appears underneath the spare tire, which is usually in the trunk.Pick up the tire to check., The VIN should also appear on the Federal Safety Certification Label which is in all new cars. This label should appear on the driver’s side door in the following places:On the driver-side doorpost. With the door open, check the spot where the door latches. It should be near the seatbelt return.
Inside the driver-side doorjamb. Open the door and look straight ahead. The VIN should be inside the doorjamb, where the mirror is located when the door is shut., Crouch down beside the car, near the rear wheel on the driver’s side. Look up into the well, above the tire. The VIN might be located there, inside the wheel well., Call if you’ve looked everywhere but couldn’t find the VIN.Give them the make and model of your car and ask where the VIN is located. They should be able to help."

Plan your routes.,
Avoid trouble spots and driving in unfamiliar areas.,
Take extra care when parking in commercial areas.,
Have a cell phone or radio communication on you at all times.",How to Avoid Being Carjacked2," Decide on your route before you depart on your trip, even if it’s just across town. Asking for directions can tip off a would-be carjacker that you are lost and/or not paying attention to your surroundings. Plan ahead of time which route you will take and any stops you may need to make along the way.Choose the most direct routes possible, and mix up your routine so that you are not a predictable target for criminals., Avoid high crime areas, rural areas with less populated roads, and congested traffic spots.Look for a navigation app with the safety feature of avoiding high crime spots.If you notice a lot of cars in disrepair, graffiti, liquor stores, check-cashing stores, or tire skid marks on the street, you may be in a bad neighborhood., According to the National Crime Victimization survey, 25% of all carjackings happen in parking lots, parking garages or near commercial areas. Park in a spot close to the building’s main entrance and under a lot of light,avoiding areas that are visually obstructed by walls or large plants.Don’t sit in the car and go through receipts or have a conversation on the phone or with your child in the backseat. Get in, lock the doors and go.


Don’t put your seatbelt on while pulling out of a space. If something happens, you may need to get out of your car quickly. Instead, belt yourself as soon as you are out of the space and ready to drive.In parking garages, park close to the exit and back into the space. It’s easier to drive forwards than backwards in an emergency., Keep a GPS system in your car or a GPS app on your phone in case you get lost.Always have a charged cell phone with you. Even if it is not under a service contract, you can still use it to call 911 if necessary.

Don’t turn your attention to a cell phone or radio.Observe 360 degrees around you through your mirrors and windows.Keep distance between your car and the one in front of you. This enables you to get around the car in front of you if it stalls or if someone suspicious approaches your car.Keep about one-half of the length of your vehicle between you and the vehicle ahead of you, so that you can maneuver out if necessary. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to see the rear tires of the vehicle ahead of you.

, Carjackers use a ruse called “The Bump.” They rear-end cars and steal them when the drivers get out to assess the damage and gather information. If your car gets hit from behind, only pull over and get out when you reach a safe, public place.Stay inside your vehicle with the doors locked and windows shut. Signal to the other driver to follow you and drive to the nearest police or fire station. If you see that the other driver is not following you, take note of their license plate number., Placing paper money (real or fake) or even fliers under your windshield wiper is a trick criminals can use to get you out of your car. If you see money on your windshield and exit your vehicle to grab it, a carjacker can rush into your vehicle and actually run you over as well as steal your car., Carjackers try to take advantage of people’s empathy by creating ruses. If someone is flashing their lights and trying to wave you over to the side of the road, or is appearing to be injured from an accident and is soliciting your attention, don’t stop.If someone was trying to signal that there is a problem with your vehicle, keep driving and pull over when you find a safe public place.
If someone appeared to be injured and needed help, call the authorities or go to your nearest police or fire station to tell them what you saw.

, Most attempted or successful carjackings happen within 5 miles of the victim’s place of residence.Carjackers may surveil cars returning to gating communities and trap you in before the gate opens. If you’re returning home to your own residence, wait on the street until the gate is opened if necessary, so that a car cannot pull up behind you and trap you in.If you are visiting someone else’s gated community, call ahead to have the gate opened.

, Keep your head up, ears open, and eyes peeled when you’re returning to your car. Don’t ignore your gut feeling if you sense that something is wrong. If you see someone standing around in the parking lot, or you merely sense something is not right, don’t proceed to your car. Return to a place where people are and ask for a security escort to walk you to your car. If that is not possible, wait for a group of people and walk with them.92% of carjackings happen to victims who are alone.Look under, around and inside your car.Don’t allow children or packages to distract from your alertness. Make it a habit to look around before putting anything or anyone into the car.

, If you must stop at a drive-thru ATM, have your ATM card ready, keep your car in drive, and pull up as close to the ATM as possible. Check your rearview mirror before stopping.Avoid isolated payphones, newspaper machines and parking lots.

, Not all carjackings happen under the cloak of night. In fact, more than half (64%) of daytime carjacking attempts are successful.Be as alert during the daylight as you would be at nighttime.

Feel the VIN plate on the dashboard.,
Check the Federal Safety Certification Label.,
Assess the VIN plate attached to the engine.,
Have a mechanic inspect the car.,
Perform a VIN check.,
Analyze the car’s service report.",How to Find Your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)3," The VIN will either be printed on a plate or on a label. Either should be securely fastened to the dashboard. There also shouldn’t be any scratches on the VIN label or on the surrounding area, such as the windshield or dashboard.Also look for signs that the windshield may have been removed in order to pull off the VIN plate. For example, there may be loose molding or excessive glue on the windshield.

, Federal law requires newer vehicles have a safety label, which should contain the VIN. This label is typically located inside the driver’s side door, and is affixed to the rear or forward door pillar post. It may also be on the door itself. Check for signs the label may have been tampered with:The label should be entirely fastened to the vehicle without any loose corners.
There shouldn’t be any tears or scratches on the label. In particular, pay attention to the VIN.
The label should have a shiny clear coat.
The label should be smooth to the touch, without scratches.
The label shouldn’t be partially obscured with a screw or rust proofing material.
The VIN on the certification label should match the VINs that appear elsewhere on the vehicle.

, Check for signs that the plate has been modified or moved. For example, there may be rivet holes where the plate was fastened. Alternately, you might notice that the plate is much cleaner than the rest of the firewall, which is a sign the plate is fake.Remember to match the VIN on the plate to the VIN that appears on the dashboard.

, A mechanic might be able to spot whether the car is a fake better than you can. For example, the mechanic can easily find the VINs on a car and make sure they are consistent. The mechanic might also be able to tell if the VIN plate or label has been tampered with.If you are buying a used car, always insist on taking it to a mechanic before you make an offer to buy the vehicle.

, Visit the National Insurance Crime Bureau’s website to perform a VIN check. When a car is reported stolen, the VIN will be entered into the database.Some thieves will pull VIN plates and labels from cars that have been junked or stolen. They then attach the plate/label to their stolen car.
Call the police if the VIN shows up in the database.

, You can buy a vehicle’s service report using a company such as Carfax. You’ll order based on the VIN. When you get the report, check to see that the car described in the report matches the car with the VIN.

For example, the service report might describe the car as a 2016 Toyota Accord, but the car you have been looking at is a 2015 Subaru. In this situation, the VIN has been stolen from one car and put on another.

Watch out for suspicious practices.,
Get the vehicle’s VIN.,
Use the VIN to do a lien history check.,
Determine if a lien notice is on a title by mistake.,
Satisfy the lien.,
Receive the lien release.,
Apply in person, if possible, to have the lien removed and the title transferred.",How to Find Liens on Vehicles," When negotiating the purchase of a car, you should be allowed to inspect the vehicle’s title. Titles vary from state to state, but typically they will list information such as:Current owner
Past owner(s), if any
Outstanding liens, if any
Past liens, if any;
, A lien release is an official document or certification that an outstanding lien has been fully satisfied. Depending on the state issuing the vehicle’s title, the lien release may either be noted on the title or in a separate document.Ask to see any lien releases even if the title shows the vehicle has transferred ownership from the lienholder. Vehicles can be sold even with outstanding liens, so you want to make sure that one is lien-free before you buy it.
Any lien release documents should be transferred to you if you purchase the car, so that you can show proof any time it is necessary (such as if you sell the car yourself in the future).

, Reputable dealers and sellers will have all documents completed and ready for you to review, or else will be able to request them. If the seller cannot or will not produce the proper documents, it may be a sign that something is wrong with the car or the sale.


Never buy a vehicle if the seller can’t show you the title in the seller’s name, or can't produce lien releases for any liens listed on the title. The title is proof that the seller owns the vehicle and is permitted to sell it.
If the seller can’t find the title, he or she should be able to request a new one from their department of motor vehicle services (or equivalent).It is the seller’s responsibility to do so. If the seller won’t request a new title, it may be a sign that the title is held by a bank or other lending institution and has an outstanding lien, or that the car is not the seller’s to sell.
You will need the title and for the vehicle to be lien-free so that you can properly insure it, and so that no one requests the remainder of the lien payment from you., Each vehicle has a unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Typically, you can find this number in one or more standard locations, including:The dashboard on the driver’s side. This is the most common location. Normally, the VIN is visible by looking at the dashboard through the bottom corner of a vehicle’s windshield on the driver’s side
Under the hood at the front of the engine.
In the trunk under the spare tire

Older cars (pre 1981) may not have standardized VINs, or any at all.

, The VIN can be used to trace any liens on a vehicle. Motor vehicle services departments in individual states will allow you to search this information by VIN number. In addition, private organizations such as CarFax and CarProof can provide this service.


In many states, you can do an online lien history search on a vehicle by using its VIN.Check the website of your local department of motor vehicle services (or equivalent) to see if this method is available to you.
In other cases, you should be able to do a lien search either by mail or in person at your local tax office or department of motor vehicle services. Contact the relevant office or visit its website for details about applying for a lien search.
Check the websites of private vehicle history services to determine availability in your area.
There may be a fee associated with a lien history search, whether you use a private organization or contact your local department of motor vehicle services.The amount of this fee will depend upon your location.

, Local laws typically require either the lender or buyer to notify a tax office or department of motor vehicle services once a lien has been satisfied. If the car you want to purchase carries a lien notice on its title, even though the seller (or previous owner) has satisfied the lien, then it may be because the tax office/department of motor vehicle services has not been properly notified.


Usually, this problem can be corrected without much hassle by going to the tax office or department of vehicles with the title and certification of lien release.
There may be a fee to correct the title.
If the lien release is lost, you will have to contact the lending institution for a new copy. If the lending institution is out of business, has merged, or does not respond to your request, contact your department of motor vehicle services for more information.
If you have receipts, cancelled checks, or other proof that the lien was satisfied, it will make the process easier.You may also contact an attorney for assistance.

, If you determine that a lien against a vehicle is outstanding, and you still want to purchase the vehicle, then you will need to have the lien removed. Have the seller or whoever owes the lien pay whatever balance remains of the lien before pursuing the official release of the lien.


If you do not properly remove the lien against a vehicle, then you risk having the vehicle repossessed by the lender/creditor.

, Once the lien is satisfied, the lending institution will send a notice (either electronically or by mail, depending upon how the lien was recorded) certifying that the debt has been repaid in full.This certification will be used to clear the title of the document.


In many cases, the lending institution will have a period of time (such as ten days) after the receipt of final payment in which to supply a certification of lien release., Visit your local tax office or motor vehicle services department (depending on your state) and complete an application to have the lien removed from a title. If you apply in person to have the lien removed and the title transferred, and agent will be able to review and make sure all information is correct.You will need to bring documents with you (typically the vehicle’s title and the official release of lien document from the lender).
Normally, there is a fee for this service, which will vary depending upon your location.Your method of removing the lien will also depend on how the lien was recorded. In many cases, liens are recorded on paper, but in others they are recorded electronically.If you are applying to transfer the title by mail, you may have to send old title to the department of motor vehicle services (or equivalent) so that it can issue you a new title showing that you are the owner of the vehicle.Contact your tax office or motor vehicle services department if you’re not sure whether you can apply in person.

Choose a well-lit area


Whether you're parking on the street or in a garage, opt for well-lit areas.,
Stay away from parking lot and garage exits


Thieves are more likely to try to steal cars close to the parking lot or garage exits, because they will have a faster getaway.,
Pay for the monitored lot


Monitored parking lots that are watched by security guards cost a few extra dollars, but thieves will pass them by in favor of less secure vehicles in unmonitored areas.,
Lock all of your doors


Many car thefts happen at home because drivers feel safe parking in their own driveways and leave their car unlocked.,
Invest in an alarm system


Have an alarm system professionally installed in your car that will notify you immediately if your car has been tampered with.,
Keep spare keys somewhere else


Never keep spare keys in the wheel well or under your car.,
Never leave valuables like laptop computers, briefcases, purses, wallets or cell phones in plain sight.,
Take your information with you


Instead of storing your title, insurance information and registration in your glove box, keep them on your person.",How to Avoid Car Theft," Park under garage security lights or street lamps; thieves are less likely to target your vehicle if they can be seen easily and will draw attention to themselves.;
, Try to park in the middle of a row of cars in a heavily trafficked area of the lot or garage. Making sure your car blends in is a good strategy to avoid car theft.







, Avoid auto theft by parking in a lot that has security guards and make sure one will be in attendance the whole time your car is parked there.







, Always lock all the doors of your vehicle, even outside your house.

, Loud alarms will quickly deter car theft, and some systems can be programmed to automatically summon police. Alarm system professionals can also recommend systems to deactivate your car's ignition system, requiring a key or activator to start the vehicle.







, These key holders are convenient, but they make it easy for your car to be stolen inconspicuously. Instead, choose a designated place to keep a spare set of keys and make it known only to family members that drive the car.
Don't put all your valuables in the trunk.Most trunks are very easily accessible.

, These add incentive for a thief to steal your car, so lock them in the trunk or take them with you. If your stereo has a removable face plate, take it with you.

, A car thief checking out your car will be more likely to try to steal it if there are documents in the vehicle that can also let them steal your identity.

Have a few wet rags ready to replace it with; they dry out fairly quickly. A passenger could be in charge of replacing and wetting new cloths.;
, It might feel a little weird, but your body lets out a lot of heat through your feet, so traveling barefoot (or at least with flip flops) will help keep you cool.

, As the moisture evaporates from your hair, your scalp will cool off, bringing down the temperature of your body.

, A 10 pound block of ice on the floorboards under a vent will help cool things down. This hack is derived from what residents in Arizona actually used for car air-conditioning in the 40's and 50's! To prevent leakage of water in your car, rest the ice block in a plastic pan or a baking tin. Opening a window a little will help with air flow.

, Wrap the frozen bottle in a towel and put it behind your neck. Once it thaws, drink the cold water in it to cool off.

, Early morning is often the coolest time of the day, and if you're not on a fixed schedule, plan on doing as much driving as possible before the heat becomes unbearable later in the day. Try to avoid driving home mid-afternoon, to avoid the worst heat of the day.

, This is another step in planning your travel time. Most medium to large sized communities have ""rush hours"", when people are on their way to work, or home afterward. This event may cause you to be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic hardly moving along at all.

, If you drive a north or south direction, tree lined streets and roadways are often shady for much of the day.

, This sounds obvious, and it should be, but sometimes the noise and odors of city driving may tempt you to keep the windows closed. To increase the air circulation:


If you have a fan operated fresh air vent, open it, turn on the fan, and open a rear window enough to draw a draft through your automobile.
Opening the car's sunroof or sliding back window will draw a lot of fresh air, even when you're traveling in traffic that just seems to be creeping along at a snail's pace.

, This can offer a substantial reduction in direct sunlight coming into your car, and also provides some protection for the vinyl interior from UV radiation which can damage your car's upholstery and dashboards. (Note: check with your state to ensure this is legal. Some states in the USA do not allow this practice.)

, There are a number of inexpensive 12 volt fans available at auto parts stores and retailers. They clip on the sun visor or rear view mirror, or stand on the dashboard, and plug into a cigarette lighter plug to move air. Switch this on during driving, to help circulate the air and keep you feeling a little cooler.


Passengers can use a paper or real fan to help circulate air directly around themselves. If the movement distracts you while driving though, ask them to lower the fans or to stop.

, If you have a long commute to work or school, try to drive in short pants and a T-shirt, then change in a restroom or locker room at work. Doing this will leave you cleaner and cooler for the day ahead.


It's recommended that you always keep clean, fresh clothes in the car for times when the heat and traffic are too much for you, if there is a chance you will need to be more presentable during the day.

, The darker the clothes the more heat sucks into your shirt; so wear a light colored shirt.

, This allows the hot air to bubble out of the car, thus pulling in cooler air. Sure, the air outside might be 100 degrees, but the air inside a parked car can get to 120+ degrees! Not only does the air get super heated, but the seats and surfaces do, too. But keeping a flow of cooler air helps keep the whole cabin more tolerable. Be sure to use common sense when doing this. Watch for rain.

, Keep the lid open and place it in the unused seat or on the floor. The Ice melts and gives away the chillness to the atmosphere inside the car. You need more ice cubes if travel time is more."

Be original.",How to Build a Rat Rod," Visit a local junkyard to check out the oldest cars that are still intact, which might make good candidates. Several Rat-Rodding websites also exist with links to possibilities.Look for one that is not especially rusted, and has its essential shape is still intact. Typically, Rats are made from American cars, often pick-ups, manufactured pre-1960. Popular models for Rat Rods include:


Mid-century Chevrolet pick-up trucks
'30s-era Fords, esp. the ""Model A""
Early Chrysler hemi engines are popular, as well as flathead V-8s;
, To strip it down and start fresh, that means you'll need to remove all the seats, fixtures and other accessories from the car. Typically, cars used for Rat Rods are in pretty bad shape to begin with, in terms of the interior, making this step somewhat necessary.

, Position a container under the drain cock, or remove one of the fuel lines and collect any gas remaining in the gas tank. This is an essential step in prepping the car for Rodding, as you're going to be doing a lot of welding and any remaining traces of gasoline will be dangerous. Keep a fire extinguisher ready in your shop or garage at all times while you're working.

, Measure and mark where you want the vehicle's new axles and wheels to go, then cut the frame up to the desired length using a reciprocating saw. Since a Rat Rod is mostly about the look of the car, you'll mostly be flying by the seat of your pants anyway.


It's usually common to shorten the rear of the vehicle somewhat to accommodate the axle and eliminate any elements, such as roofs or hoods, that you no longer want. Make any cuts to accommodate the drivetrain.

, It's also possible to build your own frame, using about 20 feet (6.1 m) of rectangular 2x4 steel tubing in the early stages, cut into two equal sections. Weld them together, patterned like a ladder, as square and as level as possible. Use one cross member toward the front, one in the back, and a crossing pattern in the middle to support the body. Match the width of the frame to the body you intend to use.

, Among Rat-Rodders, it's a common goal to try to keep the total price-tag somewhere under $3,000 as a badge of your ability to work with limited materials. If you're up for a challenge, put your skills and your resourcefulness to the test and try to keep the project as cheap as possible by scrounging for a mishmash of parts in the junkyard, or on eBay., You can customize your suspension using the latest in modern suspension technology, making the Rat a hybrid of old and new. Having a Model A that turns on a rail? Yes, please.


Start by measuring the rear width or rear body width and finding axles of the appropriate size. The axle should be somewhat longer than the width, and Leaf Spring rear axles are typically popular options because of their possibility for modification. Anything from the 60s and 70s is also popular, depending on the price.
Install coil springs in a side-to-side or parallel pattern by welding the upper mounts on the cross member in the rear and the lower mounts to the axle housing. To keep it cheap, use a straight axle in the front, salvaged or new.
The suspension from a Mustang II/ Pinto, AMC Pacer or Corvair are popular and useful choices, though ready-to-weld suspension kits are also available, sometimes for as little as a few hundred bucks, complete with frame and axle brackets, as well as template guides. It's a good investment, if you need new parts.

, Old truck bodies are by far the most popular choice, but you can also make use of more modern fiberglass, which is forgiving and easy to work with. Customize your body and make the rod you want, cutting it for the crude-style and swagger you want from a good Rat Rod, then weld it to the frame., try to remember: a Rat Rod is a semi-legal and wonky glorified go-kart, so don't break the bank with the drive train. An old Chevy 350 or a Ford 302 are both super-common and usually-cheap options that you could get and rebuild however you want. Just get the thing running. The great thing about hot-rodding is that if you want to use an engine that really doesn't fit in the body, there's nothing stopping you from doing it but your own creativity and ingenuity. Make it fit. Leave the hood off and do what you want.


You might consider selling the block from the car you got initially, especially if the heads are worn out, then using the extra money you got from the sale to get something from the same era that actually runs.
Install any new starters or alternators as you install the engine into the frame. Make sure you have removed as much grease as you can from the engine before installing, then install the transmission and mount the drive shaft and the radiator. Hook up the steering linkage and install the pedals, welding any additional joints that will be necessary to keep the thing together.

, You'll be close to running at this point, but you'll still need to install the brakes and tires to try to make the Rod as safe as possible. It might not be street legal, eventually, but you'll have to make the thing stop. Put in a seat, or cut up a couch and use something bootleg and hilarious. Rat Rods are amenable to any weird ideas you've got about cars aesthetically. Have fun with it!

, Rat Rods will often go without typical car accessories. Windows, covered seats, and even doors are purely optional. Keep your tools handy so that you can continue to tweak your rat rod even after you've taken it out for its first ride. Customize it creatively.

, Some Rat Rodders like to leave the rusty exterior basically as-is, to show how tough and lasting the original was and remains to be. If you want a slightly more polished look, but want to retain some of the grit, go for a matte base coat with some brownish spray highlights that might resemble rust, but also seal the exterior and protect it some.

, Popular at parades and fairs, Rat Rods styled with unique themes will often draw a crowd. Using unusual objects instead of a steering wheel, for example, might be a fun project that'll get people chuckling. Check out other Rat Rods for inspiration and do something unique and fun to make it worth your while.

, Unlike hot rods, rat rods are customized cars that are not meant to resemble an antiquated original. Spice up your vehicle with odd adjustments and a colorful body, or dramatically alter the original frame to create an entirely new shape.

Check your antennae.",How to Make a Crystal Radio,", Use a felt pen and ruler to draw the 6-by-6 squares on the foil before cutting them out., Start about a half an inch up from the bottom of the tube. Wrap the foil around the tube and fasten it with masking tape.

If you don’t have masking tape, you can use any other type of tape as long as it isn’t electrically conductive. Electrical tape is another safe bet.

, The paper should measure 7 inches by 7 inches, and the foil square should sit right in the center or it, so that it looks like a silver square inside of a white one.

Use masking tape to fasten the foil square to the white paper. Tape all around the foil square to ensure it sits smoothly against the paper.

, Wrap the square around the roll with the aluminum side facing out, and tape it to create a tube. The paper-foil square should form a tube that’s slightly larger than the paper towel roll.

The fit should be snug, but not so snug that you can’t easily move the paper towel roll in and out of the paper-foil tube.
Be sure to have the aluminum foil facing out, so that the paper touches the roll. You want to insulate the two foil squares from each other, so make sure they don’t touch.

, You can use an X-ACTO blade to gently cut around and strip the insulation from the wire. Be sure that you don’t damage the bare wire.

If you have them, you can also use wire strippers to strip the insulation from the wire.

, Take the bare ends of both pieces of wire and bend them at 90-degree angles. This should be easy to do with just your fingers., Tape one of the bare wire ends to the top corner of the free-moving free-moving aluminum foil/paper tube (the one that you’ve placed over the paper towel tube).

Use a few pieces of tape to ensure that the wire is well-attached to the foil. It must touch the foil, as that is what will conduct electricity.

, Tape the bare end of the other one-foot length of wire to the top corner of the foil square that’s on the paper towel tube.

The wires should sit across from one another, so that you could draw a line between them, along the length of the tube.

, Now that your capacitor is complete, you can move on to making your coils.,, Make sure it has no glue or left-over bits of toilet paper stuck to it before you begin., Place one piece of tape along the length of the toilet paper roll, and then cover that piece of tape with another piece of tape. The second piece of tape should exactly cover the first one.

Let a piece of the second piece of tape hang over the end of the roll, as you’ll need to lift this back up as you add wire to your coils.

, Leave a foot-long piece of wire sticking out from each end of each coil. These should be at both the top and bottom of each coil. These pieces are what you will use to connect the coil to other wires.

You’ll have 4 one-foot-long pieces of wire sticking out in total: one at the top and bottom of each of the two coils.

, Peel back the second layer of masking tape and place a piece of wire beneath it, then close the tape over it to anchor the wire there. Wind the wire around the toilet paper roll 25 times, being sure to make tight, close winds.

Don't forget to leave a foot-long piece of wire at both the start and finish of your coil.
Enamelled wires are ideal for the coils because their coating is easier to remove once they’re coiled, and you will need to remove some of the coating in order for the tuning bar to work with the coil (we’ll come to this later).

, Lift up the second strip of tape, place the wire beneath it, and place tape back down to fasten the wire there. Be sure to leave a foot of wire free when you cut the end of the coil., Lift up the tape and place another piece of wire beneath it, roughly 1/8th of an inch down from the end of the primary coil. Fasten the wire to the roll by closing the tape over it, and then wrap the wire 90 times around the roll.

As with the primary, 25-turn coil, make sure that the wire is wrapped in tight, close turns.
90 turns will work out to roughly 42 feet of wire.

, Lift up the second layer of tape and secure the final turn of wire beneath it. Clip the wire off, leaving a foot of wire free.

Don’t forget to leave a foot of wire on each end of the coil for connecting to other wires.

, You only need to sand a small amount of the surface — roughly a half inch to an inch at the top of the coil will do.

Be very gentle and be careful not to sand between the wires. Sanding between the wires will cause them to short into each other, and will make your coil ineffective.

, Each coil will have a foot of wire hanging from its top and bottom. Remove the enamel/insulation from these ends so that you can connect them with other wires.

If the wires are enamelled, you can sand them, scrape them, or dip them in nail polish remover to bare them.

,, Take the two pieces of wood that are roughly 1.5 inches wide by 6 or more inches long, and screw them together to form an L shape.

These pieces of wood do not have to be the exact same length. Many people use scrap wood to construct the base, so if you have other sizes lying around, you are welcome to use those.
Just make sure that the piece of wood on which you’ll mount the capacitor is small enough to fit inside the capacitor.

, Place the base down flat in front of you. Use screws to fasten the holder to the top right corner of the base, on the longer side (so if the base is 8 by 12 inches, do this on the corner edge of the 12-inch side).

The bottom of the L should be lined up with, and perpendicular to, the right end of the base. The top of the L (the longer side of the L) should be parallel with the base.
Once fastened, it should look like a rectangle with one invisible side, or like a horizontal toilet paper roll holder, which is essentially what it is.

, Ensure that the movable paper-foil tube side is facing outward so that you can easily adjust the size (volume) of the capacitor. Use a thumbtack to fasten the other (paper towel roll) side of the capacitor to the mount., It should sit on the right side of the base, across from the capacitor mount, roughly 3 or 4 inches in from the right end of the base.

Leave room (2.5 to 3 inches at least) between the tuning bar mount and the capacitor. You’ll be placing the toilet paper roll double-coil in this space.
If the base’s bottom is quite thick, you can use strong glue to connect the tuning bar mount to the base instead of screws.

, Cut a thin strip of metal and bend it lengthwise so that it makes a V shape. Keep the last half-inch or so of the tuning bar flat. This is the side that you’ll attach to the mount.

The bottom point of the V is what you’ll place on the secondary coil in order to tune your radio.

, Puncture the flat end of the tuning bar and use a screw to attach it to the end of the mount that’s closest to the capacitor mount.

Be sure to firmly but gently screw the tuning bar in so that you can still move it around. Make sure it’s not too lose, as you'll be tuning the radio with it and need it to stay where you put it.

, Exactly where you place the coil will depend on the length of the tuning bar. Place the coil at a distance from the tuning bar that allows the bar to sit on top of the coil.

You need to be able to move the tuning bar back and forth over the secondary coil, much like a windshield wiper moves across a car window.
You can use masking tape to fasten the coil to the base. Just place a strip on the inside of either side of the coil and connect it to the base.

,, To connect wires to each other, twist the bare (uninsulated) parts together tightly. If you have several wires to connect, do the same as you would with one wire, but with all of them.

You can do them one at a time or take all the wires you need and twist them all together at once, whichever you find easiest.

, You’ll need to connect a bare part of your wire to a piece of clean, bare metal that goes down to the ground. Common sources of this include cold water pipes, faucets, and steel support beams.

If you use pipes, go close to the wall to find ones that aren’t insulated or enamelled. You may have to scratch them up a bit to bare some metal and make the pipes more conductive.

, This will be connected to the adjustable side of the capacitor, as well as the wires coming from the right ends of the 25- and 90-turn coils. So keep that in mind while placing it on the base., Loosen the screw holding the tuning bar to its mount, wrap the bare end of a wire around the screw, and then gently retighten the screw. Make sure that the wire touches the tuning bar.

Both ends of this wire need to be bare, as they will conduct energy from the tuning bar to the ground wire.

, Twist them all together tightly.

Wire on the adjustable paper-foil side of the capacitor (should be on the left side of the base)
Wire on the right (bottom) end of the primary, 25-turn coil
Wire on the right (bottom) end of the secondary, 90-turn coil
Wire attached to the tuning bar

, It will be connected to the top (left end) of the primary, 25-turn coil, so keep that in mind while placing the antenna on the base.

The antenna can be any wire, insulated or bare, although insulated is recommended.
Most important is that the antennae is as high and long as possible, and that it is not grounded (i.e. connected to any ground sources such as basement floors or pipes).

, Twist the two wires together tightly., You can do this with masking tape. Ensure that the grey stripe on the diode is facing up and outwards, towards the edge of the base instead of the coils.

Make sure the diode’s wires are sticking out from under the tape, as you’ll be connecting them to other wires.
Place the diode in line with the right end of the capacitor (the paper towel side that can’t be extended), as this is the wire you’ll be attaching it to.

, These wires will attach to the side of the diode that doesn’t have the grey line on it:

Wire on the right (unmovable) side of the capacitor
Wire from the top, left side of the secondary, 90-turn coil

, Attach one wire of the earpiece to the ground wire grouping, and the other end of the earpiece to the wire of the diode that remains free (i.e. the one that isn’t already attached to the 90-turn coil and the capacitor).

You’ll be attaching the earpiece to the side of the diode that has the grey line closer to it.

, You will likely need to adjust the tuning wand and capacitor before you hear anything. Start with adjusting the wand, and then gently pull out the paper-foil side of the capacitor to increase the volume., If you over-sand your tuning coil it could cause each wire turn to become electrically connected, which will cause the coil to be ineffective. Remember to be careful when sanding the coils that you only lightly sand the surface, not between the coils., Depending on what material you’re using, your tuning bar could have a coating on it that prevents it from being conductive. If you’re having trouble picking up anything when you test your radio, try sanding the bottom point of the tuning bar, where it would hit the coil, to make it more conductive., Another possibility if your radio isn’t working is that your ground is not of a high enough quality. Try a different pipe in the house — make sure it extends to the ground.

Good grounds include a steel rod for your house wiring (check below your electric meter and ask an experienced adult to connect this), a cold water pipe, sink faucet as long as piping is metal, or a steel beam house support.Decent but less effective grounds include a heating or air-conditioner register, metal window frame, a longer 20-foot ground wire laid on the floor, or a ground wire wrapped around a metal drain pipe or water pipe., The most effective antennae would be a wire run out an upper floor window to a nearby tree branch — the higher and longer your wire is, the better.Other suitable choices include a wire run along the floor of an upper floor room or hallway, or a wire run along a basement ceiling.Avoid running your antennae along basement floor or inside any metal buildings. This would work well for a ground, but not for an antennae."

",How to Find the Digital Mode of PSK31 on the Amateur Radio Bands," PSK 31 stands for phase shift keying. The 31 is the bandwidth in Hertz (31.25 Hz to be precise) of the transmitted signal. The mode can be found on all amateur bands but the most popular seems to be on 20 metres at 14.070 Megahertz. An appealing aspect is that high power is not needed or encouraged. The author uses 40 Watts and a dipole antenna. Here is what is needed to start a digital station:

An amateur radio capable of all bands.;
, This is needed to connect either a desktop or a laptop's sound card to your amateur radio. There are many different models of interfaces available from RigBlaster, MFJ and others., The sound card is probably the most important part because the software you will be using uses the computer's sound card to transmit the necessary tones to send and receive PSK 31 messages., There are many freeware programs on the internet. The most popular are DigiPan 2.1; and HamScope. There are payware programs with more modes and features for very little money. For example, there is MixW 2.19 and other software.,"

Choose a radio tuned to UHF frequencies.,
Turn on the radio and choose a channel.,
Push the transmission button to talk.,
Follow proper radio etiquette.,
Find out if you need a license for some channels.,
Avoid channels that require a license.,
Avoid reserved channels.,
Put in a privacy code when public channels are full.",How to Use a UHF Radio," UHF is a large band from 300 MHz to 3 GHz, but specific frequencies in it are available for public use, depending on where you live. Check the labeling on the packaging before purchase. UHF devices, including handheld radios, will automatically be set to use this frequency. Larger radios may be able to reach frequencies outside the UHF band.In America, Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) channels exist between frequencies 462-467 MHz.In Australia and New Zealand, the Citizen’s Band Radio (CB) is between 476.4250–477.4125 MHz.If necessary, you can get an antenna compatible with those frequencies. Find them online or at electronics stores.;
, Turn the tuner dial on your radio. You’ll have to tune into a specific frequency to use it. The UHF channels are 12 kH apart from each other and can be found by gradually adjusting your dial. Your device might instead have buttons to flip up and down channels. The UHF frequency is divided into 80 channels, depending on your area.The GMRS channels exist on many of the same frequencies as free FRS channels, but you need a radio capable of GMRS. GMRS requires a license to use.
For example, tune into 462.5625, (channel one) for a shared FRS/GMRS channel.

, Anyone who has seen a walkie talkie will have an idea of how to operate UHF radio. Press down the transmission button. Speak into the speaker, which can be found on the face of a handheld radio. On larger radios, use the handheld microphone attached to the radio by cord. When you speak, your voice will be sent out on the channel you’ve chosen. Anyone tuned to that channel will hear. By letting go of the button, your radio stops transmitting., A large part of etiquette is being polite. Don’t interrupt others unless you have an emergency. Invent a unique call sign, which can be anything you want besides your name. Use call signs to respond to others and state yours every ten minutes or so to check if your radio is still in range of others. Keep your sentences clear and to the point.Use “clear” or “over and out” when your conversation is finished to indicate that others can use the channel.
Learn other radio commands such as “break, break, break” for an emergency. Learn the international alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.) as well for spelling out words, which will help in an emergency.
Some stations are reserved for specific uses. In Australia and New Zealand, channel 11 is for establishing contact with someone. Once you reach them, move to another channel.

, Check your government’s rules before using the radio. Currently, in America, you need an FCC-issued license to utilize GMRS channels 1-7. These channels use radios that operate on half a watt of power or more, which gives them additional range. Some areas may charge for radio usage by businesses or have other requirements.Using channels 1-7 is commonly a problem for dual FRS/GMRS radios. When you flip to channels 8-14, your radio will work under the half a watt limit. Stick to those channels for license-free usage.

, In America, channels 1-7 are currently reserved for licensed GMRS transmissions. Channels 8-14 are free FRS channels for civilian use. 15-22 are shared between GMRS and FRS.Under Australian and New Zealand’s CB system, you do not need a license.

, Some channels are designated to serve specific functions. Others are frequented by local groups of people and are better avoided if you wish to keep your conversations more individual and private. Check the area for channel usages.

For example, in Australia and New Zealand, 5 and 35 are used for emergencies. In America, some areas may use 9.CB radio users also tend to keep 1-8 open for ranged communication, 10 for clubs and park guests, 11 for locating someone else, and 40 for truckers., Privacy codes are useful when public channels are too busy. Your radio may have a setting that allows you to choose a code, such as a second channel input button. Set your channel first before picking a code. When you set a code, your radio will tune out all the chatter on that channel besides that from people using the same code.Different manufacturers have different codes. For example, Motorola uses codes 1-38, all leading to different frequencies.Privacy channels aren’t private. Anyone who is on the standard channel you chose will hear you. You won’t hear them because they aren’t using the privacy code.

Once you find a car that you are ready to purchase, talk to your parents.,
Receive the keys and drive off in your new car!",How to Choose the Perfect First Car," Let them know that you're serious about wanting a car and speak with them about options and finances. Are you going to inherit mom's old van, or are you going to get a new (or new to you) vehicle?;
, If your parents want you to pay for a portion of the car, insurance or gas, come up with a plan to cover these expenses. Some parents decide to meet their child halfway with the cost, so you'll need to figure out how much you need to pay. Babysitting, dog walking, tutoring, and simple chores are easy ways to raise funds.

, Before you get on the topic of new vs. used, you need to research cars. Look everywhere. Look for the car brand on the Internet, and look at all of the models and features each one comes with. Some of the most popular brands for new drivers are Toyota, Ford, Honda, and Chevrolet.

, Every driver is different. Do you want a car with good gas mileage, an odometer with low miles, a sunroof, or a back up camera? Do you want a compact car, midsize sedan, or pickup truck? Write down the features that are important for you and the ones that you would like. Using your list, it will be easier to narrow down between brands and models.

, Once you have an idea of what brand you would like, you need to see the car up close. Car dealerships often put their inventory of new and used vehicles online. Talk with your parents and write down the stock numbers of these vehicles so once you arrive at the dealership, they can find them quickly.

, If you are purchasing a used car, ask the dealership if they can provide you with the car history. You need to know the miles, how many owners, and if the car has had any wrecks or recalls. If they don't have the history, walk away. It may be cheaper, but being sure that the car is reliable will save you much more money in the long run.

, You can find the most beautiful car in the world, but it may not run. Make sure the car is up to your standards by test driving it. Some dealerships will not let minors drive their vehicles, so it's a better idea to let Mom or Dad take over. Test the brakes, turning signals, and how long it takes for a vehicle to get to a certain speed.

, Tell your parent that this car is the car for you. Sometimes it is best to take a day to sleep on it just to be sure that this is really what you want, and not just excitement. When you are certain, have your parent do the wheeling and dealing. Parents have better credit, and are better negotiators than teenagers. Let your parent discuss the financial aspect with the salesman, even if you are purchasing the car.

, Congratulations on your new ride!

Choose between an automatic or manual.,
Decide on a car once you've narrowed down the options.,
Go and buy the car.",How to Choose the Best Car for Your Teenager," Ask them, what kind of car do you feel would be the most practical fit for your needs? Try to have them focus on small, compact cars (but not too small). Sure, they may want to start with the fancy convertible or the huge pickup truck, but make it clear to your teen that they should be fairly open minded. This is their first car!;
, Consider the most durable and reliable car brands before your favorites, as these types of vehicles have a wide variety of capabilities so your teen can handle any situation that may arise. Thoroughly read car reviews posted by real drivers (not paid car enthusiasts) to get the most accurate impressions.

, Usually, you'll be able to find a similar model from a different year, which will generally look almost the same and may only be missing a few negligible features. Of course, you can visit any auto dealership if you want your teenager to have a brand-new car, but the best deals are on used cars.

, Some parents prefer that their teenage drivers know how to work both types, but remember, there are good and bad aspects to both. With a manual, you have to take the time to learn how to shift gears, and they have to take their hands off the wheel to shift. Are you going to teach them? Also, it's easy for a new driver to burn out the clutch, and, depending on the car, that could cost you $1,500 or more.

, Make sure to involve not just you and your teenage driver, but the whole family for their collective input. If it helps, write down a list of the pros and cons of each car on your list and go over each one.

, Make your teen happy! Remember, this means that now, they get to pay for the insurance and gas. Your part is done. Oh, and, say goodbye to late night driving them home from parties or friend's houses!

Ask yourself three questions to narrow down your choices and find the one car you’re looking for.,
Ask yourself what kind of car you want.,
Ask yourself what you need by way of performance, space, etc.,
Ask yourself who will be your passengers.,
Check your budget.,
Consider fuel efficiency.,
Decide on new or used.,
Make use of car review websites.,
Wait before buying.,
Make an Excel spreadsheet covering all the things that matter to you.,
Check with family members who might be using the car.",How to Choose the Right Car for You," This section details each question.;
, According to car experts, considering what you like and dislike can help to narrow down your choices. For instance, if you like sports car, then look for sports car. There’s no need to waste your time and energy searching for SUV’s, etc.

, in the car. If you like a sports car but this sports car will not fit your needs, scratch the sports car. If you are planning on building a big family, opt for bigger cars unless of course if you have the money to afford to buy many cars, then it would be fine.


If you are a construction worker and need space to transport logs and huge pieces of wood and stuff, then a pickup truck will be right for you.

, This is especially important for those who have a big family who have kids with them on car seats. More space is needed if you are carrying your whole family with you so a car with more space inside is preferable.


If only you are going to drive that car, and you are not going to transport more than one person somewhere, a two-seater should be fine. Consider, however, that a smallish back seat adds little or nothing to the cost and fuel consumption of the car, allows the passenger seat to recline more, and greatly increases cargo capacity (sometimes with the seats dropping and connecting to the trunk). A two-seater is more for extreme compactness, style and handling than lack of need of a rear seat.
If you usually transport 3-4 people but don't need that much trunk space, a compact to mid-size should be fine.
If you usually transport around 4 people and need lots of trunk space, then you should get a full-size sedan, a minivan, or an SUV. A minivan is roomiest of these and more efficient than the SUV; some have a stretched nose to look less minivan like. A full-size sedan is most comfortable, particularly a factory-stretched long-wheelbase version such as a Lincoln Town Car Executive L or Signature L, and often designed for strenuous limousine service. An SUV often has four wheel drive and is good, at low speed, for poor road conditions.
If you have a large family and/or regularly transport about 5-6 people, get a van or minivan. A minivan can be safer in that it has a low center of gravity almost like a car.

, Before going to the showrooms for test drives and car checks, have a primary budget in mind. This will help you to remain reasonable about the choices and not give in to a car you really cannot afford. If you're on a Suzuki or Hyundai budget, it'll help you not to tiptoe toward an Audi or Mercedes.

, If you need a fuel-efficient car, a hybrid will be right for you. You'll want to consider however whether it is worth it or not. If you have a commute longer than thirty miles to work daily, or if you spend a great deal of a short commute in traffic every morning, then hybrids are a great option versus economy sized four cylinder cars. Extra cylinders and displacement greatly decrease fuel economy overall, and extra frontal area greatly decreases fuel economy at speed. A long, low car such as a big sedan or wagon with a relatively small, cheap engine can be stylish, comfortable and safe.


For a personal, urban car, petrol or gas is best over diesel.

, This can be directed by your budget and also your common sense. In some cases, used cars offer better value but they do require careful checking by an expert, especially to certify that the car hasn't experienced an accident, or has been properly repaired if it has been in one.

, Checking a relevant local car review website (or several) will give you the lowdown on the features, appearance, performance stats and other vital information. You'll be able to see what other people and experts have been thinking about the cars in question and also see what potential issues there might be.


Reviews from owners are more realistic and honest than those from the salesroom are likely to be. You'll learn the disadvantages as much as the advantages.

, If the car has only just been released, avoid being an early adopter. Wait for a few months or so to see what happens to its on-road value and to read reviews from the owners.

, Add in the information gleaned from the website searches too. You will be able to see, at a glance, what the benefits and drawbacks of each car type is.

, They'll have their own ideas and preferences to take into account too, especially if the car is to be shared and driven by more than just you.

Make sure that the car is on level ground before checking it out.,
Carefully check the paint job of the car, taking note of any rust spots, dents or scratches.,
Check the trunk of the car to make sure it is still in good condition.,
Check the tires.,
Never buy a frame damaged car.,
Try to get under the car when it is safely raised and inspect the exhaust system or any under-body rust.,
Check under the hood of the car for any indication of dents, damage or rust.,
Check the hoses and belts.,
Inspect the engine for any sort of leaks, or corrosion.,
Remove the oil filler cap.,
Pull the transmission dipstick; the fluid should be pink or red.,
Check the timing belt.,
Go inside the car.,
Check to make sure the air-conditioning of the car is working well by turning it on.,
Check the odometer of the car for the mileage.,
Find out if the car has a computer on board.,
Verify the lights and all the regular functions of the car when not moving.,
Test drive the car before making any final decisions.,
Be sure to check the brakes of the car by pressing down hard enough on the brakes to decelerate rapidly, but not enough to slide.,
Check for small trepidation at 45 / 55 / 65 / 75 mph (121 km/h).,
Check for sounds, trepidation or clunking noise when making a 90 degree turn.,
Check out the car's service history which should give you some information regarding the performances, repairs, and problems of the car.,
Bring someone who knows cars.,
Do not pay sticker price.,
Bring a pen, paper and cell phone with you are purchasing from a private sale.",How to Check out a Used Car Before Buying It," This is to ensure that you will be able to clearly check the tires and to see if there is anything sagging on the car.;
, The car should be clean so the paint condition is visible. Look at the sides of the car from end-on for waviness; that indicates paint work. Run your finger along the edges of the joints between panels; roughness indicates residue left from masking tape.

, It should not show any sign of rust, or water entry due to cracks or holes. Wear inside of the trunk indicates usage of the car.

, The tires should be worn evenly and they should match. Look at the surface of the tire for feathering (bad alignment). Bad alignment can be caused by worn steering/suspension components, the pothole down the street or frame damage.

, Check the saddle (connects the front fenders and holds the top of the radiator). It may be welded or bolted in. Inspect the bolt heads at the top of the fenders inside the hood; scratch marks indicates that the fenders have been replaced or realigned (after a crash).

, Look for any black spots on the exhaust system because this can indicate leaking. This is also a good time to inspect for frame or unibody damage.


Check the exhaust with your finger. Greasy grime means important problem. Turn the car on. White vapor (not in a cold climate) is a bad sign too.

, These can all be signs that the car was either poorly taken care of or damaged. Each fender, just inside where the hood joins, should have a decal with the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) of the car. If the decal is not there, it does not necessarily indicate the fender was replaced; the location of the VIN is manufacture-dependent.

, They should not have cracks. The radiator hoses should not be soft.

, On the engine block, look for any dark brown oil stains, this will indicate that there is a leak in a gasket, and could possibly lead to an expensive repair in the future. Check the brake fluid, and reservoir to make sure its is not leaking. The belts should look new (i.e. not have cracks or signs of drying). Old belts can snap, and if you do not know how to replace them, it will cost between $100 – $500 depending on which belt goes bad.

, A foam residue on the inside indicates a leaking head gasket. Forget that car.

, An old car may be dark but it should not look or smell burnt. It should also be full (check with the engine running).

, This is the most important belt in the engine, and is also the most costly to replace. If the car is equipped with a steel timing chain, you don't have to worry about this. Normal lifespan of a timing belt is from 60 – 100+ thousand miles; this depends on the manufacturer.

, Check the seats and upholstery of the car for any tears, rips, stains, or other type of damage.

, If air conditioning is a must, buy a car with R134 coolant. Most cars fitted with R134 are 1993 or newer and have a sticker on the AC Condenser.

, This is important because the mileage indicates the car’s age. On the average, a normal driver will drive between 10,000 to 15,000 miles (16,000 to 24,000 km) a year; however, this depends on many factors. Remember, cars age by time and mileage. Buying a 10 year old car with very low miles is not necessarily a good thing.

, Bring with you an inexpensive computer to check for errors. At any auto store they have inexpensive devices with prices around $150. However, most cheaper generic code readers are fairly limited in what they can access.


For a car that has an on board computer, pay attention to the warnings right when you start the car or when you turn the key or the start button.







, This includes: any sensors for parking, back parking camera, radio, CD, music installation, etc.

, This is perhaps one of the best ways to know the condition of the car. Hence, a buyer should make all effort to do a test drive first before coming to any decisions.

, Try this going around 30 mph (48 km/h) in an area without traffic. You should not feel any vibration from the brake pedal, or hear any squealing or strange noises. Brakes that pulsate indicate the need for having the rotors resurfaced or replaced and new pads installed. It should not swerve; this can be caused by a bad brake caliper or worn steering components.

, Slight trepidation during a small speed interval may mean wear at the direction mechanical parts which may cost between 400 to 1500 to repair. These may include joints / arms etc. This may go together with uneven wear at the front tire(s).

, Do this at low speed. This means again, wear at the front direction level: joints need to be changed.

, Ideally, the current owner would have kept a record of the times when the car needed servicing and should be willing to show you this information. Some cars do not have maintenance records because they maintained them at home. This should be fine as long as they can prove they maintained the car properly. There are instances where used cars are sold because of past accidents or negative experiences.

, It is a good idea to bring along a trusted friend with a good background of automotive know-how to check things that you are not sure of. If you do not have a trusted friend in the auto industry you can pay a mechanic to complete an inspection on it for around 75 – 100 bucks. Make sure this mechanic has good reviews so you will not get scammed into thinking the car is a lemon.

, A used car is a negotiable item. Do not feel the need to pay the price they are asking. The dealer bought this car at a low price, and is turning around and selling it for much more than they purchased it with the notion that they might have to lower that sticker price. Depending on the quality of the vehicle, feel free to offer a price. Be sure that it is a reasonable offer. If the dealer is asking $15,000, do not offer $10,000. It is merely an insult by doing this. If the car is over $10,000, try to negotiate at least $1,500 off of the car. You can pre-qualify yourself at your bank or at a Credit Union. That will determine what you can spend for a car. Try to buy a car that is less than they tell you. Most people try to buy more car than they can really afford. Remember, no matter how good that car is today, it is going to require maintenance in the future.


Use parts of the car that are unflattering to your advantage. If a car is not the color you are looking for, tell the dealer ""I really like the car, but I don't like that it is green, that is the only thing holding me back from buying it."" The dealer will see that you want it, and find some way to get you into that car.

, As you make your inspection of the car be sure to record all items which are damaged or will require replacement. If needed also remind the buyer that you will be taking the vehicle to your own personal mechanic so they do not think the list is for theirs. After you have collected a list of what you believe the car will require you can telephone auto parts stores to check the price and availability of replacement parts. Once you know how much the car will cost to repair if you buy it you can make an informed decision on what you would like to pay as well as increase the likelihood that the seller may reduce their asking price.


Be careful while doing this because some sellers may think it's rude by doing this. He may decide not to sell to you.

Research the different types of BMWs.,
Be aware of potential depreciation with a used BMW.,
Know about the costs of maintaining a used BMW.,
Read about the potential issues with each model car.",How to Buy a Used BMW Car1," Make sure you know all the different models, so you know what you’re looking for when you get to the dealership.BMW 1 Series is a rear-wheel drive four-seat car. The 1 Series is best for consumers who are looking for a small, fast luxury vehicle.
For the best-selling BMW car, you’ll want to look for the 3 Series. This is also a small car, but it comes in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive. You can a get a sedan (E90), wagon (E91), coupe (E92), and convertible (E93). This is also a high powered vehicle, but is also known for handling well. If you're looking for something cheaper, consider the older (E46) coupe or cabriolet.
The BMW 5 Series is a mid-size sedan that is mostly known as a luxury vehicle. It is available in all-wheel drive. Some even have diesel engines and save costs in fuel consumption, although exhaust parts may need to be replaced more often
For the largest sized vehicle, you’ll want to look for the BMW 7 Series, which is a luxury sedan that comes with leather seats and often wood trim. This is a made for people who can be driven around by say a chauffeur, otherwise don't waste your cash on it
Based on the Series 3, the BMW X3 is a small SUV that has a lot of space for hauling whatever you wish. It works well if you have a small family and ""occasionally"" need to tug a giant amount of items
The most expensive BMW (Besides the 7 series) is the BMW X5. It’s the largest SUV and can be pricey to maintain as well as buy. Be careful of the X5s as they are greatly unreliable and costs start and go upward of $5000;
, BMWs are great cars, but they lose value quickly. This can especially be a problem if you plan on reselling your used BMW later on.BMWs do not maintain their value for long. With each passing year, your car loses value at a larger rate than other similarly priced luxury vehicles.
Some BMWs don’t depreciate as quickly as others. While the 7 Series depreciates especially quickly, the 1 Series and X5 do not. Keep this in mind when choosing the model of BMW you want to purchase.High depreciation cars can also mean that you can find an older BMW for less. The difference between a 3- and 6-year old BMW can be rather large.

, BMWs can be expensive to maintain, because of general upkeep, as well as costly repairs and issues with reliability.BMWs are expensive to maintain. They require higher quality gasoline, oil, and tires than many other vehicles. Additionally, the labor costs for BMWS are usually higher because of the way they’re engineered. This can be avoided by going to second or even third hand repair centres. If the BMW is made before 1999, the car can be serviced by any mechanic specialized, non-specialized or even by the owner (you).
Repairs for BMW can be pricey. It’s not hard to find a shop that specializes in these vehicles, but in their Vehicle Monitoring Systems. Local dealerships are usually expensive for repairs, so having a BMW-specialized repair store near you is important for keeping costs down.
While BMWS are (for exception of BMW X5s) generally reliable, they do occasionally need repairs. Some of their reliability issues are due to the use of plastic parts and the expensive electronics that make up the interior of the car.

, Certain BMW models are known for having common problems. Make sure you know any specific problems with your model. Some of the most common problems for BMWs include:Electrical issues. The BMW has many complex electronics both inside and outside the vehicle. BMWs occasionally have issues with the battery, fuses, and the key control system. Additionally, some internal electronics like power windows and power steering are problematic in BMWs. As mentioned earlier most of these systems are managed and controlled by the vehicles iDrive System
Engine issues. Since many of the BMWs have turbocharged engines, engine problems are common with these cars. Some issues including stalling, difficulty while idling, and a rough ride. On an Second-Generation X5s, the engine replacements can cost around $50,000
Rattles. BMWs can have strange noises coming from inside or outside the vehicle. These may simply be annoying, but they could also indicate a problem with the vehicle.

Get a vehicle history report.,
Pay attention to any red flags on the vehicle history report.,
Read the vehicle’s warranty.,
Bring a mechanic to look at the car.",How to Buy a Used BMW Car2," A vehicle history report will tell you about the vehicle’s past owner, accidents, service, warranties, and potential liens. This report is usually verified by law enforcement, so it can be trusted as a good source of information.Find the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the car. If you’re looking for the VIN, it’s usually outside the windshield on the bottom right facing out or inside the driver’s side door on the jamb.Look online for a place to get a free vehicle history report. There are plenty of places online that offer them for free; however, these reports won’t always indicate the accident or lien history.
Pay for vehicle history reports that offer all of the vehicle’s history. You may have to pay money to get a report that includes a total history of the car. It is worth it, though, in case there are any red flags when looking through the vehicle history report.

, The vehicle history report will give you a lot of information. However, there a few important things to look for that may be red flags if you’re buying a used BMW.Look for any tampering with the odometer. If the mileage on the vehicle history report does not match that on the car, the odometer has been tampered with and you should walk away from the car.
Check for failed emissions reports. If you live in an area with emissions standards (Such as California), you’ll have to get this fixed for your used car. Verify that all repairs have been done if you see evidence the vehicle has failed emissions tests in the past.
Beware of any major accidents. Even if the car looks fine now, it’s possible that major accidents have cracked the frame or caused other permanent damage.
Look for any vehicle damage, due to flooding. Flood damage to engines can be hard to find, but very expensive to fix.
Check for any irregularities in the vehicle history report. If anything looks unusual or fake on a vehicle history report, it may have been tampered with. Always order your own and don’t rely on individuals you may be purchasing a car from to produce one.

, Many used cars will still be under some form of warranty. Make sure the warranty covers all major issues. If not, consider extending the warranty if possible.Many BMW warranties cover the car for six years or 100,000 miles. This will cover the car for things like defects, but not for general maintenance and upkeep.Look for any handling charges on the warranty. These may amount to roughly $50 per visit in the event of any repair while the car is under warranty.
Check for a certified pre-owned warranty. Certified pre-owned warranty are warranties for used cars that have been verified to be in excellent shape. Read all the fine print if the used BMW has one, since some of these warranties are not transferrable to new owners., Your used BMW should be thoroughly inspected before you start negotiating to buy it. Have a third-party mechanic look at the car, since it’s better to have someone external to your purchase verify that the car is in good shape.Talk to a mechanic you can trust. If you have a regular mechanic that you’ve built a relationship with, this is the best person to check out your new BMW.
Have the mechanic look over the car for major issues. This should take about an hour, so it may cost around $100 to complete.
Inspectors can spot major issues that are not noticeable to the naked eye, such as poor repair work, flood damage, or frame damage. While some of this may come up in the vehicle history report, a good mechanic can verify any of these issues as well.

Look up the true market value of the car.,
Pay attention to the four prices listed under the used car's true market value.,
Make a plan of what you’re willing to spend on your used BMW.,
Be realistic about the deal you’re getting.",How to Buy a Used BMW Car3," True market value tells you what people are currently paying for your used BMW. It is based on what dealers are actually selling the car for and is averaged from a number of dealers throughout the country.Go to a reputable website that verifies used car pricing. You should be able to find a number of pricing tools online easily.
Websites displaying true market value will also display the invoice price of the car. This is what the dealership actually paid for it, which will be lower than the value or price of the car.
You can also find the sticker price or the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). This will often be more expensive, since cars rarely go for their sticker price.

, You'll find listings for trade-in, private party, dealer retail, and certified used vehicles. These listings will all be different prices, so use the appropriate listing for your purchasing situation.Trade-in value is what dealers are usually paying consumers when customers trade in their vehicle. If your used BMW is a recently trade-in, then this is likely about what a dealership paid for it.
Private party is how much the car is selling if you're buying it from someone rather than a dealership. This may be more or less than the trade-in value, depending on the year or condition of the vehicle.
Dealer retail is roughly what this car is selling for at dealerships. When buying at a dealership, this is about what you should expect the car to be listed at.
Certified used vehicle is the value if it has a certified used warranty. It has greater guarantees, so can be more expensive.

, Before going to the dealership, write down how much you're willing to spend. Stick to your number as best as you can. If the car is still too expensive, there's nothing wrong with walking away.


Come into the situation with a clear price in mind. Know what you can (and are willing) to pay for your used BMW.
Start off by offering a one step below the true market value for the car. BMWs are popular, so probably only one step is advisable.
Used the best negotiating tactics. Don't make any rash decisions while you're there.

, If a deal for a used BMW is too good to be true, it may very well be.While we all love bargains, do remember that there is no such thing as ""cheap BMW in excellent condition.""


Buying the cheapest used BMW may not give you the best value for your money. Your goal should be to find a reasonably priced used BMW in good shape.
BMWs that are too good of a deal may have some issues. Have a reliable vehicle history report and a mechanic look over the car thoroughly if the price seems too good to be true.
If they are asking for less than the car is worth, you definitely need to be suspicious. It's possible the car has major liens against it or it could even be stolen.

Your property tax assessed value. Look at your most recent property tax statement.
Comparable sales. Check websites such as Zillow and see how much similar homes have sold for in your neighborhood. The sales should be recent (past six months), and the homes should have the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms.;
, The amount will depend on the value of your home, your mortgage, and your credit history. Generally, you can borrow up to 85% of the value, less your mortgage.For example, your home might be worth $200,000 and your mortgage is $100,000. You can borrow 85% of $200,000 ($170,000), minus your mortgage. In total, you can borrow $70,000.
You might not have enough equity in your home, in which case you won’t be able to get a HELOC.

, A lender will want to see that the total amount of your mortgage, including insurance, taxes, and HELOC payment, is no more than 28% of your gross monthly income. All of your debt payments should be below 36% of your gross monthly income., Shopping for a HELOC is a lot like shopping for your initial mortgage.You should visit several banks and credit unions so you will have a range of offers to choose from. Usually, credit unions offer better deals than banks, so make sure to stop at a couple.


You can also contact your mortgage lender, though you are not required to get your HELOC from them.Try to apply for all loans during a 14-day period. Each credit inquiry will hurt your credit score, but all inquiries made in a two-week window only count as a single credit pull., You want the best deal possible, so don’t immediately sign up with the first bank to make an offer. Instead, compare multiple offers based on the following criteria:


The draw period. This is the period when you can take money on the line of credit. During this period, you typically pay only interest. Many draw periods last four to six years.
The repayment period. Once the draw period ends, you start paying down the principal on the amount you borrowed. For example, you might have 10 years to pay off the loan.Interest rates. These usually fluctuate with a HELOC. However, some lenders might offer fixed interest rates.Fees. Your fees should be lower than what you paid for your original mortgage.
Closing costs. You’ll need to pay for your appraisal, attorney’s fees, and other fees at closing.

, The application process is simpler than when you got your mortgage. You will probably need to provide the following information with your application:Property information, such as the purchase date and purchase price
Your contact information
Your personal information (Social Security Number, marital status, date of birth, etc.)
Proof of employment and income, such as W-2 forms and recent pay stubs
Copies of bank statements

, It typically takes only a couple months for the lender to decide whether to give you a HELOC.Once approved, you’ll be given a credit card or a check book you can use to draw money from the line of credit. Now you can go car shopping!

, If you don’t know what you want, search the inventory at different dealerships in your area. They should have their inventory listed on a website. You can also search for used cars on eBay, Craigslist, Autotrader.com, and Cars.com., You want to see the car’s vehicle history report, so you can find out if it has been in any accidents. You should also check the car’s fair market value, which you can find at Edmunds.com or Kelley Blue Book.


Remember to test drive the vehicle.You don’t need to buy a car if it doesn’t handle well.

, Let the dealer know you have financing in the form of a home equity credit line. Some dealerships might not accept this payment, so find out ahead of time., Because you already have financing, you should be able to get a good deal.Based on your research, settle on an amount you are willing to pay. Open the negotiations by offering an amount that is 10-15% less.


Remember to play dealers against each other. You might have found a similar vehicle for a much cheaper price across town, so don’t hide that fact. Make them compete for your business, and walk away if a dealer can’t meet your target price.
Always remind the dealer that the amount you are offering includes a decent profit for the dealership.Many dealers like to claim you’re bankrupting them, which is false.

, Many dealers give you the option of taking rebates or getting 0% financing. Because you have money in hand to buy the car, you can choose the rebates, which should save you money., The registration process varies by location. Contact your Department of Motor Vehicles for details. You’ll need to pay taxes and fees when you register, and you might also need to pass an emissions or smog test.Contact your DMV for a full list of requirements.

, With a HELOC, your home secures the loan. If you miss even one monthly payment, your HELOC lender might start a foreclosure proceeding.By contrast, your car loan is secured only by the car, which means you’ll only lose the car if you default.Which do you fear the most—losing your home or losing your car?

, You might save money buying a car with a HELOC, or you might not. You should compare the different amounts that you will spend before going ahead and getting a HELOC.


You can use an online calculator to estimate your monthly payments using a traditional car loan. Look at how much you will pay each month but also over the life of the loan.Use an online calculator to find out how long it will take to pay off a HELOC.However, it’s a little hard to estimate payments with a HELOC, since interest rates can increase in the future.

, Generally, you can deduct the interest you pay on a home equity line of credit from your taxes (so long as you itemize deductions).You can typically deduct up to $100,000 in interest. Consult with a tax professional for more information.

, You might be unhappy with the high interest rates for car loans. Before choosing a HELOC, shop around for different auto loans. Also look at online lenders. Several major banks offer auto loans over the Internet.Your current rates might be high because your credit score isn’t great. This is even more reason not to use a HELOC. If you’ve struggled financially recently, you are at greater risk of defaulting on your HELOC and losing your home. Consider repairing your credit before applying for a car loan.

, You might want to buy a car for a child. However, it’s probably better to cosign on the loan than to use a HELOC. You won’t put your home at risk if for some reason you can’t make payments as a cosigner. At worst, you’ll only lose the car and hurt your credit score, but you'll still have a roof over your head.

, It might be a safer bet to get a smaller or cheaper car with a car loan than to use a HELOC to buy your dream car. Even if you want a luxury car, you might be able to find a used one in good shape that is affordable.

Identify which cars will hold value.",How to Recognize the Best Used Cars," Various companies offer accurate blue book values for used vehicles. Always check a used car deal against the current blue book value according to condition, mileage, features and other aspects of the car that is for sale.;
, Potential buyers often test drive the vehicle, listening for engine sounds, and watching for items like coolant or oil leaks. Sometimes, direct mechanical inspection is necessary. A large part of the used car deal is making sure the vehicle is trouble-free at the time of sale.

, Carfax and similar services offer car history recording in order to show the buyer whether or not the car has been previously wrecked or tampered with.


Inspect the title. Many cars that are previously damaged are required to be issued a new title by the resident state. This title will often include a salvage mark or indication, showing that the vehicle has previous damage from an accident. Buyers most often avoid these deals, as hidden damage can reduce the value of the car.

, One issue with finding the best used cars is figuring out how much the buyer will have to pay in the coming months when it's time for a state safety or emissions inspection. Many sellers offer vehicles with recent inspection in order to put the buyer's mind to rest about a deal.


Inspect tires and other small parts. Part of evaluating inspection and maintenance needs is to look at the current tread on tires, the state of windshield wipers and other parts, and the basic exterior condition of the vehicle.

, The best used cars have good seating and an interior without stains, tears or anything else unsightly.

, A large part of the used car buying process is evaluating brands. From Japanese brands like Toyota to American mainstays Ford and Chevrolet, buyers want to understand which vehicles will have a higher resale value and a higher satisfaction value when they look at the prices that sellers are charging for a particular vehicle.

, After selecting a specific car type, search for sellers that offer used cars for sale. You can consider auctions, private sellers, and used car dealerships as options.

, You can do this by knowing the current value of a car make and model that you are interested in by using the Kelley Blue Book or simply use the Blue Book website. Just make sure to provide the car make and model, the mileage, and the condition of the vehicle in order for the website to generate a certain price. This would serve as your basis when you negotiate with the dealership regarding the car’s price. In case they would charge you with a value higher than what you have obtained using the Blue Book, try to demand for good discounts.

, This could help you recover the money that you paid to the seller in case they sold a defective vehicle to you. Try to acquaint yourself with all the requirements needed to recover what you pay so as to avoid being taken advantaged by dealerships.

Determine what kind of car you are interested in and specify the make and model in the Craigslist search engine.,
Call the number listed with the car you are interested in.,
Ask what state the car is titled and registered in, then type this information into your search engine and select the appropriate state DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) website to see whether there are any special registration requirements in that particular state, such as smog testing, or roadworthy vehicle maintenance requirements.,
Ask the owner if the car has a clean title (meaning that the car is paid off in full and has no liens against it) and what the odometer reading is, currently.,
If the owner has provided you with accurate information up to this point, schedule a time to go and examine the vehicle.,
For your safety and that of the owner, arrange to examine the vehicle in the parking lot of a supermarket or mall.,
If you've noticed no problems with the vehicle while it was being driven, and the owner hasn't added anything under the hood (or otherwise behaved suspiciously) when they got out, approach the owner and introduce yourself.,
If everything appears to be legitimate about the vehicle paperwork and the owner, ask for the keys and begin inspecting the vehicle.,
As you inspect the vehicle, listen to what the owner is telling you.,
If you see no problems with the outer side and underside of the vehicle, take the keys and open each door of the vehicle, trunk and hood included.,
Now that the car has been driven and parked for a few minutes, proceed to the engine compartment and kneel down with your flashlight to look on the ground and underbody of the vehicle for any drips or leaks.,
Ask the owner to drive the vehicle to the service station you've selected to examine the vehicle.,
Talk to your mechanic openly in front of the owner, if possible.,
Take the vehicle for a brief test drive to ensure that everything is in good working order and to your liking.

,
Upon returning, step away from the vehicle and owner with the excuse of making a brief phone call to your spouse or significant other regarding the vehicle.,
If you have the money to make the purchase, finalize the deal and have the owner write you a receipt with his or her signature affixed next to the date.",How to Not Get Scammed on Craigslist when Buying a Used Car," Also select the options for ""By Owner"" and ""Has Title"".;
, Ask if the person you are speaking to is the legal owner of the car and if they currently have the title to it. You need to speak to the owner of the vehicle.

, Ask the owner if they have documentation to prove that their vehicle would pass any such testing requirements as it sits. Ask for the expiration date on their current registration. You need to know if you'll have to shell out additional monies to bring the car up to specifications before you can register it, should you choose to purchase it.

, Open a new browser and select a service record/accident reporting service website. Key in the Vin number and check for any accidents/repairs that might indicate that the car is likely to have serious mechanical or structural problems. Look for a previous ""Salvage"" title on the vehicle and the most recent odometer reading. It is more difficult to register and insure a vehicle with a ""Salvage"" title, and a vehicle with high mileage (high odometer reading) may require more expensive maintenance and repairs in order to get it to, or keep it in roadworthy condition.

, Make sure you see the vehicle during the daytime and can spare up to an hour to examine it yourself, and have a mechanic check it over for you.

, This will afford you the opportunity to arrive early and observe the owner driving the vehicle into the lot. As they arrive, you should be looking for things like: Is there smoke coming from the vehicle? Is the vehicle making any strange knocking or ticking noises? Do the breaks or tires squeal as they turn into a parking space and come to a stop? When the owner turns the vehicle ignition off, does the car immediately stop running, or does it make odd choking/knocking noises? And finally, what does the owner do when they exit the vehicle (assuming they have not seen you yet)? Does he or she wipe down the car to ensure it looks sparkly? Or does the man or woman grab a bottle out of the car and pop the hood to top off fluids?

, Ask to see the title and registration and compare them with any inspection stickers you may find on the windshields of the vehicle. Note any discrepancies and question the owner about them. If in doubt about who the car is titled and registered to, ask for the owner's drivers license and the vehicle insurance paperwork. If there is any discrepancy, regardless of your feelings about the person or vehicle, find another car. The name should be the same (signature included) on each piece of documentation.

, Walk around the vehicle and visually inspect each tire and wheel well. Look for signs of tire weakness or failure. Run your hand over each tire, feeling for uneven tread wear. (this may indicate poor wheel alignment gone unchecked, or worse, a wracked car frame causing uneven contact between the tires and the ground). Stand at the front corner of each side of the vehicle and look down the body for indications of dents or abnormalities in the body that might indicate a previously damaged vehicle. Such indications might include: wavy body panels, inconsistencies in the paint texture or shine, inconsistent rust patterns, or a suddenly way-too-talkative owner. At the front and rear of the vehicle, kneel down and look under the vehicle. At the front, look for a different paint color or overspray consistent with the vehicle paint color. Look at the inside line between the front and back tire on each side of the vehicle for obvious alignment problems or evidence that the car has been in a frame-wracking crash. Make sure all light lenses are in good condition. At the rear of the vehicle, examine the first few inches of the tailpipe with a flashlight. Look for rust or holes, then examine the length of the pipe for defects such as missing clamps, holes, excessive rust. While you're on your knees, examine the entire undercarriage of the vehicle for rust, failing pieces (even if you're unsure what each piece actually is), and deep scrapes or scratches that indicate significant impact against the underside of the vehicle.

, Often, while you're looking closely at their vehicle, an owner who's neglected to mention problems he or she is aware of, will begin acknowledging, or even pointing out indications of an accident, repairs, or damage done to the vehicle, and provide you with details that can help you decide whether the vehicle is a good investment., Upon opening each cabin door, check to ensure that the windows and locks perform properly and that the glass is solid. Inside the driver's side door, on the frame of the vehicle, you should find a sticker with the vehicle's Vin number stamped on it; compare this number with the Vin number the owner has provided you. Examine the interior, and atop and under the seats for rust (a window, windshield or sunroof leak left unrepaired for a period of time will result in rust on the interior fabrics that is difficult to remove. If you see any, feel along the gasket of adjacent windows for signs of weakness or failure). In the trunk, look for signs of rust, loose compartments, missing or damaged spare tire/tire changing equipment.

, If you spot nothing, get up and start your examination under the hood. Look for any visible sign of a bent frame near the grill area, then examine the radiator for damage to the screen or holes. If nothing else of the engine is visible, ask the owner for any repair and maintenance records they might have and where they have their vehicle serviced. Look for indications in the records that the motor or transmission has been changed.

, Follow them to the service center and observe how the car drives and how the owner drives it. If, at leaving red lights, the owner punches it instead of driving normally, make a note to ask your mechanic to check for potential transmission problems. If the owner has to re-start the vehicle at any time during the drive, be wary. Watch for braking problems and steering problems. If the car looks like it is crabbing down the roadway, like the front and back tires are not in a straight line, the car frame needs thorough inspection for significant frame damage.

, Relate what the owner has told you about the vehicle and ask if what he or she sees is consistent with what you've been told. Ask them if they would buy the vehicle for the price the owner is asking, and how much it will likely cost you to make any necessary repairs to the vehicle.

,, Take a moment to gather your thoughts and process what you've heard and seen regarding the vehicle. If, after a few moments, you feel unsure and hesitant, thank the owner and proceed no further. If, on the other hand, you are certain that this is the right car for you, at nearly the right price, return to the owner and make him or her an offer to purchase the vehicle. Use the information you've gained from your examination of the vehicle and your mechanic's advice to negotiate with the owner until you agree on a purchase amount.

, Make sure you have the title to the vehicle signed and dated by the owner and by you before you leave. Under no circumstances should anyone except you drive the vehicle from this moment forward. The owner will need to make arrangements to return him or herself home, but it would be unwise for you to accompany them, or provide them with a ride.

Purchase the best car for your needs.",How to Test Drive a Car," If your normal daily transit mostly entails being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic, it's important that you test your new car under these conditions. Think about your daily driving habits. What kind of driving do you normally do, and how can you simulate that in a test drive?, For example, if you are a horseback riding enthusiast, you might want to pay special attention to the mirror placement, horsepower, and turning capabilities of your prospective car during your test drive.If you have special activities that you'll want to know your car can handle, make a list of these and imagine how you might simulate these conditions.

, You may want to take a test drive in areas with steep grade if you plan on taking your car into nature for camping, hiking, or similar activities. Oftentimes road conditions outside of commonly traveled routes is less maintained, and you'll want to know if your car is up to the challenge., Frequent passengers in and out of your vehicle might mean that an interior with low seats and a well positioned rear-view mirror is ideal for your situation. Also ask yourself, ""Is this car easy to enter and exit?""This question can factor in heavily if you transport children, the elderly, or if you have friends with disabilities.

, The best way for you to most clearly discern the differences between the different models in which you are interested is by driving these cars back to back.This will highlight the finer features between your favorite models that you might have otherwise missed.

, The options and power train of the car that you drive will influence handling significantly. Even something as simple as the trim of your car can create wind resistance that might be undesirable.Write down the primary features of the car that you are considering buying. Trim, transmission, and window control are three features you should stress, as these will greatly influence your driving.

, It's important at this stage that you stress the exact features of the car you wish to drive. Clearly explain that you are only interested in driving a car with those specific features, and book an appointment for your test drive. If you have any special conditions you would like to test, like steep grade driving for mountain driving, mention this as well and see what the person making the appointment has to say., No matter who you are, you likely have some daily supplies, work materials, or maybe even a gym bag that you'll need to stow regularly in your car. It will be inconvenient if you buy a really great car only to find that it won't fit your hockey sticks or golf clubs. Bring any large or irregularly shaped items for a test-stow in addition to your test drive., You'll want to know the service intervals for the vehicle and whether or not the manufacturer recommends premium fuel for the vehicle. You should also inquire about any key features of the car, how well they work, and any ways that you might best utilize these features., Your cell phone might be enough for this purpose, but a pad of paper and a pen might be a less distracting way of jotting down what you like/dislike about the car. This will help you create a pro-con list later if you have two or more contenders for your future vehicle.

, A tactic sometimes used by dealerships to your disadvantage is the holding of an important document or piece of identification under a pretense. Then, while you wait for ""copies"" of your license to be made, or for a secretary to finish ""processing"" your information, the salesperson will often push the sale on you.By photocopying your license front and back beforehand, you can show the salesperson the ID without giving it to him. Provide him your photocopies instead of your real ID.

, As long as the dealer allows this, a friend can be a great ally during your test drive. A friend might notice things that you didn't about the car you are driving, or may have specialized knowledge that can help you make the right decision. Think about asking your friend to help you keep the salesperson occupied. Many times, salespeople will continue trying to sell the car while driving, making it difficult for you to focus on the test drive.

, Especially if you commute, drive the car in both stop-and-go traffic and at freeway speeds. Drivers who frequent the mountains should try to find some steep grades, listening closely to the engine while going up the slope.Even though it might be against your instincts, try to drive over some bumps to see how the car absorbs the shock.
Take tight corners at aggressive (but safe) speeds.

, In a real life emergency situation, you want to know how your breaks will hold up and how the car will respond. While at a safe location, such as an empty parking lot, accelerate and apply the brakes firmly.Take note of how your brake pedal feels. Is it stiff? Are you comfortable with its range and placement?
Do you notice that the brakes catch suddenly and are you comfortable having brakes that do so?, And not just on the driver's side, either. By entering the passenger doors as well, you'll have more complete idea of the comfort of the car and other potential issues, like whether or not it's kid friendly. It's important to ask yourself if you will be able to live with this car for a number of years.

, Taking a car for a test drive is for your benefit, not the salesperson's. If you find yourself distracted by the salesperson while you are taking a car out for a test drive, it's completely alright to say:""I'm sorry, I know you're just trying to do your job, but I'm trying to listen to how the car is running during the test drive. If I have any questions, I'll be sure to ask.""
""Thank you for giving me so much information, but while we have the car on the road, I'd really like to focus on it. We can talk more when we get back to the dealership later.""

, If you drive with the radio on, you might miss something significant or be distracted from noticing a feature that's a deal-breaker.A new car is a big investment, and believe it or not, the songs you hear might influence your opinion of the test drive.This is particularly important if you are test driving a used car, as you will want to spend at least a couple of minutes listening to the engine at different speeds.

, Rust on the frame could be your early indication that the car is structurally unsound or on its way to the junk heap. You should also give the car a complete look over in as bright of daylight as possible.Check under the hood, and look for any leaks or rust.
Are you looking at the car in what you believe is its normal spot? Are there any stains on the cement that might have been caused by the car?
Search for rust in the trunk under the carpet or pad.
Look for rust at the edges of the doors and door hinges.

, If you live in a climate where you will need temperature control, like regions that experience extreme hot or cold temperatures, you will need to test the car with the heat and air conditioning.Some cars' performance is influenced more than others by climate control. Looking this information up online can save you from a nasty surprise in the summer or winter months.

, If you are uneasy about the car or the seller, follow your gut instinct. A vehicle purchase decision is too important, and too expensive, to undertake without total confidence.

, But give yourself time to mull this decision over before you do. A common strategy used by dealers and salespeople is to make you feel like you have to buy in that instant. Don't allow the dealer to pressure you into any decisions; you are the customer, and you are in charge.


Even if you spend hours looking at vehicles at a dealership, you are under no obligation to buy a car from that dealership.

Get a part time/ summer job.,
Save as much as possible.,
Keep track.",How to Save for a New Car1," Part time and summer jobs can be a great way to earn some cash to buy a cheap beginner car. These jobs include: mowing lawns in your neighborhood, raking leaves/ shoveling snow. house sitting, baby sitting, dog sitting/walking are all great opportunities to make some extra cash to have some spending money as well as money to put back towards a car.
, When saving for a car, question every purchase and make sure it isn't a waste of money. It is recommended to start saving around the age of 13 if you have a part time job, or even just get paid to do chores. Instead of spending your allowance, try putting it into a piggy bank or a bank account that you won't touch., Keep a ledger (money log) to make sure you know where all your money is being earned and spent at. This will help you stay motivated to keep saving more money. the more you save the better car you can get (keep in mind that you need a reserve amount of money for gas, insurance, and maintenance on the vehicle.)"

Stick it out with your old car.,
Keep the old care in good condition.,
Keep up the payments.,
Consider opening a separate bank account dedicated to saving for your new car.,
Don't get caught up in the wants of life.",How to Save for a New Car2," The longer you can keep running it, the better. Unless, of course, your old car is costing you more money than what you can afford to put into it.

, Once the car is paid for (60 months on a standard car loan), keep the car in good operating condition and continue to drive it.

, As you commute with your car to work and elsewhere, make sure to keep making your monthly payments into a savings account.


Scenario = If you make 400 dollar monthly payments on your Jeep, and pay it off in 4 years, the Jeep can be driven for at least another year or two. If you continue to make 400 dollar payments to your savings account for 16 months, you will have a total of 6400 dollars to put down towards a new car. You can do this for longer and be able to pay for the new car in full.







, Many employers allow you to control how you want your paychecks deposited. If possible, have your monthly payment direct-deposited into this new account. This ensures that you won't be tempted to use those funds for other expenses throughout the month., Too many times you may feel tempted to buy a new car when your old one is doing just fine. The Beemers and Benzes are nice, but they'll make you broke unless you can afford it.

Figure out exactly what it is you want to buy.,
Hide your enthusiasm.,
Unless its explicitly put in writing, you get about the same protection after the sale from a private seller as you would from a dealer.,
Know how to read a seller that's trying to sell you a lemon.,
Know what to look for on the car itself.,
Drive the car.,
Once you have figured out which car you want for the right price and there are no obvious reasons not to purchase, then share your number with that party (dealer or private seller).",How to Protect Yourself when Purchasing a Car," Whether it's a new or used car, you need to know what you are looking for in advance before going out and looking at the actual vehicle. Do some comparison shopping.


One of the best things to do is start on KellyBlueBook.com to see what the car is actually worth. Use the ""private seller"" option to try to gauge what a fair price would be. Next look around on as many on-line sites that you can think of. Good places to start are Craigslist, Auto-trader, or just your local newspaper online classifieds. Another good source is the completed auctions on eBay.
Remember, somethings is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay so the completed auctions are a good source. Don't let a salesman tell you how much something is worth. If it was worth that much, it would have sold already. Once you have an idea of what you want and what you should expect to pay, its time to go out and actually look and drive vehicles.;
, Your excitement about the car just tells the buyer that you are willing to pay more. This takes some practice but trust me, this is really important. A seller is more willing to negotiate with a ""less motivated"" buyer. They view the excited and giddy customer as a likely impulse buyer and its easy to just wait that buyer out since it's an almost certainty that the impulsive buyer will pay top dollar.


The best thing to do the first time you see a car is to see it, assess it, and walk away. This lets the seller know that you are not desperate and potentially leading to a better deal for you later. Sellers will always try to tell you how this is only a deal for a limited time or that the car will go fast. Don't worry, deals and cars are always available. Don't be a victim of pressure. If you are shopping at a dealer, avoid giving them your number unless you want to be bugged to death over the next few weeks.
The lot salesman will swear he will not share your number with the company but for some reason, you will still end up getting multiple calls from the same establishment. Just keep your number to yourself for now since you will be looking at multiple cars.

, Most dealers sell ""as is"" which means exactly that. If you want any warranties, get it in writing. A handshake and someones word means nothing when your buying a car.

, Nothing can take the place of having the car checked out by a qualified mechanic, which is likely something that you should do before you make a purchase however, there's a few ways to avoid spending a fortune on taking multiple cars to a mechanic by weeding out the lemons first.


A big red flag is the seller that starts telling you about all the new stuff the used car now has on it. Lucky for the smart buyer, the shady salesman always thinks you will be impressed by all this information. They will start telling you about all the new sensors or joints that have been replaced or this pump or that component. Why is this a big red flag? Because that means that this particular car has small, but costly things constantly breaking requiring replacement. This level of indispensability is the likely reason they are selling this particular car in the first place.
The only things that should be truly impressive to you are new tires, brake pads (not other random brake system components), windshield wipers, filters (oil, air, and cabin) and a new battery.

, Have a look at the engine. An engine to look at is one that has not yet been professionally cleaned. Why? This allows you to see any obvious oil leaks and just how old the hoses really are. A freshly power washed engine with polish all over it doesn't have those clues. If it has cleaned, you can still see leaks up close but it may not be as obvious.


Try to look at the car where its normally parked to see if there are oil stains on the ground. Next, look at the condition of the body panels. Does the paint match at all the seams. Make sure you look at it during the day and from multiple angles. Paint that is slightly different on separate panels or doors/hoods/trunks that don't line up perfectly indicates that the car has been in some sort of an accident requiring body work.
You can also see evidence of repairs in the fender wells as well as behind the decorative carpet in the trunk. The ""Bondo"" that is used to smooth out the outside before painting does not hide the underlying creases that the smart buyer finds on the internal parts of the car. This is a good time to mention getting an account to Car Fax or Auto check so you can run the VIN numbers to see the actual number of owners, any accidents or flooding, and more importantly, if the title is ""clear"" and not ""salvage"" or ""rebuilt"".
If you're not familiar with those terms, take some time to look them up on Google but for now, just know that it's bad and best to avoid unless you have a more sophisticated knowledge of cars and are willing to deal with such cars.

, Drive the car with the radio off and the windows up (and then down later on at slow speeds) The car should drive perfect with smooth shifting and no pops or bangs. Don't let anybody try to explain away jerky movements or unusual noises. Usually, they are just trying to dump this car on you because they know there are expensive repairs around the corner. Make sure that its not pulling to one side or the other.


Take notice of how well the interior is maintained. A sloppy worn out interior is usually indicative of an owner that did not do any preventative maintenance such as regular oil changes. Now you can check all the gadgets. The air conditioning should blow cold and hard. Make sure all the power switches work including seats, windows, mirrors, etc.
Everything should work flawlessly. If simple things like windows and seats don't work, it could be a a clue about flooding. To be even more sure, stick you head under the seat and use a flashlight to look at the metal bolts holding down the seats. If you see ANY rust, walk away.

, Be patient. Now its your time to ""feel out"" the seller. If they are calling multiple times, then you are in a good place to negotiate because they are motivated to sell but if you don't hear from them in a couple of days, go ahead and purchase your new used car.

Don’t get stressed out.",How to Negotiate With a Car Salesman," If you wait to get financing through the dealer, then the dealer will have the upperhand in the negotiation. If you come to the lot with financing secured already, you will have that as a tool in your negotiation.


Go to your bank or credit union to apply for an auto loan. You’re likely to get a better deal with lower interest, depending on your credit score and if you already have an established relationship with that bank as a customer.You can even apply for a loan through your bank and get approved, then take the approval to the dealer. They might give you a better deal just to earn your business.;
, If you go to the dealership knowing exactly what you want and how much you can pay for it, you will be less likely to be pressured into paying more or buying something you hadn’t planned on purchasing.


You can use online services to compare different models, upgrades, and prices. If you go into the negotiation knowing what different models go for, you will have the upper hand.

, Use online services like Kelley Blue Book to value the car and see the fair price for that vehicle. By doing this, you will know if the salesperson is trying to overcharge you.If you have your eye on a particular previously owned car, most dealerships will have all the details for it on their website or online inventory. Make sure you take into account model year, mileage, and any upgrades that are on the car when you value it.

, More than likely, a salesperson will approach you right when you enter the car lot. Let them know you are just looking and will tell them if you have any questions.


If you let the salesperson direct your search, he or she might take you towards the more expensive vehicles. Take your time and look at all of the available cars you are interested in.

, It’s common for people to take on an aggressive attitude when car shopping, since they think that this might help them keep the upper hand. But, as a general rule, it is always better to be polite.


Threatening to walk out if you do not get the price you want is not the best route to take. If you are rude to them, they will be more likely to be rude in response.Keep in mind that these salespeople deal with a good amount of rude and aggressive people on a daily basis. If you are the one kind, amiable person they talk to that day, they may be even more likely to do something kind for you in return—like give you a better deal., Even if you are planning on trading in your old car, don’t let the salesperson know this until you have already agreed to the price you want.


Dealers use trade-in values when they price the car. This way, they can make it seem like you are getting a lot more for your car than you really are. If you don’t tell them you have a trade, they won’t factor it into the price they give you., Since the real goal for any salesperson is to sell as many cars as they can, they will want to get you to sign on a deal as quickly as possible so they can move onto the next person. Don’t give into this—take your time.


If the salesperson doesn’t agree to your price, tell them you would like to think about it for a day or two, and leave without signing anything. Within a few days, they might worry you found another deal, and they will follow up with you and possibly offer a better deal., Since most salespeople work on commission, they likely have to meet a certain amount of sales each month. If you go in to negotiate near the end of the month, you might be more likely to get the deal you want, since the salesperson might be eager to meet his or her goal.Additionally, try to shop when new models are being introduced. If a new model and the immediately preceding model are on the lot at the same time, you might be able to negotiate a good price on the older model. This happens because salespeople want to move older models to make room for the newer ones. New models are introduced throughout the year so keep an eye out regularly for new cars.
The same goes for shopping at the end of the year. You might notice that many dealers have big end-of-year sales, as they want to clear the lot of the previous year’s models to make room for the new ones. Because of this, you might get a better deal when purchasing a car they are trying to get rid of., If you start out way too low, the salesperson might just write you off. Start at a price lower than your target, so that as you move through negotiations, you might land on that target.If the initial asking price on the car is $25,000 and you offer $10,000, that would be too low. If your target price is $23,000, offer somewhere between $20k-$22k to start with.

, Ask the dealer for the CarFax report for any used vehicle you are considering. This report details all owners, accidents, and even if it once was a rental car, which could lower its value. When you get a CarFax report, make sure the vehicle identification number (VIN) on the report matches the VIN on the car.


Getting a CarFax report yourself can cost almost $40, so it would be better to ask for one from the dealer., There are online services such as Kelley Blue Book and AutoTrader that will help you get a good picture of the value of the specific car you want. This way, you will know if the salesperson is trying to overcharge you.


AutoTrader will help you figure out how much that specific car is going for in your area. Prices can fluctuate based on where you are, and how many cars of that kind are for sale in your area., If you want certain maintenance or repairs done to it as a condition of purchasing it, hold fast to these demands as well. Don’t settle for anything less than what you want.For example, if you notice the car needs new tires, you might negotiate a set of tires into the cost of the car. Or, you might ask that the car be tuned up or given an oil change prior to the sale.

, These extras can be anything from dealer warranties to detailing to rust prevention. It’s likely the dealer will charge more for these services than if you purchase them elsewhere.


If the salesperson offers a detailing service, for example, you might end up paying less for that same service if you had it done somewhere else after you purchase the vehicle. Make sure you find out what exactly is being included in the total cost of your used vehicle.
In general, avoid purchasing extended warranties and other extras. Consumer experts tend to agree that these additions are not worth the money. Instead of buying extended warranties, buy a reliable car and take care of it., After two years, a car’s value decreases by almost half of its original value, so you can usually get a pretty good bargain on these cars.


If you stay around the 2-year-old mark, the mileage will likely still be pretty low, and the car may not have had or need many repairs yet., If you enter the car lot and find that the salesperson you end up working with is not right for you, you can walk away. You want to make a deal with someone you are comfortable with, and who is willing to work with you.This is another instance where patience is important. If you don’t find the right dealership or salesperson on the first try, there are plenty of other salespeople and dealerships for you to try.

, It’s easy to get emotional in the car buying process. Try not to get emotionally attached to a particular car or deal, and try not to allow the salesperson to manipulate your emotions.


Salespeople know how to appeal to your emotions. Make sure you keep yourself grounded and level-headed as you test drive vehicles, and don’t let the salesperson talk you into falling in love with a certain car or deal., You have your budget and what you want in mind, so don’t let a salesperson talk you out of it or convince you to pay more. Be firm about your budget and what you are willing to pay for the car you want.


It might be difficult to stand your ground when you know that budging even a little could get you the car you want. But, if you overcommit in terms of payments and price, you will regret it.

, Buying a car can easily become a stressful experience. Instead of getting overwhelmed, take a step back if you need to. Take your time and remind yourself that you don’t need to rush.


If a salesperson is pressuring you and making you feel rushed or uncomfortable, politely leave the situation. Let them know you aren’t ready to make a purchase just yet.

Don't go into a deal without the facts. You should know how much the value of the car is before setting foot on the showroom floor. Or, if you are purchasing a used car, you should know how much the car is worth for the features it has and the shape it is in. There are web sites, such as Edmunds.com and KBB.com, that allow you to type in all of the details of the car in order to get an appropriate value.





;
,


Cars, just like anything, have peaks and lulls in sales. It is important to know if cars are selling for more or less than their market value when you are ready to negotiate a purchase. Looking at several lots and web sites for similar cars will help you to get an idea of the current prices.







,


When deciding how much you can afford to offer, consider how much you will be able to shave off the price if you are trading in another vehicle. Know before venturing into the deal what the market value is of your current vehicle.







,


Cars are priced with negotiating in mind. Even if it is just by a few hundred dollars, every seller expects to be bargained with. Don't be afraid to be firm from the beginning about what you want to pay for the vehicle.







,


When you say you are making your final offer, mean it is your final offer. If the seller still comes back at a higher price than you ultimately want to pay, walk away. They will almost always come around and meet your price (as long as it is within reason) if they realize you are serious about walking away from the deal.







,


Be sure you are aware of all of the extra fees that are associated with purchasing a car as you make your offer. Between insurance, monthly payments, and your loan interest rate, it is important you know exactly what you are signing for. For example, the number of months your loan is for is more important than the amount of your monthly payment, because ultimately you will just be paying more for longer. Scour the details before the agreement is finalized.

Follow up during bad weather.",How to Negotiate Car Price," By knowing which car you want, you give yourself the opportunity to research which options it comes with and how much the car is really worth. You can visit dealers and take test drives, but don't start any negotiating yet.;
, There are tools you can use to research this for free online. For new cars, check out Edmund's TMV pricing.For used cars, take a look at the Kelley Blue Book price.You can also use online tools such as US News Rankings and Reviews for cars and trucks to get a general idea of pricing from various dealerships in your area.Market value is determined by a number of factors, but essentially, the value is calculated based on the current automobile market as well as the price that dealers around the country are selling a particular car for.
As a safe bet, make your ""target price"" roughly equal to the car's true value. Your target price is not an opening bid; on the contrary, it should be your closing bid, and the price you will not go above.
If you feel a little more daring, you could make your target price $500 to $1000 less than true market value for new cars or 10% to 15% less for used cars. Getting a dealer to settle for this price can be extremely difficult, but it can be done.

, Before stepping foot in any given showroom to start negotiating, place a call to the dealerships in your area and inquire about their asking price for the car you're interested in. Do not mention anything about a trade-in, monthly payments, or financing. The only thing you need to know from each dealer is the out-the-door price.

, Apply for your own financing through a bank, credit union, or other lender before you head to the lot.


One exception to this rule, however, would be if you want to take advantage of a special promotional interest rate offered by the dealership. Compare it to what you can get at your bank or credit union.

, The process of buying a car can take up a lot of energy and a lot of time, so if you want to put up a decent fight, you need to make sure that you can keep up with the salesperson throughout the entire negotiating process.


As a general rule, you should also stop by when you have plenty of time and do not feel rushed. To the same end, you should avoid car shopping when you are in desperate need of a new or new-to-you car.

, Do not go when the dealership is offering a lot of sales and promotions or when there is a lot of customer traffic. Go to a dealership during a weekday when possible, as weeknights and weekends tend to be the busiest. Choose a day with terrible weather toward the end of the month and you'll have a better chance to make a great deal.You might think that the rush of people would work in your favor since it means less time the salesperson can spend on you, but the rush of people also means that more sales are being made, so salespeople are less desperate to sell the cars on the lot and quicker to let you go without making a sale.

, There are two schools of thought concerning the way you lead the salesperson to the car you have in mind. The first states that you should let the salesperson know exactly what you want the moment you step into the dealership. The second states that you should never let the salesperson know that you came in with a particular car in mind.


On the one hand, knowing what you want and the price you want it for lets the salesperson know that you are thoroughly prepared and will not be easy to persuade.
Alternatively, it can also be a good idea not to zero in on any particular car and insist that you love it and need to take it home. Doing so suggests that you are desperate for one specific car, and that is a weak place to start negotiations., The invoice will let you know how much the dealership paid for the car, so you know how low the dealership can afford to go while still making some sort of profit. This gives you a good idea about what your initial offer can be.


Keep in mind, however, the dealer may be getting volume discounts and refunds after the invoice was issued.
The invoice will also tell you important information about the car.
Note that many dealers do not supply this information to customers, referring instead to the ""sticker"" price.

, A salesperson will be trained to ask certain questions like, ""What monthly payment would fit into your budget?"" or ""What are you willing to pay?""


You should answer these questions with your own questions. Explain that you've done a lot of research and have shopped around, but would like to hear from the salesperson first since he is the expert. Conclude by asking for his best price.
The focus should be on the price of the car, not the financing that results in a monthly payment.
As you move through the negotiating process, make small increments that gradually build to your target price. Take your time. Even if the salesperson is in a rush to make the sale, you can make him follow your pace. Determine what your ideal payment would be based on your target price and tell the salesperson that is all you can afford. Don't get into monthly payment until you've agreed on a final price.
The salesperson will go running back and forth to the sales manager for approval. As they come down substantially in price, you inch up your offer very ""painfully.""

, A sticker price (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price or MSRP) might seem like the lowest price you can expect from a dealer, but that really isn't the case. The manufacturer's sticker price is a price calculated by the manufacturer that grants the dealer plenty of profit and wiggle room. In actuality, the dealer can still go below that price and still make money.


Your starting offer should be low. If you worry about offending the salesperson or not being taken seriously, then you might end up making an offer that is too high to start with, and as a result, you could end up paying more than you need to.
Suggest a percentage of the sticker price (88%-90%) as a beginning point if the invoice is not available.

, When looking at options and add-ons, only add options you know you need and actually plan on using. There is no need for you to end up paying for a bunch of extra stuff you don't really want. Include this cost in the total amount you ""can afford to pay.""


Extended warranties and service contracts may sound nice when the salesman pitches them to you, but in actuality, most new cars already have good warranties. Also extended warranties have lots of loopholes, so it may not cover a lot of repairs.
Be on the look-out for extras that cost more than they're really worth, like fabric protection and rust-proofing.
If there are options you do want, make sure to state which options those are in your first offer.

, The downside of figuring out which car you have your heart set on is that, oftentimes, you might find yourself developing an emotional attachment to a specific set of wheels. When it comes to car negotiations, affection is weakness.


You can do a test drive to get a feel for how the car operates, but you should avoid doing anything that could make your attachment to the car stronger, like driving it home or keeping it out for more than a quick spin.

, You need to be firm to avoid being on the losing end of the deal, but at the same time, you should never get nasty with the salesperson. You want to keep as much of your money as possible, and the dealership wants to make as much profit as possible. Neither party is in the wrong, though. It's just how business works.


Also keep in mind that friendly people are more pleasant to deal with, and others may have a natural tendency toward wanting you to stay happy and satisfied if you treat them with the same sort of attitude. You might be tempted to think that being mean or vicious could intimidate the salesperson, or would otherwise encourage her to do whatever necessary to get you to make a deal, but this is not often the case. Usually, being difficult will only make the salesperson feel better about watching you walk out the door empty handed.

, This includes the value of your trade-in and, if applicable, financing. While determining the final price of the car, you should only focus on the actual final purchase price. Talking about anything else may end up prompting the salesperson to take the extra cash they give you for a trade-in and add that amount to the price of the new car.


Do not talk about financing options, monthly payments or any rebates and incentives until that final price has been locked in.
Even if you already have a monthly payment value you can afford, letting the salesperson know this in advance could cause him to stretch financing out for another year instead of dropping the final price of the car.
Mentioning a trade-in early on can complicate things and give the salesperson more opportunity to trick you into accepting what only seems like a good deal due to the deal being offered on your trade-in. This applies when he offers to “pay off the rest of your current car” as well.
If a rebate or other incentive is calculated before you lock in a final price, you have no way of knowing if that rebate is legitimately less or not.

, If the salesperson presents a final offer, and that offer is still above your target price, stand your ground and let the salesperson know that you refuse to go any higher. If she still doesn't budge, politely say farewell.


Note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that the deal is done. Make sure that the salesperson has your phone number and knows your target price before you leave. If this price is at all possible, the salesperson will probably contact you.







, If you have not found a dealer willing to match your target price, you can make a follow-up call to the dealership that came closest to your target price after a couple of weeks pass. Stick to your target price, even when you make a follow-up call. Do not settle.


You should also avoid giving the salesperson the impression that you are desperate or willing to settle for less. Do not let him know that no other dealers have matched your price, either.






When you place a follow-up call, ask to speak to the salesperson or manager you spoke to before. He will already have some relationship with you, so you will not need to start negotiations from the ground up.
Remind the salesperson on the other end of the line that you are only interested if he can meet the figure you proposed. Ask if anything has changed, and if not, politely end the phone call.

, More specifically, place a follow-up call an hour before the dealership closes for the weekend. Oftentimes, a salesperson might be willing to work with you simply for the sake of getting in one final deal before the weekend is over. This is especially true if the salesperson or dealership had a bad week.Call on the last day of the month. The last day of the month is an even better time to make your follow-up call because salespeople might be eager to push out one last deal.






If a salesperson did not meet a quota, for instance, she would be eager to gain one more sale toward that quota on the last day of the month, when those sale amounts are often due to supervisors.
Note, however, that if the month had been very successful for the dealer or the salesperson, this tactic may not work.

, Bad weather tends to drive people away, so a dealership is less likely to make as many sales during periods of heavy rain, wind, or snow. As such, a salesperson might be more desperate to make a sale when the opportunity comes around.


This option works if you have only had a full day of bad weather, but it can be even more effective when you have had several days to a week or more of nasty conditions.

Decide if leasing a car is the right choice for you by examining your driving habits and what you want out of a car. Leasing a car might not be right for you if you want a car for the long term or if you drive an excessive number of miles for work or family obligations.;
,


Determine if you should lease a car by calculating the average number of miles you drive in a year. Factor in your daily commute to work, how much you drive on weekends and whether you tend drive instead of fly on annual vacations. Leases have mileage restrictions so, if this number is high, you may want to purchase a car.

,


Calculate the amount you can afford for a monthly lease payment. Lease payments tend to be lower than car loan payments, so leasing a vehicle could be more economical.

,


Discuss your leasing options with a reputable automobile dealer that leases the kind of vehicle you want. Learn about fees for going over your mileage and whether the lease will include an early payoff option.

,


Use an automobile evaluation resource to determine the market value of the vehicle you want to lease. Kelly Blue Book can help you calculate the market value. Consumer Reports can give you information about market trends. You will be charged a portion of this value, known as the residual value, plus a purchase option fee if you opt to buy your vehicle at the end of your lease.

,


Learn what your purchase options will be at the end of your lease. There could be fees assessed by some dealers but not by others, so be sure to explore the option of buying out your lease as structured by each dealership.

,


The company holding your lease will usually be less likely to negotiate if they know you intend to purchase your leased vehicle. Wait for them to contact you toward the end of your lease. They will offer to extend the option for you to buy out the lease and will be more willing to negotiate the overall price.

In order to find out how much the car is worth, you need to know what car you want. Come up with a limited list of cars that you want to buy. Also come up with a range of years.


Think about your budget, lifestyle, and driving habits.Ask people knowledgeable about cars what a good vehicle for you would be for you.;
, Once you identify the type of car you are interested, look in Kelley’s Blue Book or at Edmunds to find out how much the car is valued at. The price the seller asks for—the “sticker” price—will be higher than what the car is valued at.


Kelley’s lists the “retail value” and the “trade-in value” for cars.The “retail value” is what the car should sell at; the “trade-in value” is how much you should get when trading in your used car.
You can visit Kelley’s website at www.kbb.com. Once there, you can select “Price New/Used Car” and then enter the information on make, model, and year. Kelley’s will tell you the average mileage the car should have and will provide you with a “fair market” price range based on good condition or better.Visit Edmunds at www.edmunds.com. Edmunds will provide a “True Market Value” which consists of the “Trade In” value and the “Dealer Retail” value. You have to enter your zip code as well as the year, make, model, and mileage.

, Next, figure out how much you can pay for the car. Before you can go into negotiations, you need to come up with two numbers: your ideal price and your maximum price. You will negotiate with an eye toward getting your ideal price. You will walk away if you can’t get at least the maximum price.


Your ideal price should be within the “fair market” price range for a car. Unless your negotiating skills are excellent, you should not expect to negotiate the seller down to a price point outside this range.
The reason a car’s “trade in” value is less than its “retail value” is that the seller wants to make a profit. Your goal in negotiation is to lower the amount of profit. It would be very rare that you can convince a seller to sell at a loss. Accordingly, you should not plan on getting a used car for the “trade in” value.

, Before going to a car lot, you might want to get your own financing, either with your bank or credit union.In this way, you can prevent the dealer from giving you a deal on the price but then padding the costs of financing—a common trick used by sellers.


If you have bad credit, however, financing from a dealership may be the way to go. The dealership is more motivated to make a sale than a bank or credit union may be to give you a loan.

, Now that you know what type of car you want, your budget, and the Blue Book price for that model and year, you can begin looking for cars. You can purchase a used car from a dealership or from a private party who advertises on the web or in newspapers.

, Go to Kelley’s and click on “Check My Car’s Value.” Enter the year, make, model, and mileage.You will then have to select the condition the car is in: Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Fair. Ultimately, you will be provided with a “Trade In Range.”


Commit to getting a trade-in price within the range, preferably on the high end.
This only applies if you have a car and a dealer; most individuals will not take a trade.

, You may want to buy a used car from a neighbor or someone who advertises in the newspaper or on Craigslist. In that case, you shouldn’t worry too much about when you purchase the car. But if you want to purchase from a dealership, then try to go near the end of the month.A salesperson may have a monthly quota he or she needs to meet. Also, the dealership may need to clear some cars off the lot to make way for new shipments. If you visit a dealership at the end of the month, you could get a better deal.

, An effective strategy is to have someone go along with you to play “bad cop.” This person should point out negatives about the car, so that the seller doesn’t get too confident that you want to buy it.The bad cop can say things like, “Oh, it’s not four-wheel drive. You wanted four-wheel drive, right?” It doesn’t matter if you don’t want four-wheel drive. The purpose is to sow doubt in the mind of the seller.
The bad cop shouldn’t be too aggressive pointing out flaws. You want the seller to be unsure whether or not you want to buy the car—not convinced that the car isn’t right for you.

, Remember that each party is trying to get the best deal that it can. If you are buying a car from a private party (and not a dealer), then that person may not actually know how much the car is worth. Accordingly, a private seller may get angry at your initial offer.


If the seller doesn’t know the value of the car, then share with him or her your printouts from Kelley’s or Edmunds.Doing so will at least let the seller know that you are not being insulting with your offers.

, If you are purchasing from a dealer, then be sure to negotiate the purchase price of the used car first. Then, you can discuss any trade-in of your current car or financing terms. Sales people will try to lump this all together. By doing this, they can play up how you are getting a good deal on one element (say financing) while masking the fact that you are getting a bad deal in another area (such as price on your trade-in)., A dealer may ask you how much you want to pay for a car. If you give a number, make sure it is the total amount. If you give a monthly payment amount, then the dealer can use financing to stretch out your payment period, from 60 to 72 months, for example.Your monthly payment may be within your range, but the total amount paid could be much higher than you would like.


Ideally, you will not disclose your budget.Instead just shake your shoulders and say, “Depends on the car” or “Don’t know.”

, You should start off with a realistic price. But try to make it 15-25% less than your ideal amount.By contrast, some experts think you should not negotiate at all. Instead, they believe you should tell the seller what your target number is and add that you are only interested in buying if they hit that number.Other experts recommend that you have the seller name the first price. In this way, you will be sure not to go too high in your opening offer.Whatever strategy you employ, remember to stay firm about not going over your maximum price.

, The seller may not immediately respond to your initial offer. It is important not to rush in and fill the silence by increasing the amount you are willing to pay., If the seller won’t agree to your initial offer, don’t immediately accept the counter-offer.Instead, move up in small increments. Also don’t swiftly jump to your ideal or maximum price.For example, if your ideal price is $16,000, then you can start off with an offer of $13,000. If the seller counter-offers with $18,000, don’t immediately jump to $16,000. Instead, move up to $14,000.
When the difference between each party’s price is $1,000 or less, then move in increments of $100., If you and the seller reach an impasse, then politely say that your offer is final and good for 24 hours.The seller may call you if your price was reasonable.Always leave your cell phone number with the seller if you are truly interested in the car., If you are still interested in a car, you can call the seller an hour or so before closing time on the weekend. Try to talk to the same salesperson and check to see if the car is available at the price you want.If the salesperson (or the dealership as a whole) has had a poor weekend, then the seller may be interested in selling to you.

, If the seller still won’t come down on price, one final technique to use is to show up at the dealership with a bank draft made out in the amount you want to pay. A bank draft, also called a “cashier’s check,” is drawn from the bank’s own funds (which the bank gets from you). It is a more secure way for someone to get paid.


Sellers may be tempted to sell. Because you have a draft, the sale would be a “sure” thing, even if the sale is for less than the seller wants. Without another offer on the horizon, the seller may close the sale on the spot.

Take the car for a drive.,
Buy from someone you know.",How to Keep from Getting Ripped off on a Used Car," Always negotiate as a cash customer. Salespeople are masters of financial trickery. You may get a bunch of money for your trade-in, but you'll lose that money on a worse deal for the new car.;
, If you can’t find a mechanic at least have a knowledgeable friend look the car over. Listen to the motor, check the transmission, and check the Air Conditioner. If you are paying a small amount for the car, you can’t expect everything to work.

, Is it even and consistent? Does the oil look okay? Is there water in the oil or some additive? Does the transmission fluid look red or brown? If it is brown smell it to see if it smells like burnt oil. Look under the car. Look to see what has been hidden. Check in the trunk and floor mats.

, Look under the hood along the firewall and inside at the door hinges.

, Let it run for at least 15 minutes to check for overheating. Turn it off and restart it to check the starter. Get out of the car and watch the tailpipe. Does the car emit blue smoke? Look at the oil pressure gauge, does it go up as you rev the engine? Does the alternator or voltage gauge climb when you rev the engine? Do the doors open and close tightly? Is there a puddle of fluid under the car where it was parked? Does the body seem smooth or can you see where someone has put bondo in the holes? Does the car sit straight? If you turn the wheels while the car is running do the turn with little noise? Pull on the wheels, are they tight or do they wobble from side to side. If the car is not too hot? Open the radiator cap while the car runs. Is the water circulating properly? Be careful doing this!

, Go on a road and see if the car tracks straight down the road. Hit the brake s while on a side road and take your hands off the wheel. Be careful on this! Does the car stop straight? Go over some railroad tracks. Does the car bounce all around? Does the car look like it has the same mileage as on the odometer? If it has low miles doe the windshield appear to be sand blasted and old? Is the rubber on the brake and accelerator pads worn? Does the upholstery look worn? If there any evidence that the speedometer has been changed out? As to look at the title and do a CarFax on the car. It is money well spent. Look for oil change stickers. Do these jive with the mileage presently on the car? Just learn to be wise.

, A car dealer is your best bet because he has put up a bond and is required by law to disclose everything he can. If you buy from an individual there is little chance you will have any recourse should you get ripped off. Hopefully this article will save some of you some major headache in the future. This counsel is for free. It cost me a huge fortune learning from my own mistakes.

, It is a fact of life, that cars vary from model to model and manufacturer to manufacturer, so having a particular car in mind, and knowing a little about it will make your job of assessing its condition much easier. Now it is time to look at this specific car.

, If you are dealing with a private seller, this person will have valuable knowledge about the car.


How many miles show on the odometer? It is not uncommon for a modern car to be driven over 200,000 miles (320,000 km), but if you are going to drive long distances commuting or travelling, cars over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) should be seriously depreciated in value, since you may only expect to get a year or two dependable service out of it with this kind of use.
Ask if the car was driven mostly long commutes, or short, in-city driving, since ""highway"" mileage is not as wearing on the drive train, or hard on the brakes and suspension.
Check to see if the previous owners maintained the car properly, changing the oil, oil filter, and air filter at suggested intervals.
Find out if the car was driven in steep, hilly terrain, since this type of use will also cause serious drive train wear.
Find out if the car was driven in areas where salt is commonly used for highway deicing. Since salt is corrosive, you will at least want to pay attention to the undercarriage to see if it is undercoated or shows signs of rust damage.

, You may be able to see signs of abuse, accidents, or other problems by walking around taking a good close look at the paint and finishes.


Look around the lock, if it equipped with a key type lock. If you see a lot of dings, scratches, or scrapes in the paint, you may begin to wonder if the driver has an eye hand coordination problem, or possibly they have been sitting in a bar long enough to have trouble fitting the right key in the keyhole when the bar closes. This doesn't imply you wouldn't buy a car from a drinking person, but it is something to think about.
Look closely at the margins where sheet metal surfaces mate up. For instance, there is a space between the hood edge and the upper front fenders and across the grill. The sheet metal here should have an equal space all the way around, and should be a fairly good fit. Gaps, rubbing surfaces, or other unusual fit may indicate some damage has occurred that may not be immediately apparent.
Look at the lowest part of the body panels, the quarter panels, rails, running boards (if equipped), fairings under the grill, and along the edge of the wheel wells for signs of corrosion or chrome trim becoming loose.
Move a magnet along these same areas if you have any reason to expect plastic body filler has been used to repair sheet-metal damage. Tapping with a plastic pen may also yield clues by the varying sounds it makes, but don't damage the paint by using excessive force or by tapping with a metal object.
Change the angle you are viewing wide metal surfaces so that the light reflection or refraction will expose any differences in paint color, gloss, or dents.
Test the doors and windows to see that they operate smoothly and easily.

, If you can, pull up the edges of the carpet and look for rust or peeling paint.

, The engine may be foreign to you, but there are still some things even an inexperienced person can look for without too much trouble.


Check the oil. Pull the dipstick and look at the oil. It should be between a light amber color and dark brown, and not too thick and sticky looking. Black, tarry looking oil may be a sign of neglect in servicing an engine. Smell the oil, too. If you smell a burnt odor, it might be a sign valve are not seating tightly, allowing hot combustion gases to leak out and ""burn"" the oil. Look for milky or foamy blobs or bubbles in the oil. This could be a sign of a blown head gasket, or cracked block or cylinder head.
Look at the belts, hoses, and rubber tubes and wire insulation. They should be free of cracks, blistering, and unusual color fading or stains. If the main fan belt is a serpentine belt, and the car has significant mileage, the grooved side of the belt may have small cracks perpendicular to the grooves which are a common sign of wear and normally not a problem.
Look for oil, or damp looking stains or dirt on the engine and the rest of the components. Even if you don't see wet engine oil or other fluids, dust will accumulate on even a tiny oil leak, and become damp looking, giving a good indication of a minor leak. The area around the oil filler cap often has some evidence of this type of leak from oil spilled when it is added to the crankcase.
Remove the brake fluid reservoir cap, and see if the reservoir is full. The fluid in this reservoir should be a clear to very light amber color, and should have no foam or bubbles in it. Dark or foamy brake fluid may indicate poor maintenance of the brake system.
On an automatic transmission equipped vehicle, pull the dipstick and look at the transmission fluid. It is usually a pink or red colored very thin oily liquid. If it is dark brown, black, or smells distinctly burned, there is a serious potential for a transmission problem ahead.
Have the car started up with the hood raised, and listen for any knocking, tapping, pinging, or clicking sounds that seem unusual. These noises, especially knocking sounds at the first start-up of the day may indicate wear on the main bearings, and be an indication the engine doesn't have many miles of life left in it. Look for vibration, pulleys which seem to wobble, or fan blades that are not spinning concentrically. Warped or bent components in the alternator, water pump, or air conditioner compressor can lead to repair bills in the near future. Listen for exhaust leaks or smoke coming from the engine vent or the oil filler cap.
Listen when the car is shut off. If it sputters or tries to keep running after the switch is turned off, the car may be due for a major tuneup, which can mean some pretty serious money, depending on the model and the specific work required.

,


Look at the headliner. Is it smooth and intact, with no holes, wrinkles, or tears? Wrinkles in a headliner, particularly, may indicate it has been exposed to moisture, and you may also notice mold or mildew on it.
Burns, tears, or stains in the flooring and upholstery are another sign of lack of care for the car.
Take a deep smell of the interior. If you smell a musty, damp odor, there may be leaks in the floor pan or the windows, doors, or other seams. These are often hard to locate and repair, and long term moisture may cause corrosion problems hidden by carpet or other flooring.
Look at and work the seat belts and seat adjustment features. They should be in good working condition to insure you are comfortable with and in them.
Start the car again, and check the accessories. Try the radio, CD player, or cassette deck, the cigarette lighter plugs, the horn, windshield wipers, interior lights, and other features. Many of these items can be inexpensive and simple to repair, but knowing about problems before you buy makes the decision whether or not to buy easier to make.

, The best place to start this is on a quiet back street or in a relatively empty parking lot. You will want to try some pretty sharp turns and brisk braking, and you won't want to have to deal with traffic while you pay attention to the results of this testing.


Put the car in gear, holding the brakes. Give the car a little gas, and feel for the transmission to push against the brakes. Feel for any vibration, hesitation, or other strange events, and listen for any grunting or grinding.
Let off the brake and give the car a good bit of gas, listening for popping or grinding that may indicate worn or damaged universal joints or suspension components.
Brake the car sharply when you have reached about 10 to 12 mph (16 to 19 km/h), and observe if it stops quickly and smoothly. Any noises or force felt through the steering column may require further investigation to see if steering, suspension, or brake components are worn or damaged.

, You will want to see how it corners, accelerates, and handles in various different conditions. Feel for drift, wobbles, or steering wheel vibrations. While you are doing this, be aware of how the car ""fits"" you. Chances are, you will be spending a lot of time in the driver's seat, so it the leg room, cabin controls, or operating equipment is not configured in such a way to be comfortable to you, you may want to look for a different model or style.

, Get out, and walk around slowly, smelling for any burning lubricants or fluids which may have leaked out on your test drive.

, In cool weather, after a very brief drive, some water may be condensed on the surface of the tail pipe, but it should be clear looking, with no sign of antifreeze or oil in it.

, Using a flashlight, lay down beside the car and look at the transmission, the rear of the engine, beneath the radiator, and for rear wheel drives, the back differential, to see if there are any signs of leaks. It doesn't hurt to park the car in a different place than it was in before the test drive to look in the driveway for any stains caused by fluids leaking out previously.

, You have to remember, you are buying a used car, and there will undoubtedly be some wear and tear to the vehicle when you buy it.

The cars usually get crushed or cannibalized for parts, but sometimes, junkyards have a few cars that have yet to be destroyed.


Contact nearby junkyards to find out if they sell their ""junkers"" to the public and, if so, ask to come in and have a look. The junkyard will either show you the cars they have available or allow you to look for yourself. After you find a car that interests you, negotiate for a price. The price will usually be quite low.
Be prepared to put a lot of work into the car once you purchase it. Cars purchased from junkyards are usually in poor condition and in need of some work.;
, You have likely seen, at some point in your life, cars with “For Sale” signs in the window. When you do not need a car, you may not realize how many of these cars there actually are. Watch out for cars driving down the road or sitting in parking lots and driveways that are being advertised for sale. Jot down the number you see on the sign. When you call, ask how much the car is going for and what the car’s history is.


Be aware of the fact that buying a car from an individual seller does present a risk. It is harder to verify whether or not an individual is being honest about the car’s history, and it is also harder to hold the seller responsible if the car turns out to be a lemon when you bring it home.

, Let your relatives, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and neighbors know that you are looking to buy a cheap used car. Ask them to keep their eyes open for cars with “For Sale” signs in the window. A close relative might go so far as to call the number and find out the necessary information for you, but even a casual acquaintance or co-worker whom you get along with will probably be willing to jot down a phone number if he or she sees it.

, This is, perhaps, the most obvious option. A used car lot will offer you a good amount of selection and a decently low price. Even though used car dealers have a notorious reputation for cheating their customers, you can find out if a particular dealer is trustworthy or not by looking the company up on the Better Business Bureau or on local review websites. Regardless of the dealer’s reputation, you should also protect yourself by checking the vehicle history report of any car on a dealer’s lot before you buy it., Your local newspaper will be able to put you in touch with local individuals who have a used car to sell. Check out the classifieds section to look at the cars for sale, paying attention to price, make, and description. Due to character counts, the descriptions might be fairly scant, so you should be prepared to ask for more details when you contact the seller.


If you do not receive the newspaper on your doorstep, go to a gas station or drugstore and buy a copy there. If you do not want to buy the paper, ask a neighbor or someone you know to save the classifieds for you.

, These websites are very similar to newspaper classifieds with the exception that there are no character counts limiting the ads. That means that you should look for an ad that divulges more information rather than less information. Typically speaking, the more informative an ad is, the less the seller feels he needs to hide.


Gravitate toward ads that also have photographs. As they say, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” You cannot know everything there is to know about a car simply from a picture, but you can learn a lot.

, You can search for a specific make or model when browsing for used cars on an online auction website, or you can just search for used cars by category. You can also specify a minimum and maximum price you are willing to pay. Unless you are also able to specify where the product is being sold from, though, you run the risk of finding a car on the other side of the nation, which may make it unreasonably difficult to get the car shipped to you.

, A quick Internet search for “used cars” or “buy used cars,” performed using your favorite search engine, will turn up numerous websites that specialize in the trade of used cars. Many of these websites allow sellers to post ads while retaining ownership of the car, but a handful of these websites sell cars that they first purchased used from other sellers.


Before buying from either type, find out what policies the website has in place to protect the buyer and also look for third-party reviews about the trustworthiness of the website.
Search using a website that provides vehicle history reports. Aside from being able to look up a specific car on the website, you can usually look up local dealerships and used cars for sale, as well. By searching through a vehicle history report website, you can access the car listing and its history report in a single step instead of two.

Figure out how much you're willing to spend given your current income and expenses.If you intend to take out a loan, or make payments on the car over time, figure out reasonable month-to-month payments. Look into your current income as well as your current expenses. How much money could you afford to putting towards payments on a used car or on a loan? How much would a car cost, total, with these loan payments in mind?
Weigh in other costs as well. In addition to payments on the car itself, you'll have to think about cost of registration, taxes, title, and insurance. This will tack on about $1,500 to $3,000 to the total costs. You may also want to invest in a warranty plan through the dealer, which will add some costs as well.
You'll also have regular costs associated with the car, like repairs, gas, parking, oil changes, and maintenance.;
, Once you've weighed in what you can reasonably afford, create a target price for yourself. It can help to consult online price guides. Such guides will give you a range of prices for used cars, helping you determine what a reasonable price range is for your needs. Online guides typically include the manufacturer's price for a variety of types of cars, as well as the typical selling price for the car.When looking for cars, avoid cars that are on the high end of your chosen price range. During negotiation, you may end up paying slightly higher., You can fund the purchase of a used car by selling your old car. Figure out about how much you can get for your current car before you begin looking for a new one.Not having a car to trade in will not affect your ability to get a good deal on a used car. In fact, many experts recommend that you treat the sale of your current car and purchase of a new one as separate transactions. This will help you get the most for your money.


There are many online outlets that allow you to gauge your car's value, such as Kelly's Blue Book or NADA Guides. You'll have to enter a variety of information into such sites, such as your car's year, make, and current condition. Be honest about your car's condition. The more honest you are, the more accurate of an estimate you'll receive.
Keep in mind you may make more money selling your car privately, especially if it's in good conditions. However, this can take a lot of time. If you're looking to sell fast, it's a good idea to shop your car around to several dealerships in the area and take the best offer.
You should also look online at car listings sites like Cars.com or eBay Motors to get a sense of what kind of offer to hope for. Make sure to look for your car's specific model, year, and features to get the closest approximation of what a good offer would be.

, Once you have a sense of what kind of budget is reasonable for you, figure out the type of car you want. This will help you find the right seller, and get a better sense of what you can expect to pay. Consider things like size, mileage, and safety when thinking about the car you want.You can use websites like Kelly's Blue Book to look at a variety of types of cars. In addition to the car's build, pay attention to things like the year. Cars from a certain year may have special features that better suit your needs.
You should also pay attention to marks of quality regarding your chosen car type. Assess whether or not the vehicle is in good shape by getting a vehicle history report (as described in the part of the article titled ""researching the car""). This information will be helpful to you during the buying process, as you'll be able to better tell if you're getting a good deal on a car.
Getting a vehicle history report is a crucial step in determining whether or not the car you want is in good condition. However, before doing that you should also give the car a visual inspection for damage or obvious signs of poor maintenance.
For example, look for chipped or stained paint, cracked or over-worn tires, body damage, corroded battery leads, damage to the engine, strong odors, signs of water damage, rust, and proper engine fluid levels. Any of these can be signs of previous accidents or poor maintenance. You should also run the climate control systems in the car and give it a test drive.
If you find any major flaws with the car like signs of water damage or oil leaks, move on to another vehicle.

, Once you have a sense of what you want, begin looking for an outlet. Look for a dealer that offers the type of car you want, at prices affordable for you.You can use an online search tool, where you can narrow down your search by entering information like type of car and your price range. You can also browse the local yellow pages. You can visit a few dealerships, checking the typical prices for their cars.
Read reviews before settling on a dealership. You want to make sure any company you work with has a good reputation. Websites like Yelp will provide a variety of reviews. Remember, one or two bad reviews among many solid reviews may be a fluke. However, an onslaught of negative reviews is probably a bad sign.

, In addition to dealers, you can also purchase used cars from individuals. This method comes with a bit more risk, but is also where you can get a really great deal. Browse car listings websites, the newspaper, and look around town for used cars for sale. If you can find a car owner looking to make a quick sale, you can usually talk them down further than you could a dealer.


When purchasing from an individual, you have to be cautious. Make sure to ask for a vehicle history report that includes its accident history and maintenance. You should also take the vehicle for a test drive before buying.
When paying for the new car, your best option is to use cash. This will be the most secure method for both you and the seller.

, The vehicle identification number (VIN) is a small number usually found on the lower lefthand side of a car's front wind shield. Before purchasing a used car, you want to make sure you examine the VIN. If it looks like it has been tampered with, the car may have been stolen. Checking the VIN is a good way to weed out scams., Once you've settled on a dealership and obtained the VIN for the vehicle, make sure you assess a car's condition. You should obtain a history report for the car to make sure it was in good condition prior to purchase.Ask the dealer for the car's vehicle identification number (VIN). For a small fee, you can run a car's VIN through a website, such as vehiclehistory.com or CARFAX, for a report on a car's history. You do not want to purchase a car that has had multiple maintenance issues in the past.
You should also request the dealer provide you with a vehicle history report. A solid dealer will not hesitate to provide the report. Look the report over for any major red flags. You do not want to buy a car with a history of breaking down, or one that's gone through multiple owners.

, You should always take a driving test before purchasing a used car. You want to make sure the car drives smoothly and that you like the feel of the vehicle. You do not want to purchase a car you are uncomfortable driving.Make sure you take a long driving test. A few minutes is not long enough to assess whether a car is a good fit for you.
Pay attention to seat comfort. Do you feel comfortable in this car? Does the seat work for you? Also, think about how the car drives. Do you feel comfortable handling the steering wheel? Remember, you'll be driving this car for awhile. You want to make sure you're comfortable in it.
You should also check to make sure the car works. Check things like the CD jack, the interior lights, the stereo, and other aspects of the car's interior.

, If you're interested in the car after driving it, you should have it inspected. You can take the car to your regular mechanic and have him or her look it over to make sure it's in good condition. Unfortunately, not every dealership will allow a pre-purchase inspection. However, if you're insistent on wanting the inspection conducted, a dealer may allow it if he or she believes it'll increase the chances of a sale., If everything checks out, you'll want to make an offer on the car. Before doing so, do so more research. Once again, use sites like Kelly's Blue Book and AutoTempest to figure out the average market price for the car you're considering. You can use these pricing guides during negotiation. You'll be able to tell when the dealer is requesting an unreasonably high price for the car., When you begin the negotiating process, have the seller start. If the salesperson names the first price, you can work down from there. The opening price is what will define the negotiation, and you do not want to give the seller the chance to push your price range up.Start off the negotiation by asking, ""What are you selling the car for?""
Once the seller names the price, you'll be able to bargain down. Usually, the first price named will be a couple of thousand dollars below the advertised price.

, You want to make sure, during negotiations, that the salesperson knows you've done your homework. A salesperson will be more willing to negotiate if he knows that you're aware of the average costs of the car you're considering buying. Mention you've looked at a website like Edmund's or Kelly's Blue Book, and mention the prices listed on those sites. You're unlikely to get a price in the exact range you want, but the salesperson will be willing to go lower if they know they're working with an informed customer., Do not be hesitant to keep negotiating. A salesperson's money is often made on commission. It's in the salesperson's best interest to eventually make a sale. Keep pushing to go lower until you get a price in your range.You usually negotiate in a cubicle. Take opportunities to occasionally leave the cubicle during the negotiation process. This conveys to the salesperson that you will not be controlled, and that you're independent enough to take breaks and walk out of negotiations.
Do not be afraid to let the negotiation go overnight. If you're not getting the price you want, say you'll come back tomorrow to discuss. After some time has passed, the salesperson may be willing to go lower. Salespeople want to sell as many cars as possible, so it's in their interest not to have a potential buyer walk away.

, Once you've reached a price you're comfortable with, you can close the deal and walk away with your car. You'll usually pay with cash or check, and should make sure you get the car insured before driving away. Review all documents thoroughly before signing to assure you're getting the deal you want and that there are no hidden costs.It may be a good idea to take a day to review the documents. If you're unfamiliar reading legal papers, see if you can get a lawyer to review the documents for a small fee.

Bring the car for a test drive.",How to Check a Used Car's Engine," Before you so much as peek in the window, get down on one knee and check the ground for underneath the car for spots, drips or puddles. If they are there, try to figure out their age - are they old oil streaks or fresh spots? Perhaps there's even a puddle that has an active drip filling it from above?


Take a look, and decide whether this car just accidentally parked over an old spill, or if it is losing precious fluids right before your eyes. Although this is not always a deal breaker, any kind of drip, ooze, leak or seep can be indicative of much larger problems.






Dealers and owners will tell you that a little oil seepage is normal and this is partly true - some makes and models are notorious for leaking oil, but that doesn't mean that the car is in trouble. It's just up to you whether you think it's worth it to occasionally have to add oil.





;
, Puddles can also be made from brake lines, cooling systems, transmissions, power steering or even washer fluid. If you find a wet spot, you might want to poke it with your finger.


Reddish fluid is probably transmission fluid. Black fluid is generally just old oil. Caramel is the color of fresh oil, or old power steering or brake fluid. Green or orange fluid is probably coolant.
Be mindful of clear puddles, which might be just water, meaning it rained, the engine was washed or the A/C has been running recently. Once you have some on your finger tip you should be able to tell if it is oil or water-based. If it seems like both, look out, and pay more attention in the following steps.

, Sellers will often take a hose to a car they want to sell, and some will even try to clean up the engine compartment, but just as a rule, the underbelly of the car will be overlooked. Puddles or no, look to see how clean things are. You can probably ignore plain old dirt, and even expect to see a certain amount of road grime and greasy spots (It's a car, after all) but you'll want to watch out for drips or beads of fluids that have formed but not yet dropped.


Keep an eye out for wet spots, dark spots, and clumps of filthy oily sludge, paying close attention to the oil pan, and any seams or gaskets you can spot. It is not uncommon for there to be a little grime leftover from past issues that have since been fixed.
However, fresh, wet grime or oil can mean problems, so take note of what you see. Don't hesitate to poke at things (maybe use a paper towel) to see how drippy, wet, slimy, or caked on they might be.

, If you do see drips or runs of wet sludge, try to sort out where they are coming from. Leakiness might be enough to get you to move on to the next car in the lot, but it will be up to you to decide if leaks alone are enough of a problem to prevent you from buying the car.


Some folks will happily add oil to make up for a drippy oil pan, and can go for years without any serious repercussions beyond the expense and inconvenience of it. Some leaks are minor, and can take months to add up to significant losses, while some get progressively worse and can lead to real problems.
If nothing is obviously leaking, dripping, or caked over with sludge, you can start feeling confident. A great number of potential engine problems can be ruled-out just by there being no visible loss of fluids.

, Before you ever even start the engine, have your seller pop the hood for you, just so you can have a look at the engine and take note of any smells.


A pristine, shiny new engine should smell of rubber and plastic with a hint of gas or oil. In the best of all possible conditions, you will smell fumes that naturally come off belts, hoses, and the various plastic parts. This is called outgassing, and is completely normal. The smell of an engine compartment should not be too different from the smell of new tires.
In a used car, you will almost certainly smell oil. This is normal, and so long as it isn't overwhelming, it's not something you need to be afraid of. You may also smell gas. A whiff of it is perfectly normal, and in older cars with carburetors, even a good solid waft of gas-imbued fumes is not an uncommon thing. However, if you are smelling a lot, that might mean a leak in the fuel system and could be a cause for concern.
You may also smell turpentine, which is essentially the smell of bad, old gas. That smell might mean the car has just been sitting for a while. You should be able to ask your seller if there is fresh gas in the tank, and how long the car has been sitting for. This is not usually a huge deal, but stagnant gas can cause problems, up to and including rust in the gas tank.
Another possibility is the sickly sweet smell of antifreeze. This could just be from spills, but you'll still need to check for leaks in the cooling system. On a cold motor, these can be spotted by a white-to greenish film; a sign that coolant has evaporated. An acrid, tart smell may also be present, which will indicate a need to take a closer look at the battery at some point.

, Take a look at the engine. Do you see paint? Bare metal? Gunk? Dirt? Keep in mind that it may be preferable to see dirt or even cobwebs. Dealers and sellers will often clean up an engine compartment both to be courteous, and to make it look nice This does make the engine look better, but it can remove evidence of leaks, and even steer your eye away from obvious flaws.


A dirt covered engine, on the other hand, will show you where every drop of oil or gas has been, will show you which parts have been tinkered with or replaced (clean spots), and also indicates that the car has been driven, which means it has at least recently been working. Cobwebs tell you that it's been sitting a while, which may mean nothing, or may mean extra steps later on.
A sludge-caked, grimy engine is a good and a bad thing. It an indicate a leak, but at least you can locate the source of the leak by following the path of the sludge. If it's just a heap of sludge and blackened goo, it may be time for new gaskets, or even a rebuild.
However, this does not mean that the engine itself has gone bad, nor even that you won't be able to drive it for years before having real problems. A fuel leak will often actually create a clean spot on an otherwise dirty engine, but usually fuel leaks are fairly subtle, and you'll need to use your nose to know if they actually exist.

, By now you will have stumbled across your oil dipstick. Pull it, clean it off, put it back, pull it again. Is there oil? Good. At this point, the oil can even be low, so long as there is some in there. Most cars will not show correct oil levels unless they are warm.


If you have an automatic transmission, there is another dipstick in there, so you should check this too, using the same remove/clean/replace/remove method. Again, you just want to be sure that there is some transmission fluid in there.






If you have power steering, there will be a pump in there somewhere. Usually this pump just has a lid with a small dipstick. Check to make sure that there is at least some fluid in there. Also check your brake fluids, while you are at it. Usually your brake fluid reservoir is translucent, and you can see without opening anything where the level is.






Finally, you should also check the coolant levels and the washer fluid levels. Take note of anything with low levels, and remember if you end up buying this vehicle to top everything off to its appropriate levels.







, Ask your seller when the car's belts and hoses were last replaced. Cracks in the rubber most likely means that these parts will need to be replaced soon. A clever clean-up, and even old ratty belts and hoses can look fine on the surface, so don't be shy about reaching around in the engine compartment, squeezing hoses and plucking at belts.


If the belts are a little shoddy, just keep in mind that these will need to be replaced. Most dealers will have made an assessment of such problems, but you aren't necessarily working with a dealer, and these things sometimes get overlooked.
Mainly, you just need to make sure that there are belts in there. Some cars won't start without them, but some have second belts that charge things or let your A/C and power steering work, so do be sure that every pulley you see has either a belt attached or a good reason not to have one.
Check for soft, mushy cooling hoses, which is a clearer sign of age than their outward appearance. Check the areas where the hoses attach to things, and look for the telltale film of hot leaks. These leaky spots sometimes only develop when engines are hot, so there won't be any dripping, and a good dose of engine cleaner can make them vanish, so you do need to really look to see if there is even a trace of residue, not unlike the hard water scaling you sometimes have to clean from your teakettle.

, It's not uncommon at all for used cars to drain their batteries as they sit, so don't be discouraged if the car needs a jump start at some point.

For now, take a look at the battery itself to be sure it isn't cracked or leaking. Look for exposed cable, which is not terrible as long as it has not turned green, or become caked in white residue.






Look for white (or green, or green/white) residue caked on the terminals as well. Usually this is just a sign of an aging battery that has been sitting a while, and can be cleaned up with a toothbrush and some soda water, and a toothbrush.
Again, the best possibility is a layer of regular old dusty dirt, on otherwise clean metal and plastic. This doesn't mean it's a good battery or that the terminals aren't corroded in a way you can't see, but it does mean that no such potential problems have been hidden by an auto detailer's hard work.







, If you are buying a car from a dealer, the air filter should be clean and new. If you're buying from a person, it could be old and dirty and need replacing.


If the air filter needs replacing, it is likely that more (if not all) of the filters (such as the oil, gas, cabin air, transmission filters) are due to be replaced as well.
Ask your seller if you aren't sure or if you don't want to dig into the air filter to see for yourself.

, If the car has a turbo charger, that's likely something you won't be able to diagnose until the car is running. However, at the very least you can check for leaks and make sure it is connected and not rusted through.

, Step back and take a wide view of the engine compartment and its various goings-on. Every make and model has a different setup - there might be a lot going on, or it might be a fairly common and simple situation.


Look for loose wires and hoses. Look for little things that you might not understand, but look off to you, like uncovered holes or potential missing parts.
Newer cars are harder to sort out, what with electronics (look for scorches, burns, obvious damage) and complicated vacuum systems.
Older cars are simpler, and are more forgiving of after-market tampering. Discuss any changes or modifications your seller has made.

, Stop and take a closer look at the underside of your used car's hood. There are clues there, if not always clear indicators. What you want to see is a clean, (again, regular dirt is not a problem) and intact liner, which is there to muffle engine noise and also to act as a fire retardant.


A sludgy, leaky, oil-burning car might have blackened the liner. If the underside of your hood is just darkened, it's likely not a problem, but if any part of it is scorched, burned, or has been torn away or removed, that's a sign of a past engine fire.






If you find evidence of fire, ask when and how it happened, and you may find that the engine has been rebuilt, in which case you just want to be concerned about any current leaks of fuel or oil.
A past engine fire should at the very least make you wary, but even such a sordid history does not by itself mean the car is simply no good.

, Exhaust leaks are one of the things that can cause engine fires. You might not have a good view of the exhaust manifold in the engine compartment, but it's easy enough to check the tailpipe. The exhaust tip should be ashy grey on the inside.


If it is black on the inside, this means that the car has been running rich (too much gas in the air/fuel mix), which is bad but not terrible, and usually just means poor fuel economy. White tips mean the car is running lean (too much air in the air/fuel mix), which makes for increased wear and tear, and a hot running engine.






In older cars this is a problem of timing and valve adjustment. In newer cars it indicates something wrong in the electronics; usually an O2 sensor, or perhaps an airflow sensor, sending inaccurate information to the computer, which then makes errors in regulating the mix. Either way, problems with the exhaust pipe will require a tune up.







, So you've looked and sniffed and poked and grabbed, and nothing has scared you away thus far, so nothing to do but fire the car up and see if it goes. Three things could happen.


It starts and runs, first try.
It takes a minute to get it going.
It doesn't start.

, You turned the key and nothing happened? Not so much as a dash light? Check the battery, and connections. Pay particular attention to the terminals, and make sure the cables are connected good and tight, and not corroded. Again, a little soda will help get these clean enough to keep a good contact.


Dash lights come on, you turn the key and then you hear a click, followed by nothing? Still probably just a dead battery, or even just a bad connection. Check it and charge it. Pull it out if you have to, or use jumper cables. The best practice is to remove the battery, connect an AC powered charger, and give it some time.






The engine turns over, but does not start? Give the gas pedal a good stomp, wait a few seconds, and try again. Pump the gas pedal as you turn it over. If this doesn't work, continue to try a couple more times. If the car has been sitting, it may just take some time for good fuel to be pumped from the tank to the engine. With any luck it will catch at some point and you'll likely not have to do that again.







, If nothing is happening still, make sure the spark plug wires are snug. If you find a loose one, get it snug, and try again to start the car.


Still nothing? You will probably have to pull the spark plugs and clean them. If the car has a carburetor, you can also try dumping a few teaspoons of gas straight into the venturi (the part where the air goes in).
This whole process sometimes has to be repeated, just to get the engine going after a car has been parked for a substantial amount of time. On that note, if you have a car sitting around and want to sell it, start it up once in a while so this doesn't happen.

, Once you get the car running, get out and let the car idle while you look around the engine compartment again, and look for things smoking or leaking. Listen for wheezing, clicking, knocking or thumping sounds. Sniff for gas fumes (there will be a little) or burning (there might be some). Here are something you may hear, and suggestions as to what they might mean:


""TicTicTicTicTic"" noise, increasing in speed as you rev the engine. Sticky lifters, flat cams, loose valves, and even a loose belt can do this. If it goes away after you add oil, or after the car gets good and warm, that's a lifter. Although it's nothing to panic about, it's something you'll want to address at some point in the future.
A ""NokNokNokNok"" noise that increases in frequency when the engine is revved is called an engine knock. This can be bad news and might be a sign that you should walk away from this particular car (unless it's a diesel, in which case this is exactly how it's supposed to sound).
Squealing, shrieking, squawking? This is usually the belt, or belts, and sometimes the pulleys that they turn on. Plan to change the belt. If the noise continues after changing the belt, you'll need to figure out which pulley. Alternators and air conditioner pumps can make these noises too, and can also just make scraping noises. Be mindful of such sounds, but unless they really start to bother you, don't worry too much
A louder knock which does not match RPMs but may be present while accelerating or at low idle might indicate an engine or transmission mount that needs to be replaced. Not an emergency, but you'll want to get that fixed too, at some point.

, Everything seem good? Close the hood, and if you are taking a test drive, take it straight to your local auto parts store and have them connect and check codes for other little things you might not have noticed. This only applies to cars from the 80's and later, and usually only helpful if there is a check engine light on after you start.


Your parts guy or your mechanic can help you out from there. You've done pretty much everything you need to do to be sure your engine is at least sound enough to get you to the store. As you drive take note of any issues such as a distinct lack of power, any odd shuddering, or any other sort of odd behavior.
The code reader can give you some details to get you started on the process of replacing parts and electronics and getting things tuned in. Your local auto parts counterman has a device that can check your car's computer codes, and most will do it for free if they have the time. If someone tries to charge you for a checkup, drive on down to the next place.
You might need a tune up, or even a rebuild. If you made it this far, though, you have a working engine. Congratulations. Your fluid levels filled, your battery charged, good gas in the tank, and you're driving. See how it feels - in the end that's what's important.

Settle on a year, make and model of a used car you would like to purchase.,
Look up the car's worth in Kelly Blue Book to determine the value of the car you would like to purchase.,
Choose between purchasing a car at a private seller or dealership.,
Visit the seller to look at a used car.,
Ask the seller if you can have the vehicle inspected by an independent mechanic.,
Negotiate a price with the seller and purchase the used car.,
Sign a contract, also known as a bill of sale, for the used car that you are purchasing.,
Get a receipt.,
Receive the title from the seller of the vehicle.",How to Buy a Used Car With Cash," Before you make your final decision, check out a website such as Consumer Reports so that you can read some reviews on the car.


You may also want to look up the vehicle with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine if the car that you are interested in purchasing has been recalled.;
, Kelly Blue Book will give you both a private seller and dealership value.

, While you may save money with a private seller, many used cars sold by dealerships are certified and come with a warranty.

, Do not tell the seller how much you would like to spend on a vehicle. Simply ask to take the car for a test drive and perform a visual inspection of its interior and exterior.

, If the seller says no, it is likely that there is a hidden problem with the car. Look at other used cars if your independent mechanic finds a problem with the vehicle.

, Ask the seller to give you the best price that the used car can be sold for. If that price is over the Kelly Blue Book value you found, let the seller know that you won't be paying a dime over that value.


Private sellers expect cash, so they generally won't sell below the Kelly Blue Book value. You have some wiggle room with dealerships because they prefer cash and can afford to go below Kelly Blue Book value since they do a higher volume of sales.

, The bill of sale must also include the date of sale, the make, model, year, and VIN of the vehicle, the current odometer reading, and the sale price. If a warranty is included with the used car, that must be mentioned, as well.

, A receipt will show that you paid for the used car in cash and must have the signature of the seller from whom you purchased the vehicle. The receipt must also include the invoice number from the bill of sale or the VIN of the vehicle.

, Both you and the seller are required to sign it. Check with the Department of Motor Vehicle in your state to determine if the title needs to be notarized.

Major vehicle components.",How to Buy a Used Car," You should always try to get what you want, but have a backup plan. There are many sources such as Consumer Reports Car Buying Guide, car complaints.com, J.D. Power, US News and World Report, and a host of others. Try using a variety of sources when researching a particular vehicle or vehicles. Remember that highly rated cars command premium prices. A lower rated car can be a gold mine if you can put up with a design flaw or two.


Consider a car with fewer options or an alternate make and model. For instance, Lincoln is a luxury version of Mercury. The Lincoln model will have more features and luxury items included. Various models may have deluxe trim packages such as leather seats, enhanced stereo systems, etc. If you are trying to save money, stay away from features that promote a higher price tag.

, Study consumer reviews, compare Kelley Blue Book values, Edmunds Book values, NADA Guides, etc. Research resale values and conduct vehicle history reports with VIN numbers (you can use vindecoder.com to determine if the car you are looking at is in fact the car you are looking at). Keep in mind, most sites like carfax.com are not free sites. Most good legitimate sellers will have a Carfax or some other form of report listed with the car. If they don't, or they refuse to furnish a copy of a vehicle history report, stay away! If there are any particular issues or recalls with the model you're looking at, you may avoid serious issues by doing your research ahead of time (carcomplaints.com is an excellent unbiased source of information).

, Don't dwell on price just yet; consider how long you will keep the car, what an affordable payment is for your budget, and how much you can put down. Consider a brand new car instead of a used car, if it has subvention financing (a manufacturer's reduced financing rate).

Stay away from dealer financing! The most lucrative department at any car dealership is the finance division! The way they make their money is like this: your credit score is run. The credit score determines what kind of APR they can give you. That APR is ""adjusted"" so that the dealership makes their money off the spread. They can do this because they do not have to tell you what you are pre-approved for!

, The absence of monthly payments can have a wonderful effect on your finances.

, When you attempt to buy a used car, you need to consider what (if any) down payment you can make, how much you can afford for monthly payments, and how much insurance premiums are going to cost you on your used car purchase. If your insurance is likely to double, you need to budget this in so you're not extending yourself by agreeing to a monthly payment that is too high. Take into account fuel economy and maintenance costs. These expenses can vary greatly depending on the vehicle.

, Banks are typically willing to offer financing on a used car. However, some banks refuse to finance a used car that is six years old or older. If your bank will work with you on financing, this may be the wisest decision. Banks or credit unions typically offer lower interest rates than dealerships. But, don't rule out the dealership just because your bank is willing to finance your used car purchase. By letting the dealership know the interest rate you have negotiated with the bank, you may get a lower offer from the dealership.

, CarGurus, Autotrader, cars.com, Craigslist and Kijiji (Canada) are excellent places to find used vehicles.

, Get as much history as possible of the vehicle. Try to get the previous owners name and call them. Run your own CarFax and Autocheck reports; dealers have been known to ""lose"" the last sheet. Make sure to obtain the vehicle identification number (""VIN"") off of the car you are inclined to check out with CarFax, Autocheck, or any other third-party car history company; the VIN is usually found on the lower level end of the windshield, right above the dashboard on the driver's side. Watch for flood damage, frame damage, unknown mileage or salvage history, and excessive wear and tear.

, Always. Try the car on different roads, and drive for at least 15 minutes. Remember you will be driving this car for a while.

Drive it to listen for engine noise, test acceleration levels and check the brakes. Listen for rattles or squeaks.






Notice if the suspension seems even and provides an easy, comfortable ride. Look at the tires.






Take a look at the engine underneath the hood. If it looks like it hasn't been taken care of or lots of extraneous wiring exists, ask for detailed service records.






See if it pulls to one side or the other. It's an alignment issue (or bad tires) if it pulls all the time; it's a brake problem if it pulls when stopping. #*Check for brake shudder when stopping; (that's front rotors and probably pads). It should not wander; (tires or steering components).






If you have time, sit in the car for an hour... seats often feel comfortable until you've sat in them a while.







, Get the car checked professionally. If the dealer won't let you have it checked by your own mechanic, run, don't walk from that store. Pay the mechanic to check it. He should put it up in the air and check for frame/under-body damage.

, The most frequently used sources for this are, DriverSide, Edmunds, Latest Cars and Kelly Blue Book Is the seller's price very similar, or is there an unexplained difference in price?

, Always know what you want to pay for the vehicle before you start. Using resources like NADA guides will allow you to figure out EXACTLY what you should pay. You can try to outsmart the seller/dealer, but remember, he/she does this every day for a living! Try to compromise at the point that is good for you. Remember a ""win win"" situation is always required for a sale to occur. Never negotiate if you are not ready to walk away. You might lose the upper hand over the dealer if you buckle.

, V5, MOT, and service history. Insist on 2 sets of keys minimum.

, You don't want to end up with a car that has been flooded. Since Hurricane Katrina, many used cars have been brought on the lot with just that problem. Ordering a CARFAX Vehicle History Report is worth your time and money and empowers consumers in knowing exactly what they are purchasing. Autocheck, a similar product, reports far more accidents than CARFAX due to the data collection methods used. It is wise to use both.

, To make sure a car is not stolen, police agencies have records of stolen vehicles reported to them. Consult with the police if you are not satisfied with the amount of detail you are getting from the vehicle history....it can save you time and worry down the line.

, Not every person has the technical knowledge of a mechanic. However, there is absolutely no reason the average consumer can't learn enough about cars to be able to perform an initial inspection on the approximate condition of the car. It is highly recommended to have the car you are seriously considering inspected by a mechanic: it would be costly and impractical to have every car you like inspected. Some used cars are in poor condition and can be overpriced since people tend to place emotional and sentimental value on them. By learning how to inspect the basic mechanical components of a used car you can drastically reduce the amount of time and money you spend pursuing ""lemon"" vehicles.

, As part of any used car inspection you must be able to accurately inspect the engine, transmission, drivetrain, brakes & tires, electrical system, exhaust & emissions, glass & mirrors as well as being able to spot potential problems with the car.

Set aside a definite budget.,
Consider your transportation needs.,
Shortlist cars.,
Analyze the information in the ad.,
Contact the seller at a reasonable hour.,
During this phone call verify the make, model, year, mileage, vehicle identification number and general condition of the vehicle.,
Schedule an appointment to see the actual car and take it for a spin.,
Ask for a maintenance history for the vehicle.,
Use the VIN to do a detailed car history search.,
Make a thorough inspection of the vehicle, with the engine off and on.,
Inspect the vehicle for any signs of water damage.,
Inspect the car for any rust or body damage.,
Examine the mileage on the vehicle.,
Check the tires, especially the front, for wear.,
Examine the battery.,
Check the air filter.,
Examine the engine’s coolant and oil levels while the car is off.,
Check the transmission fluid with the engine running.,
Check the climate control in the car.,
Test drive the car.,
Make sure the seller has all the necessary paperwork.,
Have a professional mechanic inspect the car and perform any necessary tests at your expense as mechanics tend to favor the person paying for the inspection.,
Make an offer if the car suits you.,
Get the signed title from the seller.",How to Buy a Used Car from a Private Party," Private sellers expect to be paid by cash or check, in-full and upfront, and cannot provide financing. However, private sellers tend to be quite a bit cheaper than dealerships, making an all-at-once payment more beneficial. Note, however, that consumer protection laws do not apply to private sellers.Check the Kelley Blue Book value of any car you are considering.


Apply for financing through a bank if you cannot pay the total cost of the car upfront. If you do not have enough saved you should consider a personal loan from a bank. The total cost of this can vary considerably depending on your credit score. Apply for this financing before you approach a seller.
Look up the laws in your state regarding private sales. In nearly every state, caveat emptor ('Buyer Beware"") applies. Basically, this means that once the money changes hands, you have no legal recourse or warranty if things go bad, even the day after you buy the car. You'd have to get any warranty in writing, preferably on the bill of sale.;
, Consider whether you will haul large loads, transport groups of people, the distance you will regularly travel, as well as the terrain. Plan for everyday use, and not edge-cases to avoid searching for cars that exceed your needs. This will help you filter what kind of vehicle you are looking for.

, Look through auto classifieds, online, in your local paper, and through friends and family. Online sources like Craigslist can allow you to quickly sort through and filter sellers. Sellers are competing in a saturated market, so be discriminating in which ads you choose to make a response.

, Ads that are not descriptive or detailed often indicate that the seller is being disingenuous. The more information you are able to readily verify in the ad, the better. You will also be able to compare any asking price against a market price. Once you know the car's basics, look up similar models to compare prices.


Note that terms like ""clean,"" and ""runs great"" are not legally enforceable terms, nor particularly helpful for a buyer. Focus on miles, any recent mechanical work needed, make, model, and year of the car.

, Try not to call too late in the evening or too early in the morning - the seller may not be able to talk for long and tell you about the car. The seller should be easy to reach through the contact information in the ad, if not avoid further contact, as this might be a scam.


If you want to negotiate the price of the car, know what price you're looking for now. It might not come up yet, and likely shouldn't, but you should have this idea from your budget earlier.
Only contact sellers if you're interested in actually buying the car. Showing and testing a used car takes time, and the seller doesn't want to hold on other offers if you're not serious.

, Any damage or wear can factor in to the price, so compare this against the asking price. Ask why the vehicle is being sold. Make a note of this information to compare later against the actual facts as they evolve.


If the seller is unable or unwilling to give any of this information, go ahead and walk away. This is a huge red flag.

, The time should work for both of you and the meeting should be in a public area if you do not know the seller. You should prepare for this meeting by having all your information and questions ready. Keep the seller apprised of any changes in your schedule for the meeting.


Only meet the seller if you can also see the car. If they just want to meet in person, they're wasting your time.

, If you don't know a lot about auto mechanics, brings someone along with you for the best results. Private sellers may keep records of any repairs or maintenance done on the vehicle, and this will tell you the general health of the car. If they do not know the history, you'll absolutely need to do a thorough check through the DMV.


Ask if they have made any modifications (""mods"") to the car, and who did them.
Ask, at the very least, for the mechanical history of the car since the current owner bought it.
If they made repairs or changes themselves, it is up to you whether or not you trust them.

, The DMV has a record of any accidents involving the car, as does CarFax.com, so that you can do a more detailed search. Use the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), located on the steering column in the interior, on the engine, or etched on the windshield, to get specific car information.


The most likely location of the VIN is on the lower left-hand corner of the windshield (looking from the driver's seat).

, Check the body for obvious damage or signs of previous heavy repairs, the tires for any obvious defects such as cracks or under-inflation or excessive wear, and the engine for any signs of physical damage. Use a small pocket magnet to find areas ,where plastic putty was used to repair body damages. A paint thickness tester with a digital display will help to detect clunkers. Be aware of the fact that private sellers are not prevented in any way from selling damaged cars, and can hide the origin of the car through title washing, a process of selling a car and re-registering it in a new state., Mineral deposits, discoloration, water stains on the interior, strong odor from cleaners, or deposited flotsam are all sure indicators of water damage. Any water damage to the engine or interior of the car is likely to leave the car totaled.

, Check in the wheel wells, the rockers, the floorboards, and trunk. Repairing or reversing rust is an expensive process. Indicators of shoddy bodywork include mismatched paint, use of plastic or fiberglass filler, or gaps between body panels.

, The odometer is generally reliable, but wear on seat upholstery and the pedals are sure indicators of use as well. You should be alert when you find new pedal rubbers! The Kelley Blue Book offers a calculator for the price impact of mileage. Have this calculator handy. Note, however, that Kelly Blue Book prices will vary from zip code to zip code, so check prices in your own town, not where you buy the car.

, If they are worn unevenly, the car may need front end repairs to the alignment, shocks, tires or tie rods. While replacing the tires can be relatively inexpensive, any obvious and significant damage would make the car unsafe to test drive.


A new set of tires can be a potential red flag -- as this is an odd expense to pay before selling the car. Make sure you pay specific attention to braking and handling when test driving.

, Batteries are cheap and easy to replace. If the terminals are corroded it is an indication of poor maintenance. Avoid test driving the car if the battery appears too corroded, it could spark or start a fire.

, Make sure there is no oil on the air filter, or near the air intake. This could indicate blown pistons or other engine damage. If you are unsure of how to check this, have an experienced mechanic show you. Again, a brand new air filter can be a red flag, as it might be a way to cover or postpone engine failure. That said, these cheap parts are easy to replace and should be replaced often, so as long as it's not brand new without an explanation you should be fine.

, The oil from the dipstick should be black and free from grit. The coolant should not have any particulate matter in it, or be sludgy or brown. This indicates serious issues with the engine that make the car unsafe and costly to repair.


If the oil is red or green it is probably brand new. Again, if the seller is not upfront about this it can be a red flag that she/he is hiding bigger issues.

, It should smell sweet and have little particulate matter. Burnt orange or brown fluid means it hasn't been changed in a long time. Avoid test driving the car if there are issues with the transmission, as it locking up or otherwise breaking could cause an accident. This is for automatic transmissions.


For a manual transmission, check the clutch master cylinder for leaks etc; and the clutch pedal it shouldn't feel either too stiff or too loose. Does the shifter hang up or pop out of gear? Those would be deal enders for me.

, Run the heat and the air conditioning to see how well they run. The air conditioning may need coolant to improve cooling. The fan should blow without any obstruction or excessive noise.

, Drive as you normally would, for a period of time that is sensible. This includes freeway and city driving. Keep an eye on the engine temperature, ease of steering and the ease of shifting gears, as well as the status of check engine light. You can monitor the gear shifts by observing the tachometer’s rise and fall with acceleration. Many minor repairs can be accomplished relatively quickly . Keep the stereo off so that you can listen into the car for dangerous sounds or unwelcome noises. You can test the sound system, but make it quick.
Try to drive, if possible, at a variety of speeds and locations. Get on a near highway and open it up, then try to slower, more precise turning on slower roads.

, Unlike with a dealership, you must handle all the required paperwork to purchase the car. You can contact your local DMV to secure any papers needed to pay sales tax, transfer the title and registration, and any other legalities involved in purchasing the car . Ensure that you have established the source your financing, either through earnings or a loan, before you attempt to buy the vehicle.


If the seller doesn't have the title in hand, walk way. Don't accept stories about it being lost or gone. Similarly, make sure you have your cash and any required paperwork ready.

, In some states, emissions tests are required before the sale of a vehicle, and this will allow you to catch any issues you might have missed during your test drive. The seller should be receptive to this if not, walk away from the deal because this is an indication of major needed repairs.

, Although you may be accustomed to fixed prices, this an occasion where you often have leverage and can offer a below Blue Book valuation.. Negotiation is acceptable in this situation, and if you have cash on hand, you can pressure the seller to a lower price.


Consider the incentives of the seller. The seller often is motivated to sell the car privately because of a poor offer from a dealership. The seller is generally aware of the market value of the car and generally willing to sell below that value. You can use this to your advantage in negotiating the price., If your seller accepts your offer, fill out and mutually sign all the required paperwork, and make the payment. This should be sufficient to temporarily secured the title until you get the car legally registered in your name . If you are stopped by police without this under your name, the car may be considered stolen.

This website will tell you when an auction is taking place and its location.Other good websites include governmentauctions.org and gov-auctions.org. These are privately-run sites that contain information about government auctions.
You will have to create an account to use the privately-run websites. Many offer free trials, but you will have to pay when your free trial ends.;
, Search “auto auction” and look for websites that have repossessed and seized cars for sale. Not all auto auction websites will. Instead, some specialize in antiques or estate sales. At the website, you should be able to peruse inventory.

Avoid websites that require you to pay money before you can inspect a vehicle., These magazines often list auctions and seized cars for sale. However, be aware that sometimes the cars advertised aren’t the same as the cars you’ll see at the auction.Your local paper should also contain information about upcoming local auctions.

, Law enforcement might let you check out their cars, so call up and ask. They usually store cars at towing yards, and the police might let you go inspect what stock they have available., Some banks or credit unions will let you look at their file of repossessed vehicles. You’ll be able to inspect a car and then make a bid for it. Lenders usually want to recoup their losses, so you can often get a good deal this way.However, you’ll probably pay more than you will at an auction., You can get a great discount from one of these sellers. Search online to find nearby sellers. You can buy a car without the high-pressure auction environment, which should give you more time to research the car.Nevertheless, you’ll pay more than you would for a similar car at auction., Bank and auction sites should have a list of cars available.Check if there’s anything offered you are interested in. It’s great to get a car cheap, but there’s no reason to buy a sports car when what you need is a minivan. Identify the types of cars you are in the market for., The difference between these reasons could potentially tell you a little more about the car. Typical reasons include:

Seized car: This means the car was taken by law enforcement for either too many traffic violations or because it was confiscated in a raid. The car was most likely maintained by the owner before being seized. The IRS and courts tend to seize cars that have a higher value and are of better quality.
Repossessed car: These cars are seized by lenders who haven’t been receiving payments. Since the former owner couldn’t repay their loan, they probably didn’t pay to maintain the car. These cars tend to be of lower quality.Previously-owned government car: These cars were owned by government agencies that no longer need them. Most agencies frequently update their cars, so they tend to be high quality.

, You might be able to inspect the car the day of the auction or before. Try to go before. When checking the car, look for new paint, dents, or rust. Each of these could hint at underlying problems.

Look under the hood if you know what to look for. If you don’t, ask a friend to go with you to see if the engine is in good shape.
Vehicles are shown in the same condition that they were seized. So don’t be surprised if they are dirty inside., Many cars come with CarFax reports to give you the car’s full history, which should include information about prior accidents and repair. If you don’t get a CarFax report, you can run a report yourself using the VIN number. Visit the CarFax website., You might be able to get a car for a great price. However, there are some downsides that you should be aware of before you bid for a car at auction.

For example, most cars are sold “as is,” meaning that no warranty or guarantee is made about the car.In fact, many cars may be in terrible condition. Check if you can buy a warranty separately.You also probably can’t test drive the vehicle, so you really won’t know with certainty what type of car you’re buying.

, Decide which vehicles you will bid on, and then come up with the absolute maximum you will bid for the car. If you’re having trouble setting the price, then look at sources such as the NADA guide.

Also look at eBay to see how much people are paying for auctioned vehicles. Find cars with the same make and model as the cars you want to bid on., Generally, you need to have cash on hand or be preapproved for a loan in order to buy a car at auction.However, some banks will have finance options available if it is a bank auction, so call ahead to check.You might also use a credit card, which is safer to carry than cash.,, You’ll need some way to get the car off the lot. Don’t assume you’ll be able to start it. Many cars sit on the lot for a long time before auction. You may need to bring tools, oil, antifreeze, and an air pressure gauge.

You may also need to tow the car home, so check if a two truck is nearby.Some auctions might also let you pay to store the car until you can get the car off the lot.

, Remember not to go over your maximum for each car. It’s very easy to get caught up in the excitement of an auction, so try to restrain yourself.Ask a friend to come along with you to help keep you in line., If your bid was the highest, congratulations—you’re the new owner! You need to make a deposit immediately after winning.The deposit amount will be roughly 10% of the price.

If you back out of the sale, then you’ll forfeit your deposit.

Buy with confidence!",How to Buy a Reliable Used Car," These cars cannot be sold without undergoing testing and inspections to make sure all components function properly.While these vehicles may cost more, you can be sure of getting a reliable vehicle without having to do a great deal of research.


Be aware that not all cars sold at dealerships are certified.
Check the sticker to see if the car is “as is”. This means the seller makes no guarantees as to the vehicle’s condition. Any repairs will be your responsibility.;
, You can look up dealer reviews online at sites like Car.com, Edmunds, or Dealer Rater. A good dealership will provide the vehicle history report and service record for their used cars for no additional cost.

, Private owners typically list their cars in the newspaper or on craigslist. You can often get the best deals here, but you must be extra vigilant if you want to locate a reliable car.

, Use a trusted site like Kelley’s Blue Book, Consumer Reports, or Edmunds to look up information about the models you are interested in. Avoid models that have a history of complaints, recalls or functional problems.

, This report will tell you whether the car has been in a significant accident or had the odometer rolled back.


You will need the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to order the report. It is often located inside the drive side door jam or on the driver side dash. If the report is negative, do not by the car.

, This will tell you how much people in your area are paying for the car and protect you from paying too much.

, You can get a feel for how trustworthy you think he or she is. You can also save a lot of time by asking a few questions before you show up to test-drive a car. If the seller is evasive or the answers unsatisfactory, you may want to look elsewhere. Be sure to ask:Why are you selling?
Does the car need any repairs?
Has it ever been in any accidents?
How many people have owned the car?
Do you have all the records? Can you provide them?
Can I have a mechanic examine the car prior to purchase?

, Never buy a car without the title. It is what establishes your legal ownership of the vehicle. The service records will show if the car received its scheduled maintenance on time.

, Look for obvious damage such as dents and scratches on the body, rust or cracks in the windshield, but also be aware of less obvious signs the car has been in an accident:Body panel colors that do not match (often a sign of a major repair).
A fresh paint job (often used to conceal rust).
Misaligned seams where the trunk, hood, and doors closed (a sign that the car may have been in a serious accident).
Steel panels repaired with filler. A small magnet should adhere to all steel parts.

, If the tires need to be replaced, then you can negotiate a lower price to cover the cost. Tire wear may also reveal alignment or suspension problems.Look for:


A reputable brand name (Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear).
All of the same make.
Free of any cuts, bubbles or cracks.
Worn evenly (uneven wear indicates an alignment or suspension issue).
New tires on a low mileage car (a sign that the odometer may have been rolled back)., Most obviously, the car should rest levelly. But don’t be shy about testing it to check for less obvious problems, as suspension repair is very costly.Make sure:


No creaking noises are produced when you bounce the vehicle’s corners.All corners respond the same to bouncing.
When you tug back and forth on the top of each front tire, there should be no play or clunking or ticking sounds, which indicate the wheel bearing or suspension joints need repair., Cars whose frames have been damaged and then straightened are less safe in an accident. Look under the car, under the hood, and in the trunk. Make sure no part of the chassis is bent or cracked, and look for signs of post-accident straightening:A door or trunk that does not open and close easily.
Holes or gashes on the frame, where a straightening machine was attached.
A replacement hood, trunk, or doors.
Welding marks under the hood.
An inconsistent finish, caused by repainting after repairs.

, A cracked block or blown gaskets will likely cost more to repair than the car is worth. Make sure:


It is free of fluid or oil leaks.
The oil filler neck is not coated with thick, black deposits.
The battery terminals are free of corrosion.
The oil dip stick is free of dark, black oil.
The radiator fluid is not foamy and has not oil droplets in it. This is a sign of a defective head gasket or cracked block or cylinder head, allowing coolant and oil to mix.There are no odors while the engine is running.
The exhaust is neither blue (burning oil) or black (excessive oil consumption).
Be aware: an extremely clean engine may have been cleaned recently to remove signs of leaks. Be sure to check it again after the test drive.

, You want to be sure the car is easy to get in and out of, comfortable, and has not obvious problems. More importantly, you want to make sure there is no flood damage, which not only harms the interior, but also damages the engine in a number of ways. Never buy a car that has suffered flood damage. Be sure to check for:


Cracked or overly worn seats. Mineral deposits will result in seat discoloring and indicate flood damage.
A heavy scent of air freshener, which may be concealing engine smells, cigarette smoke, mold or other unwanted odors.
Broken gauges.
Illuminated warning lights.
A functioning stereo (damaged electronics may indicate flood damage).
A heater and a/c system that work.
Windshield wipers that work and fluid that dispenses properly.
Functioning seatbelts.
Seats that adjust properly.
Functioning window and sunroof (if applicable).
Car alarm that works (if applicable).
Trunk and diver-side door that lock and unlock with the key.
Headlights and hazards that work properly.

, This will allow you to hear engine noise, squealing belts, etc.

, If you will commute by highway or are planning on long road trips, be sure to get the car up to highway speed. If you will be driving in the mountains, find a steep hill to drive up.

, This is easiest to do when getting on the highway. You want to be sure the car has adequate power to get up to speed and merge safely. In addition, be alert to signs of engine or transmission problems:


Make sure the car downshifts swiftly and smoothly. Sudden loss of power, clunking sounds, or a delay or engine revving before a shift indicates a worn clutch.Listen for excessive engine noise.

, Clunking noises and grinding when in reverse are signs of a worn transmission., This is easiest to do in a parking lot or when coming to a stop sign. First make sure no cars are behind you. You don’t want to be rear-ended during your test drive. Make sure:


The vehicle does not pull to one side when braking (indicates the brake pads are wearing unevenly or the break fluid needs replacing).There is no grinding or squealing noise when applying the breaks (indicates worn break pads).
The break pedal does not vibrate (indicates warped rotors or poor vehicle alignment).The wheels do not lock (if the car has antilock breaks).

, The steering should be easy and responsive. The ride should be smooth. Make sure:


The car does not drift to one side.
The steering wheel does not shake or vibrate excessively, particularly when turning (indicates problems ranging from an unbalanced tire to a slipping belt to a loose steering rack).There is no resistance in the steering wheel when turning (indicates low power steering fluid or other problems).
There are no strange noises when turning: clicking, clunking or squealing (often indicates a failed power steering pump).
The car does not bounce when going over bumps (a sign of suspension failure).The car does not dip in front when stopping (another sign of suspension failure)., The dipstick is usually in the rear of the engine compartment. The fluid should be bright red to light reddish brown. Dark brown, black, or mustard colored fluid, or a strong burned smell, can indicate a major transmission problem., Your own inspection and test drive can identify obvious problems, but a mechanic can find dozens of things you might miss.

,, Be sure to ask what repairs he or she recommends, what repairs he or she anticipates in the coming years, and in particular, what repairs the car needs in order to pass inspection for registration in your state. If the car does need repairs, you may be able to negotiate with the seller for a lower selling price.

, If your car comes back with a clean Vehicle History report, aces your inspection and test drive, and gets a clean bill-of health from a trusted mechanic, then you can be confident you are purchasing a reliable car.

Be Nice!,
Know what you want.,
Do not claim to be a ""Cash Buyer"".,
Do not accept the first offer.,
Know when to stop.,
No Dutch auctions.",How to Get the Best Deal on Your Next Car," Do not underestimate how much you can get the salesperson on your side by being polite and friendly. The salesperson can be your best ally in the final battle for supremacy that is to come when you finally face the Sales Manager. Give the salesperson ""attitude"" and he may offer you an awful deal just to get rid of you.;
, Do your homework and have a very clear idea of what you want, what you need and how much you have to spend. Be open minded, but do not be sold on a car that the dealership needs to get rid of if it is not right for you.

, There is a huge misconception that telling the dealer you are paying cash will get you a handsome discount. It will not. In fact, it may actually turn the salesperson off as it could affect their finance commission percentage and the deal could actually cost the salesperson money. Dealerships can make huge money on finance commission and can be under huge pressure to hit finance targets. Your cash deal, especially toward the end of the month, simply may not be worth them doing.

, This is the opening gambit where the dealer will try to hit all his targets in one go. Look at the offer in detail and find out what is included in the quote. There may be a large amount of products ""stacked"" into this offer that you do not want or need. Find out what they are offering the car at and work from there.

, When you reject the dealer's first offer make a counter offer that is lower than you would expect to pay based on the opening offer. The dealer will come back with an offer that is higher than your counter offer but lower than the original offer. This is where you should go in for the kill. You now know the figure he will not accept and one that you know he will. You now decide what price you will buy at between these two amounts and make the commitment at that price. Stick to this price and be prepared to walk away. Trust me, they will never let you walk at this point but don't show any weakness of will.

, Every dealer will try to gain some level of commitment before offering you a deal and they expect a negotiation. Unless they are really desperate though, you will win no favours by repeatedly playing one dealer off against the other. By all means get a second offer and go back to the original dealer with a written quote and ask them to beat it if it is lower. Be aware though, you will be asked to commit to buy the car if they can beat the quote you have come armed with. Don't then go back to the other dealer with that quote and start all over again as you may not like the reaction and you jeopardise the quality of service you will receive in future.

The shinier your car, the more money you can get for it, so think about putting on a coat of wax.Be careful when vacuuming. Depending on your car’s age, the vacuum could pull fabric away from the seats and the interior ceiling.;
, Detailing goes beyond merely washing your car. Instead, someone will thoroughly clean your car, inside and out, using a variety of products and tools. When you have a car detailed, you are returning it to show-quality cleanliness.


Shop around to get a good deal. Detailing typically costs around $150.You probably don’t need to do this if your car is a clunker. In that situation, it’s probably best to simply drive it to the dealership and take your chances.

, You want to remove dents without painting them, which would reduce your car’s value. Get dents removed by taking the car to a shop. It might only cost around $100.Have your car buffered to eliminate small scratches. If the scratches are larger, it’s probably not worth it to get an entirely new paint job for the car., New bolds are cheap to buy. You can easily replace burnt out bulbs with a screwdriver. Changing your bulbs is a cheap way to increase your car’s trade in value., Did you smoke in your car? Store trash in the trunk? If so, you need to clean out these smells. Get an ozone generator to remove gag-inducing odours., Generally, you shouldn’t spend the money to replace your tires. However, it’s a good deal to buy used tires if your current set has absolutely no tread left., Most guides require that you estimate the condition of your car—excellent, good, fair, or poor. Very few cars are in good condition and almost none are in excellent. Be honest with yourself and examine your car critically. Consider the following:Excellent. The car should be brand new and not have had any paint jobs or bodywork. Both the interior and the engine should be clean.

Good. The car should be rust-free or have minimal rust. The paint job should be shiny, and the interior and exterior should have few apparent defects, such as scratches or dings.

Fair. Your car probably has rust and other defects, though the defects should be repairable. The tires probably also need to be replaced.

Poor. The car has mechanical issues which can’t be repaired, and it probably also has severe rust.

, You need to know the car’s value before going into negotiations. There are many websites you can search for the car’s value. Popular websites include Edmunds.com, Autotrader.com, and Kelley Blue Book.Remember to find the car’s “trade” value. This is what you are likely to get from a dealer., You might be able to get a better deal if you have a complete set of maintenance records.Go through your paperwork and see if you can find everything.

, To really get a good deal, you need to separate the trade-in from the purchase of your new car. For example, you might want $10,000 for your car, but the dealer offers only $8,000. To make you happy, they can give you $10,000 but then increase the interest rate on your loan.Prevent this from happening by shopping for a car loan before you go to the dealership.


Visit your bank or credit union and ask whether you qualify for a car loan. They will need to pull your credit score and credit history.
Take your approval with you when you go to the dealership., Unscrupulous salespeople like to play games. They’ll hold onto your registration and license to try to get you to buy a car. Before heading out, make a copy of your license and registration to give the salesperson, but don’t part with the real things., If you show up at the lot with a completely empty car, you’re sending a signal that you’re ready to buy.Leave some larger personal items in the car.


For example, a student can put some books and notepads in the back seat.
If you’re a parent, you can put the child seat in the back along with blankets and toys.

, You might not like to negotiate, so ask a friend who isn’t afraid to negotiate to come along with you. You can say they are your partner or sibling and let them negotiate on your behalf. At a minimum, they can offer moral support.

, Negotiating can be emotional, and you might be better off calling ahead of time.Describe your car briefly and ask the salesperson for their best quote. Who knows—someone might offer you the amount you are hoping to get.


Avoid setting up appointments to meet with someone. This is simply an invitation to come negotiate in person.

, When you go to the dealership, you should avoid negotiating the price of your trade-in until you nail down the price of your new car. The salesperson might give you a good deal on your trade-in, but they’ll simply increase the amount you pay for the new car.If the dealer asks if you have a trade in, you can insist you don’t. Then you can change your mind.For example, you can say, “You know what? Maybe I do want to trade in my car.” Smile and shrug your shoulders.

, You want the dealer to know that you aren’t a pushover. Instead, let them know you’ve done some basic research by saying, “I saw my car was listed as having a $10,000 trade-in value on Autotrader.com”The number you quote should be the highest you think you can get. Realize that you might have to go lower in order to close the deal.

, You can expect the salesperson to make a lowball initial offer. Don’t be offended—and don’t be afraid to negotiate. A good idea is to ask them to explain why they think the car isn’t worth much.


For example, you can say, “I think $6,000 is a little low. Why don’t you think it’s worth $10,000?” Expect the salesperson to point out the flaws in your car.

, Try not to budge too much from the amount you quoted. Instead, point out why your car is worth the amount you want. For example, the dealership might offer $6,000. You can say, “I agree the car is scratched on its bumper, but that can be fixed. It’s still in great condition, so I’d like close to $10,000.”


At this point you can pull out your service records and show what great condition the car is in.

, Your strongest bargaining chip is your ability to walk away. The dealer will lose out on selling you a new car. Also, used cars are profit centers, and the dealer will lose out on your trade-in as well. Let the dealer know you’ll be showing the car to other people.


For example, you can say, “Is that your best offer? I’ve got to write it down so I remember it when I drive over to other dealer across town.”

, Don’t fell rushed to fill up silence by lowering how much you’re willing to accept for your trade-in. Instead, let the silence just sit there. Pretend to polish your car or look toward other cars on the lot and wait for the salesperson to say something.

, At some point, you and the dealership will reach a stalemate. They’ll make their best offer for the trade-in. At that point, you should feel free to say, “I need to go shopping around. I’ll be in contact with you later.”


Remain polite and don’t let the salesperson bully you. If the salesperson pushes back, say, “I’ve got a meeting I need to be at.”

, See how much they are willing to give you for the car. You’ll have to go through the negotiations all over again, which can take time. However, if you want the best deal available, then shopping around is definitely worth your time. Ideally, you should visit at least three dealers.The amount a dealer offers depends in part on their inventory on the lot. For example, you might get a low offer if a dealer has several same-model used cars already on their lot.

Ask to see the title.,

Note heavy perfumes.,
Feel for dampness.,
Look for dark lines on fabrics.,
Look for rust.,
Look for new parts.,
Obtain a history report for the vehicle.,
Shop at a reputable dealer.",How to Detect Water Damage in a Used Car Before Buying," Many states require that the vehicle's title indicate or be ""branded"" in such a way that it conveys that the vehicle has been submerged, much the same way it would be marked if it was ever used as a taxi, police vehicle or sold as ""salvage"" or ""rebuilt"". The first two are self-explanatory. The last, are not quite as apparent. A salvage vehicle is usually a vehicle that has been a ""total loss"" to an insurance company due to accident, fire, submersion, etc. These vehicles may also have been sold as ""repairable wrecks"" and have been restored to at least look like the original, but may have other problems. They are often purchased from salvage yards or directly from the insurance company, rebuilt and offered for sale. These vehicles have ""rebuilt"" titles. Be wary of vehicles that are marked as any of these types (the terminology for different types of vehicles may vary from region to region). These vehicles should be thoroughly checked by a trusted mechanic before purchasing.;
, Musty smells are indications of moisture. It is not unusual for older cars to have some mustiness - but beware. Water may have gotten into a vehicle if a window was left down or was broken. Rotted sheet metal around the rear wheels or rear window can cause a musty smelling trunk., The presence of perfumes (or other ""air fresheners"") might be an indication of an attempt to mask musty smells., Press your hand into carpeting under seats, as it would require seat removal to effectively remove moisture there. If no carpeting is present in the cabin, find an edge of rubber liner on floor and peel back to expose metal floor. Look for wetness, as it is difficult for moisture to evaporate when trapped between steel and rubber or vinyl. In the trunk, carefully reach into the area behind both of the rear wheels (if accessible). Check the spare tire storage space as well. Water will collect in these low spaces., Water lines or marks are created at the ""high water points"" on fabrics. A continuous line should be visible along the length of any fabric (seats, rugs, headliner, etc.) that has been exposed to water and air at the same time., Rust will occur on any unpainted steel surface that is exposed to water. Since the inside of the trunk should never be exposed to water - rust found there is a sign that is was. Likewise, any rust found anywhere inside the cabin means water got in there, too., Pay particular attention to the dashboard instrumentation. As mentioned above, if the odometer indicates a very low value for the year of the vehicle - it could indicate that the instrument cluster or entire dashboard was replaced due to water damage., The manufacturer or dealer may have some or all of this information available for free. Carfax is a service provider that maintains a database of many types of repairs and damages to vehicles, for a modest fee. Supply the VIN (it should be clearly visible through the windshield on the driver's side dashboard), or the license plate state and number (if currently registered) for look up in the online database., Reputable dealers do not want the headaches of selling vehicles that have questionable history. Dealers rely on their good reputation to stay in business. ""Unhappy customer"" stories spread much, much faster than ""happy customer"" stories, so most dealers do what they can to minimize this risk.

Identify the year, make and model of the car.,
Determine the trim of the vehicle if possible.,
Look up the blue book value based on what you know.,
Reduce the figure provided by fifty percent.",How to Determine the Value of a Salvaged Car1," The value of a vehicle can be effected by a number of variables, but the most important information to start with includes the year, make and model of the car. Locate this information in the car’s owner’s manual or on the salvage title itself.The value of a car can vary significantly from one year to the next, so it’s important to identify specific information about the vehicle.
The title should provide all of this information.;
, Many cars can be purchased in a variety of trim packages. These trim levels determine things like interior accommodations, engine size and suspension components, as well as the appearance of the car. The trim may be indicated on the title, or it may be included in the name of the car.Some automakers like BMW include the trim in the model. The BMW 3 Series comes in a variety of trims indicated by the numbers after the 3; such as the 318 or 335i.
Other automakers will add letters to the model to identify the trim such as a Chevrolet Cobalt LT.
You may be able to find guidance on the automaker’s website to better identify the trim of the vehicle.

, There are a number of websites that will allow you to enter the information you’ve gathered in order to see the current market value of the vehicle if it did not have a salvage title. Use one of these sites to determine what the car would be worth with a normal title.Look up the value of the vehicle on a website like www.KBB.com, www.Edmunds.com or www.NADAGuides.com.
Be sure to include information regarding options the car has such as a sunroof, CD player or alloy wheels.

, Once you have determined the market value of the vehicle if it had a normal title, take that figure and divide it in two (or reduce it by fifty percent) to establish an estimated value for the car with a salvage title.This method will only give you a ball park value for the vehicle.
Insurance companies often will reduce the value by 75 to 80 percent instead of 50 for claims purposes.

Contact a local automotive repair facility.,
Transport the vehicle to the repair facility.,
Provide any information about the damage and repair.,
Have the shop provide you with an estimate.",How to Determine the Value of a Salvaged Car2," In order for the vehicle to have a salvage title, it means it must have been repaired by a certified repair facility and inspected to ensure the car was road-worthy. Contact a local repair facility that you trust and ask them if they would be willing to inspect the vehicle to determine its value and the quality of the repairs.Some repair facilities may specialize in certain work and be unable to assess the entire vehicle.

, In order to accurately assess the vehicle, mechanics will need to be able to go through it fairly thoroughly, which means putting the vehicle on a lift and spending some time with it. The best way to ensure they can get an accurate idea of the quality of the repairs of the value of the vehicle is to bring it to them to inspect.If the vehicle can be legally driven, do so, otherwise you may need to have it towed.
If you are unable to bring the vehicle to the repair facility, you may ask if a mechanic will come with you to inspect it, but they will not be able to be as thorough.

, There are a number of ways a vehicle can be damaged that would result it in being considered “totaled” and then “salvaged.” If you know what the damage was, it will make it far easier for the mechanics to assess the repairs. Water damage, for instance, would require significant interior work and likely a new engine, whereas a serious accident may have resulted in frame damage and repair.Ask the seller to provide you with any information they can about the damage and the repairs conducted.
You can also pay to have the vehicle’s Car Fax report pulled, which will indicate why it was totaled.

, Once the mechanics at the repair facility have gone through the vehicle, they will be able to provide you with a fair estimate of the value of the car, as well as any possible issues you may need to address as a result of the repairs.This estimate will likely be higher than that provided by the insurance company.
The repair facility may also be able to indicate any other potential issues with the vehicle not tied to the title or repairs.

"
"
Gather all the pertinent information you can.,
Contact your insurance company.,
Provide the agent with the information you have.,
Receive a valuation from your insurance company.",How to Determine the Value of a Salvaged Car3," Just as you did to create an estimated value for the car, gather any information you have regarding the year, make, model and trim of the vehicle. Make notes of any options the car has that may increase its value.It’s better to have more information than you need to ensure you can get the most accurate value possible.
You may also need to provide the VIN number for the vehicle.

, Your insurance company will assess the value of your vehicle in order to determine the projected cost to provide the car with insurance coverage. Call your insurance carrier and tell them that you would like to assess the value of a vehicle you are considering purchasing and insuring. They will connect you with an agent that can assist.Your insurance company will need to determine the car’s value in order to calculate what they will charge you for coverage.

, The insurance agent will ask you a number of questions regarding the vehicle. Tell them everything you are able to in order to establish the most accurate estimate possible.If you aren’t sure of an answer, tell them so. It’s better to be accurate.
If you know any information about the repairs that were done to the car, that may help.

, Once the insurance agent has calculated the information you provided against the equation they use to determine values for salvaged vehicles, they will provide you with their valuation of the car.This valuation will likely be much lower than those established by estimates or even the market.
The insurance value may be lower than the asking price, particularly if it is a rare or exotic vehicle.

Do the math.,
Determine how much you spend in maintenance costs.,
Determine your budget.,
Factor in less obvious costs.,
Determine gas mileage differences between new and old.,
See how long you can drive the car.,
Save money on regular maintenance costs.,
Consider whether it’s worth a major repair bill.,
Be honest about your DIY abilities.,
Determine the car’s market value.,
Lower car costs if you do purchase.,
Consider your peace of mind.,
Consider professional factors.",How to Decide Whether to Keep or Replace Your Car," Calculate how much you are paying in car repairs every single month. Compare that to the cost of a new car. Consider the age and mileage of the car.


New cars typically depreciate about 22 percent in the first year. Most people keep their car about six years before trading it in. Whether your car is paid off or not makes a difference because, if it's paid off, you will be able to take the value of the car off the purchase price of a new one.
Calculate the monthly cost of your car, including fuel, insurance, and the repairs. It’s a trickier question if your car is costing you money to repair and you haven’t paid it off yet. Then, you need to consider how much you would get if you traded it in. Compare this figure with the costs of a new car. Which is more?
Consider insurance costs. It’s usually more costly to pay insurance and registration fees on a newer car.;
, A few hundred dollars every month in regular maintenance on your used car might actually be less than a car payment, even if you purchased a used car.


Keep in mind that new vehicles will have some maintenance costs too, just not as many, especially if they are on warranty. But you will still need to change the oil, perhaps the tires, the brakes, or change a belt, and things like that.
How regular are your maintenance costs? If you've had one big repair, but it's something that should keep the car running for some time, that might make driving your old car longer worth it.
However, if the car is starting to nickel and dime you with repair costs for small things on a regular basis, and those costs are more than a new car payment would be, the math points you toward the new car.

, A lot of this depends on your own personal budget. Budgeting is simple. How much money do you bring in, and how much money do you spend per month?


Financial advisers say you should not spend more than 22 percent of your net pay on a new vehicle’s costs. If buying a new car is easy for you to afford, because your revenue exceeds expenses, it’s probably a much easier call.
If you can’t fit a new car payment into your budget without incurring hardship, you probably should hold onto the old car, unless it's costing you more in repairs to drive it than you would spend on a new car.
Could you afford a newer used vehicle? Consider all options. Calculate the cost of a new vehicle, a leased vehicle, and of a new used vehicle with lower mileage than the one you have now.

, New cars come with more hidden costs than just the sticker price or monthly payment, as do older ones. Make sure to fully calculate all costs of new versus old.


You may have lower insurance premiums, registration fees or even personal property taxes on an older, used car depending on the state.
For example, some calculators include things like the price of a replacement vehicle, the percent sales tax on the purchase, vehicle license cost per year, title mortgage and registration fees, whether you’re financing the down payment amount, the annual percentage rate of financing, the number of months financed, annual insurance cost and miles driven per year.
Other factors include miles driven per year, fuel price per gallon, age of the vehicle in years, and repair and maintenance costs per month., How much gas mileage does your old car get? There are some costs to old cars that add up.


If you got a new car, could you purchase a hybrid? Are you driving around a large gas guzzling SUV, when you have a lengthy commute?
In such a case, you might save a lot of money on gas costs by trading down to a smaller fuel efficient vehicle. It’s also better for the environment.
Use a keep your vehicle calculator. Some online sites have developed calculators that help you determine whether to buy a new vehicle or keep your present vehicle.

, Some people say the most reliable way to save money on a car is to drive it until it drops. This is an intangible consideration, but everything can't be broken down to basic math.


A good rule of thumb is that a well-cared for car can run past the 100,000 mile (160,000 km) mark on the odometer. A new car should be more than a ""want."" Do you ""need"" it?
Do you enjoy your car? Do you like the car you are in, or do you cringe when you have to drive it?
Do you have a long commute? How many hours a day are you inside your car? All of these questions can help you decide whether you should trade it in.

, Consider: Are there ways that you can make keeping your used car less expensive? If so, that may be a better option.


For example, have you paid a dealer or a mechanic too much to change your oil or check your fluids? Can you do these yourself or find a cheaper place?
Have you kept the car up by changing the oil, replacing the filters and tires, taking it in for routine checkups, and so forth?
Ask around. Do you have a mechanic you trust or are you paying too much for routine repairs when other places will do them more cheaply? Maybe you’re being ripped off, and that’s why your repair costs exceed the cost of a new vehicle.

, Let’s say you have a big repair bill you’re facing right now. You need to decide – now – whether it’s worth doing those repairs.


Again, it's a good idea to do the math. If the repair costs less than a single month payment for a new car and your car is paid off, it might make more financial sense to do the repairs.
If the repairs are less than a few months of payments on a new vehicle and you don’t think you will need more repairs soon, go ahead and get them done.
You should consider upgrading to a new car if you start having expensive repairs on your old car every few months. The key is whether the maintenance costs become a regular thing. That’s a problem that indicates you should probably consider getting a new car.

, If you’re able to repair a car yourself, or you have a relative or friend who will do it for dirt cheap or free, that matters.


If you don’t have someone like that to rely on, you’re awful at vetting mechanics, and you have no idea how to repair a car yourself, you might be better off getting a new one.
Do you feel comfortable trying to learn how to do some basic repairs yourself? That also matters. For example, replacing front brake pads is a job that some people can do on their own for about $20, whereas car repair shops will charge about $150.
Believe it or not, but one man in Maine drove a 1990 Honda Accord for one million miles. Honda gave him a new car as a result. The man said he followed his owner’s manual and maintenance schedule. He checked his car’s fluids. He kept his oil over a quart. He replaced the fuel pump, the fans, and the radiator.

, If the repairs are less than half of your car’s market value, then you should probably do the repair.


However, if, for instance, the repairs are, say $1,500 and the vehicle’s market value is $2,000, then doing the repairs is probably not worth it.
Check Edmunds’ True Market Value Calculator or Kelley Blue book to determine the market value of your car.Do you even know your old car’s actual worth? This can matter when you go to trade it in, because the trade-in value will be counted off the price of a new car.
Consider how long the repairs will add to the life on your car. A new engine, for example, can greatly extend the shelf life of some cars. Consider how nice it is to enjoy life without a car payment too!What could you do with that extra $300 or so? Within five years, a new car loses about 50 percent of its value., There are ways you can lower costs when you purchase a car. These are things to keep in mind.


Pay cash if you can. This will lower interest costs on the car, and that will make a huge difference in the overall amount you actually end up paying on it.
Consider buying a used car. It’s best to consider cars under five years old with mileage limits under 100,000, which have had no refurbishing or major accidents, and for which there is a warranty.
They say you should always buy the most house you can afford and the least car you can tolerate, because the value of homes often builds, whereas the value of cars depreciates the second you drive them off the lot.

, You can only put a mathematical calculation on some things, like the cost of repairs. However, there are some costs to a car that are intrinsic. Safety concerns include whether the car has working seat belts or dual front airbags.


For example, do you worry about being safe? Do you have to drive in tough winters with bad tires? Do you drive at night a lot for work? Are you in situations with children where you just can’t risk the car breaking down and being stranded? It might be worth the extra cost then, if there is one.
A newer vehicle is going to be more reliable. That’s worth something. In addition, it will look nicer and ride nicer. Consider how much time you spend in your car.
Research the costs of new cars thoroughly. Might you qualify for a leased car at lesser cost, and does this work for you with the miles you drive? Can you afford a new car, or would the cost of the car payments cut dramatically into expendable income you need?
Can you get a warranty to cover early repairs on a new car, so you don’t have to worry about repairs at all? The key here to some degree is whether you’ve maintained your car well in the first place. If you haven’t, expect more maintenance costs to crop up fast.

, Both your personal situation and plain old math should dictate whether you replace your car with a new one.


Image is one thing, but if your profession requires you to maintain a certain level of professionalism, a new car might matter.
For example, if you’re a salesman, and you think pulling up in a new car can influence your sales, that makes a difference.
Consider whether, professionally, you have time to deal with back-and-forth trips to repair shops constantly. Some people have high-demand jobs or childcare duties that make this more than a simple inconvenience.

Consider your trade cycle history.,
Estimate what you can spend on a down payment if buying, and how much you can spend per month on monthly payments.,
Some leases may allow you to spend less monthly than buying.,
Take all the payments and up front charges and see totals before you decide.

,
Term, options, and next purchase intentions should factor in your decision.,
To save money in the long term, consider buying or leasing a car that's just not new.,
Leasing allows you to have more car now than you would be able to buy for the same dollars.,
Determine the mileage you expect to put on your car while you own it over the next 2-3 years.,
If the average market price is less than the value of the vehicle on the lease, then let the lessor take it back.,
If you're considering buying a used car, the warranty might be either expired or close to expiring so ask about an extended service contract.

",How to Decide Whether to Lease or Buy a Car," Chances are you'll keep the next car about the same length of time as before. If it's long term, 5 or more years, consider buying. You'll generally pay less per year that way. If, on the other hand, you like to drive the latest models, leasing may be cheaper and simpler than buying and trading every 2-3 years. If you are going to use the vehicle as a work truck, for example and are likely to damage the vehicle, consider a commercial lease. Your accountant can provide some tax advantage options.;
, Never put a down payment on a lease, just to lower the monthly payment, only the true administrative fees.

, However, you will probably pay more per year on a long-term purchase, since you are paying for all depreciation. Make sure to ""Bottom Line"" both.

,, It's okay to spend more either way as long as it gets you what you want.

, If it's been well taken care of, you may pay less and still get many good years out of it. Used cars also tend to be cheaper to insure.

, It's often better to simply buy a car that you can actually afford. When you trade in a car you own, you get to keep the 'equity' that you have left, and apply that as a down payment on a new car.

, Make sure that mileage is figured in the lease calculation. If you turn in a lease to the dealer he has no argument as to the value of the car or your rights to potential equity. If the vehicle has ""equity"" it's yours to pocket if you choose.

, Your payments would have been higher if they had known the value to be lower.

Locate the VIN on your car to start the decoding process.,
Find detailed information quickly by entering the entire VIN online.,
Use a service to check whether your vehicle has a history of damage.,
Use the other methods to decode it yourself.",How to Decode a VIN1," You'll need to find a long serial number, usually 17 digits, marked somewhere on your car or truck. It may be in one of several locations. You can read the wikihow article on how to Find Your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) or look in the common locations listed below.Look on the dash at the base of the windshield on the driver's side for a small plaque.
Look for a sticker on the driver's door.
A VIN may also be found in the front of the engine block, easily visible once you open the hood.
On most newer vehicles, some body parts such as fenders and hoods also have the VIN on them for identification and matching parts to the vehicle.
Open the driver-side door, and look at the where the side view mirror would be located if the door were shut.
Older cars may have VINs found elsewhere, such as on the steering column, radiator support bracket, or the left-side inner wheel arch.;
, You can find websites that can decode the VIN of most manufacturers automatically. Try VIN Decoder.net if you're looking for detailed, quickly accessible information.


You can try to find a VIN lookup on your car manufacturer's web site, but it's not guaranteed to have one.
If your vehicle was manufactured before 1980, it might have a nonstandard VIN. If free lookup websites don't work, try a paid service such as CARFAX, AutoCheck, or VinAudit. These should give you a little information for free, but a full VIN decoding will cost money.

, Specialized VIN websites and VIN lookup services exist to see whether your vehicle was involved in an accident, fire, or other damaging situation. You cannot decode this information from a VIN yourself, since the VIN for a vehicle never changes. These services just take advantage of the fact that police and other organizations use the unique VIN to describe a car in accident reports.


First, try the free service at The National Insurance Crime Bureau website.
If you cannot get information for free online, you may need to pay for a Vehicle History Report. This should be included in the VIN report services described earlier, such as VinAudit's.

, Follow the methods below instead if you want to have fun decoding it yourself, or if your vehicle was made by an unusual manufacturer not decodable by a website. Finding out where and when your car was made should be easy, while the other methods may take extra effort.


These codes are fully standardized in North America. Elsewhere in the world, most major manufacturers follow the same standards, but they may use the 9th and 10th characters for different purposes. In North America, the 9th must be used as ""checking code"" to confirm the VIN is real, and the 10th must be used to indicate the year the car was made.

"
"
Use the first character to discover the continent of manufacture.,
Use the first two characters to narrow it down to country and manufacturer.,
Use the tenth character to determine the model year.",How to Decode a VIN2," You can skip straight to the next step to find which country it is made in, but this basic information is easy to check and remember.If the first character is an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H, the vehicle was made in Africa.

J, K, L, M, N, P, or R as the first character means the vehicle was made in Asia. This includes the Middle East. Note that a VIN never begins with a zero or O due to the ease of confusing these two symbols.

S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z indicate Europe.

1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 indicate North America, including USA, Mexico, and Canada.

6 or 7 indicate Australia or New Zealand. Note that nearby nations such as Indonesia or the Philippines are considered part of Asia for this purpose.

8 or 9 indicate South America.

, Many vehicles are made in a different country than the one the manufacturing company is located in. Compare the first two characters of the VIN to an online chart like this one, including the first ""continent"" code described above, and find out where a vehicle was really made.This will also tell you which company made the car.


Some companies use the third digit as well to indicate manufacturer or company division. The first two digits should be enough to identify the country and company, however.

, This method will always work for North American cars, and will often work for cars from other regions. Note that this might be one year later than the car was actually made. A model year of 2008 means the car was probably made either in 2007 or 2008. See below for decoding instructions:A 10th character which is an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H indicate the years 1980 – 1987 in alphabetical order, or the years 2010 – 2017.
J, K, L, M, and N are reserved for model years 1988 – 1992, or 2018 – 2022.
P means the model year is 1993 or 2023.
R, S, and T mean 1994 – 1996 or 2024 – 2026.
V, W, X, and Y mean 1997 – 2000 or 2027 – 2030.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 indicate the years 2001 – 2009 or 2031 – 2039.
A real VIN never contains the letters I, O, or Q. The year code has additional restrictions, never using the number 0 or the letters U or Z.
If you're not sure whether your car is new or old, check the vehicle's 7th character. If this is a number, your vehicle's model year is earlier than 2010. If the 7th character is a letter, the model year is 2010 or later (until 2039).

"
"
Acquire your car company's decoding sheet.,
Use the third character to determine the type of vehicle or the company division.,
Use characters 4 through 8 to decode information on component types.,
Use the 11th character to discover the exact assembly plant.,
Use the 12th through 17th digits to find the serial number or miscellaneous information.",How to Decode a VIN3," For all additional information, such as the make of engine or the exact assembly plant that made the vehicle, you'll need to know the internal system that car manufacturer uses.


If you don't know the car manufacturer, you can look it up based on the second character. Look up the most common manufacturer's code online.
Try to find a VIN lookup service or the VIN decoding sheets on your car manufacturer's website. Failing that, use a search engine to look for ""VIN decoding sheet"" + ""(name of company)"". This may be difficult or impossible for some manufacturers.
Contact the company's support service if they have one and ask about VIN decoding specific to their cars.
Ask an auto service shop if you can see their decoding charts. The workers there use the charts to direct the repairs and adjustments they make., Depending on the manufacturer, the third character of your VIN is used either to narrow down the location further to a company division, or to describe the vehicle's type. Most of the time, this character simply means ""car"" or ""truck"", or provides little information that the country code doesn't, for instance ""made by Honda Canada"".

, These make up the ""Vehicle Description System"" or VDS. According to specific company codes, they describe the vehicle's engine and transmission types, exact model, and similar information.


Technically, the 9th character is also considered part of the ""VDS"" section, but is used to confirm the VIN is real, not to describe a component.

, If you want to know exactly which factory was used to make your car, the 11th digit will tell you. Just like everything else in this section, you'll need to find that company's system to find out more. See the beginning of this section for more details on how to accomplish that.

, Each manufacturer can decide how to use this space for their own purposes.Most commonly, this is a single 6-digit number that tells you the vehicle's serial number.


Some manufacturers never repeat serial numbers, while others start again at 000001 each year.
The 10th through 17th digits are referred to as the Vehicle Identification Section.

"
"
Use an online VIN calculator to quickly confirm the VIN is real.,
Understand the purpose of the 9th character.,
Replace each letter with a number according to the information below.,
Write out the new 17 digit number.,
Write out the following line of numbers underneath, one number below each digit: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.,
Multiply each column of numbers.,
Add each number in your final list together.,
Divide the result by 11 and write down the remainder.,
Check the 9th digit of the original VIN.",How to Decode a VIN4," Use a search engine to find one and enter your full VIN. Remember to use capital letters.


Follow the instructions below if you want to calculate it yourself instead.
Shady used car salesmen sometimes replace VIN stickers to hide a history of damage. Using an online calculator can quickly confirm whether it's a lazy fake, but a smart criminal will use a real sticker from a similar model. This is where you can compare the VIN in the door to the VIN on the dash or on other body components to see if major components have been replaced with used parts or mismatched parts, indicating wrecks or rebuilds.

, The 9th character is a ""check character"" mandatory in North America but commonly used elsewhere in the world as well. This character can be used in a mathematical calculation to determine whether the VIN is fake, and has no other purpose.



Note: The check character will always be a number or the letter X. If it is a different letter, either the VIN was fake, the car was made before 1980 and uses a different standard, or the car was made outside North America and, unusually, the makers decided not to follow the check digit standard.
Write down the 9th character now to check at the end of the calculation, or find it again afterward.

, The first step involves replacing each letter in your VIN with a number that can be used in a calculation. Use the following system, and keep the characters in the same order as you replace them.For instance, if your VIN begins AK6, you should rewrite it as 126.


A and J become 1
B, K, and S become 2
C, L, and T become 3
D, M, and U become 4
E, N, and V become 5
F and W become 6
G, P, and X become 7
H and Y become 8
R and Z become 9
If there is an I, O, or a Q in your VIN, it is fake. Real VINs never use these letters, due to how easy it is to mistake them for a number. You can skip the rest of this method, as you already know the VIN isn't real.

, Leave plenty of space between each digit as well as below the number. Consider turning a sheet of paper sideways so you have the room to write it in one line.

, Keep the exact order listed. Note that ""10"" is one number, and should only go below a single digit.

, Each digit in the top row will be multiplied by the number directly beneath it. Write the results of each problem separately; do not turn them into one long number. Here's an example:


A (fake) VIN with letters turned into numbers as described above: 4 2 3 2 2 6 3 4 2 2 6 3 2 0 0 0 1
The series of numbers to multiply: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Multiply 4 x 8 (the first number in each line) to get 32. Multiple 2 x 7 (the second number) to get 14. Continue until you get the following results: 32;14;18;10;8;18;6;40;0;18;48;21;12;0;0;0;2.

, Add every number you got from the multiplication step together to get one number.


Continuing the example above, we get 32+14+18+10+8+18+6+40+0+18+48+21+12+0+0+0+2 = 247.

, Don't calculate this division problem out to the decimal point, only to the whole number. You can use a calculator, long division or work it out in your head.


'Note"": If the remainder is ""10"", write down an ""X"" instead.
Using the example above, 247 / 11 = 22 remainder 5. Write down 5.
If you're using a calculator that gives you the answers in decimals, and you're not sure how to find the remainder, use an online remainder caculator instead.

, If this is the same as the remainder you wrote down, the VIN is real. Otherwise, the VIN is probably fake. The VIN is definitely fake in this case if the car it belongs to was made in North America after 1980.


Note that, if the remainder is 10, the matching 9th digit of a real VIN will be ""X"", since the manufacturer can't use a two digit number (10) as a checking number.
In our example above, the fifth digit of the original VIN is 2 but our remainder is 5. These numbers are not the same, so the VIN must be fake.

You will be more able to control a new car purchase if you have a specific car make and model in mind to prevent the salesperson from trying to show you every car on the lot. Narrow down your choices so you know the exact car you want and can ask to see only that car.;
,


Determine the actual retail value of the car you want with a resource like Kelley Blue Book before factoring in dealer incentives or trade-in amounts. This will help you control the process of buying a new car by having a clear idea of what the car is worth, so you can tell if a salesperson is asking an inflated amount or trying to sell you a car with features you don't need or want.

,


Call a few dealerships anonymously and get sticker prices for the car you want after you know its market value. You can be in control of the new car buying process by going to the dealerships with the price closest to the market value and the best customer service over the phone.

,


It will be easier to avoid being pressured into a new car package you can't afford if you know how much you can spend. Consider all of your other regular bills, then determine how much you can spend each month for a car payment. Estimate an ideal price and a price you absolutely can't exceed. Write these numbers down and take them with you when you shop for your new car so you stick to those figures.

, Never walk into a negotiation without getting online price quotes. Forewarned is forearmed and this information will help add to your peace of mind when 'sealing the deal'.

, what is the difference between dealer invoice and dealer cost? What is MSRP? What is Holdback? What is freight? etc..

,


Bring a trusted friend or family member with you when you shop for a new car. This helps you control the car buying process, because you will have a witness to verify what the salesperson says and be able to get a second opinion before making any final decisions.

,

Put the features that are most important to you, like fuel economy or safety features, at the top of the list so you focus on these features first when looking at cars. Round out the list with the features you'd like to have, but that aren't deal breakers.

,


The car salesperson you deal with should answer all your questions, pay attention to your concerns and what's most important to you about buying a new car, and take all the time you need to be comfortable and confident with your purchase. Walk away and find another salesperson or another dealership if you have to until you find a sales representative that gives you exactly what you want.

Some SUVs offer the ultimate in extra passenger space—third-row seating—while others offer little more space than a 4-door sedan would.


If your lifestyle calls for transporting a lot of equipment, or 4 or more people at a time, you will probably need a third row of seating.Consider a larger SUV like a Chevrolet Tahoe, or a GMC Yukon.
Some smaller SUVs have third row seating as well, so if you need more seats but don’t want to drive a really big SUV, try a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot.;
, If you will be regularly taking your vehicle off road, consider a Jeep Wrangler.If you want something more highway friendly, try a crossover or a hybrid SUV. For more on those, see below.

, Off-road driving and towing large things like boats will require the power of 4WD. 4WD vehicles offer better traction, and more stability control, which are both great to have when taking the vehicle off-road.Consider a 4WD model if you plan to use your vehicle off road, or even if you live in a place where it snows most months of the year., Do you have kids who might do a number on the interior of your SUV? Or, would you prefer a luxury vehicle? You may need to decide whether you need functionality over luxury.


In terms of luxury SUVs, a Range Rover would be a good option on the smaller end, while an Escalade might be a good choice if you need that extra space.
For a more durable and easier-to-clean interior, consider a Nissan Xterra., With gas prices always fluctuating and often on the rise, fuel efficiency is as important today as it has ever been when considering purchasing a new vehicle.


Kelley Blue Book recently named the 2015 Lexus NX 300h the most fuel efficient SUV, with an estimated 35MPG city and 31MPG highway.Other SUVs that made the top ten list for most fuel efficient include the 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek (29MPG city, 33MPG highway), the 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman (28MPG city, 35MPG highway), and the 2015 Lexus RX 450h (32MPG city, 28MPG highway).

, When it comes to fuel efficiency, hybrid models will usually get you the most bang for your buck, as they combine both electric and gas power.


The Toyota Highlander offers a Hybrid model that also has a third row seat., You won’t want to buy an SUV that will constantly require repairs or maintenance.


A survey of 34,000 drivers on the need for repairs in the first three years of ownership rated the GMC Yukon as needing very little work over that time.One the more luxurious end, JD Power’s Vehicle Dependability Study also rated the Buick Enclave as a highly dependable vehicle in the first three years of ownership., A crossover is essentially defined by the type of platform it is built upon. While a traditional SUV is built using a truck platform, a crossover uses a car platform. So, while this isn’t the only different between SUVs and crossovers, it is one defining characteristic to be aware of when deciding between the two.There are truck/SUV crossovers such as the Honda Ridgeline that offer the interior and space of an SUV as well as a truck bed.The other crossover option is the van/SUV. These include models such as the Kia Sportage, and the Ford Escape. These are especially popular family vehicles, as they often have high safety ratings, and are generous on interior space while not feeling as large or as intimidating as a full-size SUV.Subcompact SUVs, like the 2016 Honda HR-V, are becoming more and more popular on the roads. Their length is more similar to small cars, but they boast an SUV-style body that allows for maximum interior space and versatility, without the hefty fuel price or sizes of full-size SUVs. These subcompact SUVs average about 4MPG more in both city and highway tests than compact SUVs, so they are fuel efficient as well as spacious., As with any car purchase, a high safety rating is definitely a good selling point. Don’t hesitate to ask a salesperson for detailed information on safety features and ratings of a car you are interested in. Alternatively, you can do the research yourself online.


In Kelley Blue Book’s list of the 35 best safety rated SUVs of 2016, the Acura MDX, Acura RDX, BMW X3, and the BMW X5 took the top spots.If you have children, you might also want to look into the child seat attachment availability in the backseat. The 2016 Volvo XC90 was rated the best car for families in 2016 by U.S. News due to its safety ratings, handsfree liftgate, stylish appearance (for those Dads who definitely don’t want to be caught in a Mom-mobile!), and its large cargo capacity., Both luxury and non-luxury vehicles are coming standard with more and more features and upgrades. Know the options available to you with the SUV model you choose.


Many new cars have tech features like in-dash touchscreens, remote start, and even apps that allow you to lock your car from anywhere. Some of these features even address safety issues—back-up cameras allow for safer reversing, blind spot monitoring notifies you (usually with a light in your side mirror) if a car is driving in your blind spot, and some newer model cars even hit the brakes for you to prevent you from hitting an oncoming object."

, The Japanese and Europeans are known for smaller, lighter, lower displacement sports cars, whereas the Americans are known for heaver, higher displacement cars.

, Do you want a highway cruiser? Or a tossable sports hatch? Many 60's and 70's American muscle cars are great on the open road, but would feel too large and ungainly for hill (Touge) racing or autocross racing. Likewise, a small hatchback might be uncomfortable for cruising, especially if it has higher gear ratios and a higher revving engine.

, Investigate magazines like Grassroots Motorsports or join internet forums pertaining to your car. Most, if not all, sports cars have a cult following somewhere, and they can be valuable sources of information. Take www.m42club.com for example, it is a forum dedicated to the BMW E30 318is only.

, Buying locally is generally easier and faster than trying to ship a car over distances.

, Arm yourself with knowledge about the car, and call the owner out if he says anything suspicious. For instance, if he fitted a manual switch for the radiator fan, be wary that the car may have had an overheating problem in the past. Few people would make that sort of modification if nothing was wrong with the stock component. Avoid buying a car that has sat for a while no matter how many times the owner said it ""ran great"" in the past. Always look at a car in the daytime, and it helps to take a friend. During the drive back home, discuss the car, he may have picked up on something you missed.

, The bane of any older car is rust, and it is very expensive to repair. If it comes down to either body rot or mechanical problems, replacing parts on an engine is generally cheaper than having the car taken to a body shop to have panels replaced. Of course, there are exceptions, and if you plan to have the car stripped down and repainted anyway, this may not be a problem. If rust really worries you, buy a car that came from dry, desert climates. When you have bought the car to protect it in the future keep it in a place where water can't get to it (e.g. a garage).

, Once you possess the car of your choice, take some time to make this list. Popular mods include exhaust systems, wheel and tire upgrades, visual styling parts like spoilers and ground effects, and interior upgrades like sound systems, seats, and steering wheels. Make sure the parts you buy were either designed for your car or used successfully on someone else's car.

, Think outside the box when it comes to modifications. Some parts from third party manufacturers can fit many cars. For instance, Bosch fuel injection and electrical components were shared on many cars of the 70's and 80's era like those from BMW, VW, Porsche and Audi. Also, some seats Recaro supplied to various factories can easily be made to fit other cars.

, You eventually want to own a car that can be fun to modify and drive. Autocross races are held all over the United States, check with your local SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) chapter or try a manufacturer specific club like PCA (Porsche Club of America).

Take the vehicle on a test drive.,
Negotiate the price.,
Take precautions when buying secondhand.,
Have an independent mechanic examine the vehicle.",How to Buy a Safe Car," Whether you are talking with a dealer or a private buyer, the vehicle on display will almost certainly have been polished to a high gloss and cleaned thoroughly inside. The seller may even have steam-cleaned the engine and underneath so that, no matter where you look, the vehicle looks great. Never forget that looks can be deceiving! For example, when buying secondhand, it is not uncommon that an unscrupulous seller has matched the undamaged halves from two totaled vehicles and welded them together to give the appearance of a perfect vehicle.;
, Check the safety rating of the make and model through both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Both organizations perform crash tests on all the makes and models offered for sale in America. They grade the performance and publish a list of star ratings. It is in your own interests to buy a vehicle with the highest possible rating. If you are buying a new model, check the latest rating. If you are buying secondhand, check the rating for the year of manufacture.


The auto insurance industry tends to give lower annual premium rates for safer vehicles, so buying a car with the best possible safety rating will keep your insurance costs down as well as keep you safer.

, Again, no matter how good the vehicle looks and what the experts have to say about safety in a crash, you may not like the way the vehicle feels when you drive it. Before you move on to negotiating the price, you should try the vehicle on a journey that matches one of your regular commuting runs or trips to the local mall. It is not enough to drive the vehicle round the block. Go for several miles. If possible, find the opportunity to drive it at speed. Ask yourself how comfortable you find the driving position. Can you reach and move the steering wheel without undue effort? Are the pedals and hand controls easily reachable? You should only consider buying a vehicle if you feel comfortable driving it.

, Figure out whether you can afford the vehicle. It can benefit you to pay a slightly higher price for a new vehicle because it will hold its value and cost you less to own. As a general rule, the higher the star rating the higher the sticker price, but vehicles with higher star ratings are allocated lower auto insurance rates, depreciate more slowly, and cost less in maintenance and repair. Consider these factors when negotiating a price with the dealer.

, There are two major dangers to avoid. The first is that the vehicle has been stolen. You are not protected just because you walk on to a dealer's lot. Dealers can take a vehicle in part-exchange for another without checking the VIN number against the state and national registers. Unless the dealer actually shows you a copy of a report from Carfax Inc. This is not a complete protection against VIN cloning, but it reduces the risk you will buy a stolen vehicle. The second danger is that the vehicle has been totaled and then repaired. In theory, scrapyards break up totaled vehicles for spares, but there are always a few prepared to make extra profit by illegally selling a repaired vehicle. Auto insurance companies always register the vin as belonging to a totaled vehicle when they pay out to the owner. If you are buying from a private seller, always pay for a report on title. It is not a complete protection, but it shades the odds in your favor.

, If you are buying secondhand, you should always ask an independent person with knowledge and experience to check out the mechanical condition of the vehicle before you commit to buying it. This is a necessary protection regardless whether you are buying from a dealer or a private dealer. Only when the independent expert declares the vehicle free from serious problems should you conclude the purchase.

Transfer the vehicle’s title.",How to Buy a New Car Online1," Many dealerships list their inventory online. Look through their website and make a list of vehicles that you are interested in.


There are also dealership aggregator websites and apps, such as autotrader.com that compile and list cars being sold by dealers throughout the country.This is helpful if you already know what make and model of the vehicle you are interested in and want to compare prices.;
, You can either email or call the dealership to inquire about a vehicle you are interested in. The dealer will generally email you back with an offer.


You can also use a live chat option if offered on the dealer’s website.
The quote should include any fees or surcharges included in the online price. If any features come at an extra cost, the salesperson should include this information along with the price to buy a new car.
Email more than one dealer when buying a new car online to get several quotes so that you can compare different prices for the car.

, You will want to compare the quote for the new car with the market value of the car to make sure you're getting a good offer before you buy a new car. Several online sources provide this type of information. You can look up the market value of a car based on the condition of the car, the age of the car, the mileage on the car and your location. The industry standard for this information is Kelley Blue Book.The National Automobile Dealers Association is a great source for this as well.Print copies of the quotes you received from any online car dealer. This will help you stay organized and remember the different prices offered for the vehicle.
If you don’t receive a quote for what you were hoping for, be prepared to negotiate for a better price by conducting research on the vehicle with the exact trim that you are interested in. You may need to leverage how much the dealer paid for the car and the competing quotes from other dealerships. In order to effectively do this, you will need to have done your research on the car and come prepared with quotes from other dealers., If you don’t already have the funds to purchase a vehicle outright, you will most likely need a car loan. While many dealerships offer financing, it may be in your best interest to talk to your bank or talk to online lenders.


Visit your bank or credit union and inquire about a car loan. Find out what the rate will be and whether or not you will qualify.
You can also look into online lenders, through websites such as RoadLoans.com or LightStream.
You can search for a car loan through a big bank, such as Bank of America or Capital One.

, If it is possible, negotiate the price of the vehicle with the dealer. Researching the car's price will help you determine whether or not you have room to negotiate.


If you are looking to negotiate, make sure you get up-to-date quotes from the online car dealer. This may mean going back to the dealers you previously contacted to ask for a new quote. Print the updated offers to take with you when you visit the local dealership.
Conduct extensive research on the vehicle with the exact trim that would like. You can look at Consumer Reports car model pages to learn about the latest pricing on the vehicle.Always be aware of the local MSRP and/or what the dealership paid for the car. You can do this by asking to see the dealership’s invoice for the car.Begin the negotiation with your lowest price.
Conduct yourself as someone who is confident but not argumentative. Explain that you do not want to waste anyone’s time with lengthy haggling and that if you do not come to an agreement on a fair price, you will leave and go to another dealership.Do not mention how you are financing the vehicle or whether or not you have a trade-in until the price of the car is lowered and agreed upon., This is the time for you to test drive the car and make sure you enjoy driving it before you make the purchase.


Carefully look over the car’s interior to ensure that there is no damage. Look at the engine to make sure that is in shape.
Test drive the vehicle to make sure that it is running smoothly and that the brakes are in working order. This is also the time to see if you enjoy driving the vehicle or not.

, Before purchasing the car, you will want to make sure that the car has the features you want by examining the car and comparing what you see to the features listed on your quote.


Many features are not standard in vehicle packages. It is highly likely that you will have to pay more for these features.
Some commonly requested features include sunroofs, moonroofs, navigation systems, heated seats (great for those who live in colder climates), and a leather interior., This process varies from state to state and from one dealership to the next. In almost every case, you'll need to fill out paperwork to arrange for the payment of the car.


The dealership may require certain documents, such as proof of insurance, before you can complete the purchase. Ask the dealer what you will need to bring with you before you go to the dealership to finalize the purchase.

, This is generally handled by the dealership or they will generally provide instruction for how to do it in your state.


Dealerships are able to handle most of the paperwork for you if it is a new car.Depending on state requirements, you may have to fill out a title transfer for your state if you are purchasing a used car. You may also have to include an odometer reading, the vehicle identification number (VIN), and receipt for the sale.These requirements vary from state to state, so it is best to refer to your state’s DMV or Secretary of State website to obtain this information.

Beepi is another website that lets users buy, sell, and lease cars completely online. Consider using a site like this for your new car purchase. Once you find a car that you want, you purchase the car. A Beepi representative will deliver the money to the seller and will then deliver the car to you. You can then test the car for ten days to decide if it is right for you. If you are not satisfied with the car within the ten-day period, you can return the vehicle., Once you have found a car that interests you, inquire about the condition and price of the car.


When corresponding with the seller, ask if they have records of maintenance and if there are any customizations or modifications the seller may have made to the car.

, If you do not have the funds to purchase the vehicle outright, you will need a car loan. Talk to your bank about a car loan or talk to online lenders about obtaining a car loan.

, If you are still interested in the vehicle being sold, arrange a time to meet with the seller in a public place to examine and test drive the vehicle. Be sure to bring a friend or family member as safety precaution.


Examine the interior closely and look for rips or stains in the upholstery.
Examine the exterior for dents or body damage.
Look under the hood of the car to see how the engine looks.
If possible, bring a car-savvy friend with you to assist you with this part. They may know what to look for.

, There are websites that you can use to check if the car has been in an accident or not. You will need the car’s VIN, which stands for Vehicle Identification Number, to look this up.


CARFAX is a popular website to look up vehicle history reports.This service is free if the vehicle is listed on their website. If it is not listed on CARFAX, you may have to pay a fee.
If a vehicle has been in an accident previously, it may not always show up on a vehicle history report. Be sure to thoroughly look the car over before buying.

, If you are satisfied with the car, have researched its history, and you know that you would like to buy it, complete the transaction with the seller. This may be done via check, cashier’s check, an online bank transfer, or cash. Do not send payment electronically if you have not seen the vehicle., You will need to transfer the vehicle’s title into your own name. This is generally done by visiting your state’s DMV or Secretary of State with the seller and working with a state employee to retitle the vehicle.

The ferrite rod antenna in an AM radio uses the property of core material permeability to reduce the length of wire and concentrates the signal.,As an option you can add a variable air capacitor parallel to this ferrite,
antenna, this will give you increased Q that and better frequency selection.,
If you are determined to keep antenna length short (which still means reduced reception) and you have access to electronic-grade ferrite or iron rods, a better antenna than most portable radios can be constructed by going bigger.,
Radio waves are far easier to capture with a copper wire antenna, which is nothing more than a piece of wire stretched between two points, with ceramic, glass, or plastic insulators at each end.,
The wire may be tied directly to both insulators but as various things (like the tree) move over time, the wire will stretch.,
If the long wire doesn't give you an acceptable AM signal, one additional option remains: you can add a loading inductor (a type of coil you can make yourself) before the antenna lead enters the radio.,
A common ham radio trick is to make a loading coil with plastic pipe fittings or pipe and insulated 22 gauge wire.",How to Wind an Aerial for Am Radio," The #61 material rods are widely used for commercial AM (550 KHz to 1660 KHz )To get good reception the radio needs a few micro volts of received signal. Improving weak reception you may increase the mass of this core. Some designs use 5 each rods bundled together and wrapped with the right length of wire.
,, Finally the antenna should be mounted securely inside a PVC pipe to protect it and facilitate aiming this directionally., A good choice is to use a ferrite rod or high carbon steel rod, 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) in diameter and 7 inches (17.8 cm) long. Wind it with 90 turns of insulated 22g wire, which will cover the entire AM band without needing any special tuning, and will also give you additional reception well into the short-wave bands if you need it. A preamplifier is usually a good idea with setups like this., A good AM band antenna can be strung between two trees or across the roof of a house along the ridgeline or over to a nearby tree. A modest twenty-foot length of insulated wire will give your receiver greatly improved reception with far less static than any ferrite antenna can hope for. In part, this is because signal pickup is occurring at a significant distance from the interference-generating appliances in your house. Use good quality ceramic insulators for holding the ends of the antenna wire and ALWAYS add a commercial lightning arrestor (Radio Shack again) where the antenna will attach to the house., This means yearly or even sooner adjustments, so check the tips area for ways to avoid this. Place your arrestor directly above the point where your lines enter the house so that lightning can take the most direct route to ground. For your ground, run a very heavy gauge copper wire straight down from the arrestor to a water pipe, or drive a 6' copper pipe or ground bar directly into the earth there. Then attach the ground wire to your ground with a brass or copper grounding clamp. This same connection also makes an excellent ground for your receiver. A shielded cable lead-in wire (like coaxial cable) can give superior results if your residence has unusually noisy appliances or other EM noise., The vast majority of long wire antennas will be considerably less than a quarter of the wavelength at AM band frequencies and behave as though a small capacitor is connected in series to the wire. An inductor will resonate with this capacity and will increase the overall signal strength significantly. The required inductance range for AM is from about 200 microHenrys (mH) at the high end of the band to about 2 millihenrys at the bottom end of the band for a 20 foot (6.1 m) antenna., For AM radio, you can purchase a 4 inch (10.2 cm) PVC pipe outside coupling which you can pick up at any home improvement store (it will actually measure more like four and a half inches in outside dia), and some 22 gauge insulated wire. The coil is then wound with 100 turns, with taps brought out every ten or so turns by twisting a little loop in the wire. The end result will be the pipe fitting wrapped with a continuous turn of wire and a row of little twists sticking up above and along the coil in a row that you will then strip the insulation off of. The antenna attaches to one end of the coil, and the radio is attached to the other end or to any tap along the length as needed. The total inductance of such homemade inductors is usually around a millihenry, so short antennas may need twelve or more turns instead of the usual ten turns for the last two to four lower frequency taps to raise the overall inductance there. You can use a selector knob and attach the taps to the knob to make a clean little boxed device, or you can just move your radio attachment to the different taps directly to adjust your inductance and give your radio antenna that mad scientist look. Lots of books and resources exist for antenna layout and design if this has struck an interest, but trial and error is how the early radio experimenters did it and it still works today."

Plugging one end into headphone jack will cause any audio you play on your computer to go through the cable. Plugging the other end into the microphone jack will allow whatever you’re playing on your computer to be broadcast to anyone you stream with.You can get the appropriate cable from most music stores or large stores like Walmart.;
, Once you have your cable properly set up, sign into any streaming service that you would normally use to talk to your friends online. This could be something like Skype or Justin.tv or Ustream.tv. If you want to broadcast to more than one person, you’ll need either the premium Skype subscription or to use a streaming service that allows for group chats., Choose the mp3 player you’d like to use to create and play your playlists for your station. You can use something like iTunes or even YouTube to play music. If you're interested in talk radio, you can record your own audio and then play it back directly from your recording software.Because you’ll have a cable plugged in to the microphone and headphone jacks, anyone you stream with will hear the audio you play on your computer. Keep in mind that with your microphone jack occupied, though, you won’t be able to add any live commentary without unplugging it each time.

, If you don’t want to mess around with cables, you can use a subscription website that creates a radio station for you. Radioking.com or airtime.pro only require that you pay for and log in to their services. You choose your audience size, the type of music you want to play, and the website does the rest.This is not necessarily the best option if you want to broadcast something other than music, because you can only choose the types of files that the website provides.

, To create a more professional sounding radio station than what you’ll get with a basic streaming set up, you’ll need software or apps. You’ll need an app to play music or other audio, to turn your audio feed into an audio stream that can be broadcast, and one to act as your server.There are a lot of options for these types of apps and software, but the easiest to work with are Winamp (for playing audio files), Edcast (for turning your audio feed into a stream), and Icecast2 (for your server).

, To broadcast the audio from your computer over a server, you’ll need to download a DLL – which stands for Dynamic Link Library – file. This type of file keeps all of your mp3 files in one place and allows the other software you need to load the mp3s one at a time. This frees up memory and storage space on your computer. For an online radio station, you’ll want to download lame_enc.dll. Type the DLL name into your favorite search engine, followed by “download” and it should pop up.This DLL will allow you to broadcast in mp3 formats, and is also compatible with older players you’re your audience might use.This DLL will download as a zipped version, so you’ll have to open the zipped file to access the individual files you need.

, Because you’re using Winamp to share your audio, you’ll need to insert the DLL file into Winamp’s root directory. This basically makes the audio files on Winamp accessible to the other software you need to broadcast your radio station. To do this, find Winamp in the program files on your computer. Open the Winamp program file (C:/Program Files/Winamp) and insert the DLL file where it asks for the source., Once you have all of the software you need for your radio station, you’ll need to figure out how many people you want in your audience. This will affect the size and type of server you need. It's probably best to start with a smaller number and change it if the radio station becomes more popular. Ten is usually a good start., Once you know how many people you want to broadcast to, you can calculate the amount of bandwidth your radio station requires. High quality mp3 broadcasts require an upload speed of about 192 kilobits per second (kpbs). Multiple this by the number of listeners you expect (or want). This will give you your radio station's required bandwidth.

So, for example, if you want 10 listeners, your bandwidth would be 10 x 192 = 1920 kbps.

, Most home internet connections have a maximum upload speed of around 500 mbps. This means you could really only broadcast to about two people, and you would be using up most of your upload speed on the station. If this is the case, you might want to consider getting a separate server. They cost around $6 per month for an ad-free option.You can also use a free server, but these will give your listeners ads. Some will just show the ads in their web browser instead of interrupting the audio coming from their radio station. Check out FreemStreamHosting.org for one example.

, For your radio station to stream to the external server, you’ll need some information from the host. Make sure you get their IP address or URL, correct port number, stream password, and server type (usually Shoutcast for an external server). You’ll need to plug this information in later., To get your server up and running, you’ll need to edit the configuration menu to make sure that the server broadcasts your audio from the correct files. Open your server app (ShoutCast for an external server or IceCast2 if you're using your home server), and click “Edit Configuration.” Then change some of the information within it. The “sources tag” should list your maximum audience size, the “source-password” should be the password for your stream app (EdCast in this example), and the “hostname” tag should be your IP address. Set the “port” tag to 8000.For the IP address, you’ll either need to enter your own IP address if you’re broadcasting from your home server, or the IP address of your external server. You should get the external server address from your server host, and you can find your own IP address at WhatsmyIP.net

, Once you’re done editing, click save. You should save the server configuration as icecast.xml or shoutcast.xml in the IceCast2 or ShoutCast root directory. When you’re saving, this will come up as C:/ProgramFiles/icecast2 or C:/ProgramFiles/shoutcast., Once you have your server configured, you’ll need to start it up to prepare it for your radio station. Open your server app and click “start server” in the app’s main window., Once you have both Winamp (for playing audio) and Edcast (for turning your audio feed into an open stream), you’ll need the plugin that allows Edcast to use Winamp as its source. Open Winamp, then click on “Options,” then “Preferences,” then “Plugins.” Under “Plugins” select “DSP/Effect” and then choose “edcast DSP v3 ”. Click “configure active plugin” to install the plugin to Winamp., Once you’ve set Winamp to use Edcast as its input source, you’ll need to set Edcast to output to Winamp. Open Edcast and click on the picture of the microphone on the main page. This turns your computer’s microphone off as Edcast's source of sound. If you disable the mic, the Edcast Winamp plugin will make Edcast automatically choose Winamp for its output., Open your Edcast app and click “add encoder.” This allows you to link Edcast to your server settings. Input your server type (Shoutcast if you’re using an external server, IceCast2 if you’re using your own), your server’s IP and the port number and password for the app., Setting the encoder type tells your apps what type of audio files they should broadcast. Usually ACC or MP3 files are the best, because most players can play both of these files. AAC+ files are okay if you are broadcasting at a lower bit rate, but the sound isn’t always great, and not every player can play it., There are very specific rules governing how you can broadcast music. To protect yourself from any sort of lawsuit, you’ll want to get licensed to play music. You can use a licensing server like Live365.com or LoudCity to do this without having to get individual permission from each artist whose music you want to play. These services require that you pay a monthly fee based on your audience size., If you're starting a news/talk radio station rather than a music station, you'll need to create your own audio files instead of just relying on music playlists. Most computers come with some type of audio recording software, which you can use to record the audio you want your listeners to hear., Once you have your server and other apps configured, you’re ready to connect to your audience. Open Edcast’s main window and click “Connect.” This connects your server to your playing app., Open Winamp and begin playing your audio, whether music or talk. With your audio stream app open and connected to your server, you’ll start streaming right away., There’s no point in broadcasting your radio station if no one is listening, so you’ll want to make sure you share the URL of your station. If you have an external server, you’ll get a separate URL from the server host. If you’re using your own server through IceCast2, your radio stream will be http://(youripaddress):(port)/(mountpoint), without parentheses. You can find all of this information in the configuration page of your server app. Share your URL everywhere you can think of – social media, by telling your friends or family in person, or even putting up signs at your favorite places to hang out.If you don’t want to share a URL with your IP address, you can also register your own domain name for free at http://dyn.com/dns/?rdr=dyndnsorg. This will also allow you to choose a website name that tells your audience what they’re listening to.

Understand unlicensed broadcasting.,
Find an available frequency on the radio.,
Find out what type of station your community needs.,
Make a list of necessary equipment.,
Create the mission and vision for your station.,
Fundraise.",How to Start a Low Power FM Radio Station1," Unlicensed broadcasting is legal using a low powered transmitter which was discussed in Part 15 of the FCC’s rules. These devices are limited to 200 feet (61 meter) range. The transmitters are manufactured under the regulation of the FCC and have visible indicators for you to tell.One of the disadvantages of this system is that you have to accept any disturbance from a higher powered radio station.;
, Before you take into account the necessary expenses of a low power FM radio station, you should seek out availability. The FCC allows commercial radio stations to bleed into or overpower your radio station. Search through your local FM stations and find a station without any radio programming.


The key is to find the purest static channel. Make sure there aren’t other voices or sounds lingering in the background.
If there are a couple “clean” stations in a row, then you’re in good shape.
If you live in a metropolitan city like Chicago or L.A., you will have trouble finding a station like this.
You can do a quick check by visiting radiospark.org/rfree for a search of available stations in your area.

, You are a member of a community and feel the need to power a radio station that your community is lacking. Consider if other members of your community want the same type of programming on the airways.A good way to receive feedback is by creating flyers with information about your radio station.


Hang the flyers around town and in community active spots like a coffee shop, library, or a venue space.
If the station becomes popular, it is legal to profit from advertisements.
Say on the flyer, “What do you want to hear on the radio?” in big bold letters, and then explain what your station does.

, It'll help you keep track of what you need by making a quick list of all the equipment you’ll need to power the station. This includes a transmitter, antenna, and basic sound equipment (microphones, mixer, CD player, etc.). Take a quick inventory of media devices you own like a turntable, CD player, cassette player, etc.). Do a basic search online to determine a rough price of the gear you’ll need.

, Mission statements are meant to be a brief write up of your organization. This is an area where you can share the philosophy model you are basing your radio station around. Other items to include are your goals and your performance standards.


These are goals to strive for with a mission statement: to make it memorable, credible, inspirational, and simple.Take a look at some mission statements for nonprofit organizations online.
Here's an example from the station AshevilleFM: ""At AshevilleFM, we're reflecting and adding to the rich stew of arts, culture and community involvement that is Asheville. We're bringing music, news, and the unusual to the airwaves at 103.3FM here in Asheville while having a global reach through our online stream with over 1.7 million hits a month."", Depending on how far you plan to take your station, fundraising in the beginning can benefit your long term goals. Look into some organizations that could be interested in your radio station. Once you find a local organization, draft a letter explaining your fundraising goals and include your mission statement.There are many websites that allow you to make a fundraising pitch online.

"
"
Gather your source equipment.,
Use a reliable computer.,
Get a microphone and audio console.,
Obtain other audio equipment.,
Acquire a Part 15 Transmitter.,
Use a good antenna.",How to Start a Low Power FM Radio Station2," Your source equipment includes a CD player, cassette player, record player, or other form of media players. You aren’t required to have this equipment available, but it will benefit you if you are a music based station.


Consider getting used audio equipment from craigslist or other music posting websites.

, There are many benefits to having a computer for your radio station and studio. You can generate the bulk of your station's broadcast with only a computer playing music, miscellaneous sounds, and even your own voice. Many radio stations record shows on computers and play them at a selected time over the airways.


If you are first starting out, a computer will cut down on a lot of your audio costs.
You can upload your radio show as a podcast or as an internet radio station with a computer.

, Unless you plan to play music alone, you should invest in at least one microphone, if not two. You will also need an audio mixer to switch between multiple audio outputs like a turntable, microphone, and computer. For a good quality microphones invest in a Sennheiser MD 421 or a Shure SH 55.There are options if you don’t want to deal with audio equipment. You can invest in a USB microphone that goes directly into your computer. These mics have been continuing to grow and offer a range in quality.
Consider getting help from a tech-savvy friend if you’re beginning to feel overwhelmed.

, Asides from the microphones and mixing boards, you’ll need cables to attach everything together. Most transmitters take an ⅛” jack (headphone jack), so you’ll need to use the right converters for your mixer. Other cables that might help you are XLR cables (for microphones) and RCA cables (for external audio players).


If you went with the USB microphone, you don’t need to worry about this step.
You’ll also need one or two sets of headphones depending on how many people plan to talk. For future endeavors, you should have two headphones or more. If you use multiple headphones, you will also need a headphone splitter.

, Search through the internet for a professional grade, low powered FM transmitter. There are several options available that are all verified by the FCC. You can spend a small amount of money ($80), or spend a larger sum of around $300.For a cleaner signal, shop for a mono transmitter opposed to a stereo transmitter.
Some transmitters come with an antenna, but these models aren’t as powerful or reliable.

, Remember a good antenna is a must for clear and long transmission. An antenna that works well on one frequency may not work as well on another. Some audio stores will have antennas for FM transmitters, but you will probably have more luck shopping online.


You can also purchase a custom antenna, tuned to your radio frequency. Check out radio brandy for custom antennas: http://www.radiobrandy.com/FMAntenna.html

Prepare a few programs.,
Plug everything in.,
Tune to the station.,
Begin broadcasting.,
Consider the future.",How to Start a Low Power FM Radio Station3," If your station is dedicated to music, prepare music specials. If your station is about science, create some interesting programs related to science. Consider if you want the length of your programs to be 30 minutes or an hour. You could also plan to do a quick 10 minutes of talking every hour of a music show.


Plan for a week of broadcasting and choose certain programs for individual days. Consistency is important for programs to develop a following.
The key to planning programs is that each show is exciting in some way. When in doubt, throw on a catchy playlist.

, Before going live, you should ensure that everything is plugged in and properly connected together. Follow each cable in your system and double check each end to be sure everything is in the proper place. Do a quick test of your broadcast and check the levels on your audio mixer or computer.

, Power your transmitter on and tune to the radio frequency, you choose, that isn't occupied by another station. If you haven’t found a station yet, go through the FM stations using a normal radio. Take note of the channels that don’t have any broadcasting., Have a friend listen to the station in a separate room. You can’t have the radio tuned to your broadcasting station in the room with you. When the microphones are turned on, it can create feedback that will be audible over the radio.


When the microphone is turned off, you can listen to the radio in the same room.

, Build your station up to fit your own means, and eventually you can build it into a legitimate station. It is good to begin broadcasting with a Part 15 transmitter to learn all the mechanics of radio and audio. If you develop a fan base, you can contact local businesses for advertising slots. If you’re a successful station, you can announce an advertisement opening on a popular time slot.The FCC rarely opens applications for licenses for low powered FM stations. If they do anytime soon, you can take the steps to become licensed and upgrade your transmitter to a more powerful device.
Once you begin broadcasting your show, you can also stream your show in a podcast form or even as an internet radio show.

Tie a knot in the antenna wire about 2 feet above the ground, and attach a bungee cord.,
Connect the antenna matching unit, and tune the antenna for the band you would like to operate.

,
Get the kite down.,
Have fun, and be safe.",How to Use a Kite Antenna in Amateur Radio," When planning this project, keep safety in mind as well. First, do not fly kites near power lines, near airports or where there are low-flying aircraft, near busy residential or industrial areas, or anywhere when there is a chance of lightning. Moreover, be sure to ground the antenna wire, as discussed, to avoid shock.;
, For this project, you'll need the following equipment:


Portable HF radio
Power supply (12 v battery) or mains
Lifting kite and line – the kite that you choose is very important, lifting kites usually use just one line and once in the air you have no control over the direction of flight. The type of kite can vary from a small box kite to a large lifting kite.
Antenna wire
Earth rod
RF choke or high value resistor
Antenna matching unit.

, This is the line that provides the security and keeps you kite safely attached to the ground. The line will need to be very strong for lifting kites, and you will need to see advice at the time you purchase your kite. One suggestion is climax Dacron it comes in various different sizes.

, In the United Kingdom it's 60 metres, 200 feet above the ground. In the USA, it is recommended to stay below 500 feet above ground level, as aircraft rarely flow that low but do check local regulations first before assuming this is okay., Taking the UK maximum height of 60m, 200 feet, we need to do some calculations. A kite doesn't fly vertical, so to get a kite 60m or 200 feet into the air you will need to let out, say around 80m, 262 feet of line.


80m, 262 feet of wire, makes for a good antenna on 1.9 mhz or 3.5 mhz. The antenna will also work on 7 mhz but you will require an antenna matching unit.
Look for lightweight but strong wire. Many electronic shops do large reels on single colour wire around 100m per roll ""equipment wire"". Be aware that some insulated wire is more prone to building up static charges than others. For example, kynar insulated wire wrapping wire picks up static very quickly. Surplus antenna wire, which consists of braided copper around a steel core, works much better and does not build up nearly as much static.
Get an earth rod. This is very important as voltages may be induced on the wire you are flying, and these need to be discharged safely to ground. You can pick up an earth rod from a DIY store.
It is recommended that you use of either an RF choke or a high value resistor (100k, for example) from the random wire input to the ground. This should be connected BEFORE launching the kite. Static can build up on the line very rapidly.
You will need some incidentals, such as a hammer to bang in the earth rod, a bungee cord and a couple of climbing style carabiners. The carabiners are used to attach the kite line to the kite, and also to get the kite down at the end of the day.

, As earlier stated, you should not fly your kite close to an airfield or in a busy residential area but this article assumes you have a nice suitable location in mind.


Lay out the kite, and run out the control line to its full extent. Do the following to prepare the kite and antenna for flight:
Beside this, run out the wire antenna. The wire antenna should be a good 5 to 10 meters ( longer than the control wire. Do NOT connect the wire antenna directly to the control line as this can cause the line to fail. The two lines should be separate; it is recommended that you use a small length of rope on the kite before attaching the wire antenna.
Secure the main control line to the ground. You won't be able to hold the kite because these kites pull far too much, so you need to locate a suitable fence or tree. You can use a ground stake, but these are not always strong enough and you won't be able to pull a tree out of the ground... hopefully.
Put the earth rod into the ground. In the first instance, attach the wire antenna to the earth rod.
Use the RF choke or a high value resistor from the random wire input to the ground.
Have the battery and radio and matching unit close to the earth rod.
At this point, you should be ready to go. Check once again that the weather is OK, with no lighting forecast.

, If the wind conditions are OK this should soar into the air taking the antenna wire with it.

, As it's 5 to 10 meters (16.4 to 32.8 feet) longer, it should sag down below the kite line. You can adjust this later.

, You may want to let out a little more kite line to take up the slack in the antenna wire.

, This allows the kite line to jerk in the wind, but dampens the pull on the antenna wire.

,, This can be fun, depending on the strength of wind. Use a carabiner, and walk down the line. You will find the pull on the line is too great to wind the line in, and getting the kite down needs to be completed in a safe and controlled way. The line can be very dangerous if it pulls through your hand, causing burns or worse. The carabiner method keeps your hand and fingers safe, and does not cause wear to the kite lines.

, Flying kites can be dangerous, exercise all precautions to ensure it stays fun and is not endangering anyone. The safety of you and others has to be number one.

Understand CB technology.,
Get a CB Radio.,
Mount your device.,
Select and mount an antenna.",How to Operate a CB Radio1," For many in today’s world of communication, CB radio seems like an outdated method of contact. CB radio still has many benefits depending on how you use the device. For desolate environments, like mountains or deserts, CB radio can be the most effective device to contact people.The radio signal is short wave, so you can only contact those in a 40 to 100 mile radius, depending on the device/antenna you have.
You should probably have a contact you are planning to communicate with using the CB radio.
Another use for CB radio is for safety contacts. If you are going on a long road trip through desolate areas, CB radio can be a vital tool to connect with the police.;
, You can purchase a CB radio from stores like Walmart, other general supplies stores, or online. Consider what you need the radio for to help decide what price you want to spend. If you are using the radio for fun between friends, don’t spend more than $50. If you are setting up a radio communications system for work, spend a little extra for a reliable machine., The most common place to mount a CB radio is in your car. It is important to mount the radio in a location that won’t impinge your safety while driving. A common place to place your radio is underneath the driver’s seat. This ensures that you won’t mess with the radio while driving.Some CB radios come with mounting hardware that will require you to modify your vehicle. Only the larger, older models require you to do this type of installation.
Smaller CBs don’t require any serious installation and can work in the dashboard. Check the mounting instructions before purchasing the CB radio.

, You can get large antennas for a wider range in service, but will require more time to install. There are small profile antennas that are only 2 feet, like the Walcott, which can even be used on motorcycles. The best place to mount your antenna is on the center of your roof.Depending on what antenna you have, you might have to drill holes into your vehicle. Check the installation requirements of the antenna before purchasing it.
If you want an easier installation process, you can invest in a magnetic antenna."

Determine how the product or service will benefit members of the target audience.",How to Write a Radio Ad," Radio ads are recorded and produced into 15, 30, or 60 second segments. When settling on a the length for your ad, you must consider your budget, creative format, and the public's familiarity with your product or service. If you don't have any financial restrictions, you may find it helpful to write a variety 15, 30 and 60 second ads. As you write, read through your ad at a normal pace to make sure you fall within the intended time frame.


If your product or service is well known and/or you have a limited budget, a 15 second ad may suffice.
If your ad is in the form of a creative narrative, you may need 60 seconds tell your tale and sell the product or service.;
, When writing a 15 second radio ad, you only have enough time to share basic information about the product or service. If your target audience is already aware of the product or service, this is an ideal and effective ad length. In this short window of time, you must mention the name of the business/event/individual, the product or service, its cost, and contact information.


The word count of your short radio spot should be between 30 to 40 words., Copywriters do not have to strip down a 30 second ad to basic facts They may include more details in a 30 second ad than in a 15 second ad. This slightly extended time frame allows them to write in a more creative and compelling manner. You could write a dialogue, include testimonials, or even tell a short anecdote.


Your 30 second ad should contain no more than 80 words., The average radio ad lasts for 60 seconds. The one minute slot provides enough time for copywriters to make a complete sales pitch to the intended audience. The writer can grab the listener’s attention, highlight a problem, provide an answer, and guarantee the customer or client’s satisfaction.


A 60 second slot is the ideal length for promoting new products and services.
Your 60 second ad should not contain more than 160 words., This creative format centers around a sole strong voice. This single voice speaks to, not shouts at, the listener, sharing basic information about the service or product. The copy must match this simple format—it should be clear, direct, and focused. When executed properly, it should sound as though this single voice is talking directly to one person.


In addition to sharing basic facts, this straight announcer may pose open ended questions, such as “Do you ever…?” or “Would you like to…?”
This is a great creative format for 15 second ads., People love to listen in on other’s conversations, or dialogs. In this creative format, one character has a problem, which the other character solves by recommending the product or service. The product or service’s benefits are relayed through thoughtfully placed questions and carefully worded answers.


Problem: ”I have a date to the prom, but no suit!” Solution: “I rented my tux from _____. It was fast, easy, and inexpensive.”
Problem: “My child gets so bored in the summer!” Solution: “I heard about this great fine arts camp near our house. They have sessions all summer long.”, A vignette provides listeners a peek into another person’s life. This brief tale allows your listener to identify with the character. Once they see themselves in the add, the hope is that they will seek the same product or service as the individual highlighted in the vignette.Open your ad with a short vignette dramatizing an individual’s specific problem—the goal is to have your listeners identify with the individual in the vignette.

""Oh, no! I've burnt the cake for Harry's birthday to a crisp! What will I do? His surprise party is tonight!""


Once you have established the problem, cut away to an announcer. The announcer will contextualize the problem and offer a solution, i.e. the product or service being advertised. The announcer also provides all of the product or service details.

""Don't let a burnt cake spoil your next party. Surprise your guest of honor with a delicious cake from Manny's Bakery! At Manny's Bakery, we offer a variety of pre-decorated cakes baked fresh for every occasion.""


Time permitting, return to the character from the vignette. Provide a glimpse at how the announcer’s solution solved their problem.

Wow, honey, this cake is delicious!""
""Don't thank me, Harry, thank Manny's Bakery!""


Conclude with a call to action from the announcer.

""Visit Manny's Bakery today!"", Testimonials are reviews of the product or service given by real people. The power of the testimonial is not derived from clever copy but from the person actually providing the testimonial. Real people give the best possible endorsements—these testimonials are raw, honest, believable, and aspirational. There are several forms of testimonials:


Interview random people on the street about a well-established product or service. Ask these individuals why they like the product or service and how it has impacted their daily life.
Ask real people, celebrities, or experts to praise the product or service, while describing its use and benefits., The content of your copy should be inspired and informed by the research you conducted on the product or service. The intended audience will likely have questions that are similar to your research questions. Good copy anticipates these questions—answering them before the customer even has a chance to wonder.


Always write with your audience in mind. Scrutinize each word, phrase, and sentence of the copy to ensure that it will be well received by your target audience.
Provide your audience with a comprehensive understanding of the product or service.
Explicitly state how the product or service will benefit, improve, or fill the need of your customer or client., Radio ads are frequently tuned out by listeners and extremely short. To compensate for these circumstances, copywriters must capture their audience’s attention quickly and write short, precise, and clear copy that holds their listeners’ attention. Achieving this delicate balance is tricky, but possible.


Do not try to share every detail about the product or service in the copy.
Keep your message simple and the focus on the product or service—don’t let the copy get bogged down by an overworked creative format. The product or service should not be overshadowed by a vignette, dialog, or testimonial.
Revise your copy with an editing eye. Consider every word, phrase, and sentence carefully. Could you shorten a sentence from 15 words to 6 words? Is that joke relevant? Is there a better word?Remember that most people who are listening to radio advertisements are driving a car. When the music or show stops, they are apt to change the station. The copy must stop them from changing that station, or get through the other thoughts they have in their head while driving.

, In addition to presenting the product or service in comprehensive and articulate manner, radio ads must also call its listeners to action. In other words, you must explicitly tell the intended audience what it is you want them to do. Call to actions may include telling your listeners to:


Buy the product or try the service
Go to a sale at a specific store
Contact the manufacturer or business
Attend a concert or club
Watch a specific television show, Radio ads rely heavily on sound effects and music to help listeners visualize a scene. When incorporated into the copy correctly, sound effects and music can elevate and transform an ad. As you write the words of the radio ad, simultaneously envision the accompanying sound effects and music.


Sound effects and music should never be an afterthought.
You may also wish to include unusual voices in your ad.For instance, if you are selling a beverage, hearing the bottle open can be enticing. If you are selling season tickets to a baseball team, the crack of the bat and roar of the crowd can grab someone's attention. Rely on these other elements to enhance your ad.

, Before you can write effective, witty, and articulate copy, you need to learn the ins and outs of the service or product you are trying to sell. As you examine the product or service, try to answer to the following questions:


What is the product used for?
What does the service entail?
Who manufacturers the product?
Which company or individual provides the service?
What makes the product or service unique?
How much does the product or service cost?
Is the service or product only offered for a limited time?
How do interested customers contact the seller or service provider?
Where is the product sold?, The tone and content of your radio ad is completely dependent upon your target audience. An ad directed at children and parents will not sound the same as an ad targeting teens and young adults. You might promote a dance club much differently than you would a life insurance policy. When determining the target audience, use the following demographics:


Gender
Race
Ethnicity
Average age
Socio-economic status
Location
Education
Sexual orientation
Relationship status
Job, Advertisement is the art of convincing people that they need a specific product or service. To do this, the radio ad must provide an answer for the following questions:


How will this product or service benefit, improve, or fill the need of your target audience?
Will it solve a specific problem?
Will it provide them with entertainment?
Will it make them trendy and cool?
Will it save them time and/or money?
Will it provide them with information and valuable skills?
Will it help them to get ahead at work, home, or school?
Will it allow them to meet new people?"

Wait for a response. If no one responds, re-issue a radio check, but wait patiently before doing so. When another operator responds, interpret their response.


Many operators are truck drivers who aren't looking for conversation. Others are enthusiasts that can not wait to chat. Follow the tone of the other person/people.
Be polite. Nobody wants to communicate with a rude operator. Also be sure not to take up too much air time while on a crowded station., Plan to use the CB radio with your friends by picking a station to use. Once you are apart, send out a radio check and wait for a response. Say something simple like, “This Wendy at the old lodge, over.” Wait a couple moments before sending out the signal again.


Once your contact responds, you can use the CB to chat. Do not use a crowded station for small talk.

, Channel 9 is immediately reported to highway patrol, police, and rescue services in the area. Use this station to relay any distress message such as suspicious activity or vehicle failure.

",How to Make an Oldies Style Radio Program," Is this a western? A spy story? What is the name of the main character? Where did he/she come from? Back stories are useful in TV, comics, radio- anything that is serialized, because they make a good first episode, and can be referenced later on to fill out a short-ish episode.;
, Does your lead have a romantic interest? How about a sidekick? Is there a main antagonist? You should probably come up with back stories for these too; even if you never reference them, they'll help with your characterization.

, Based on the premise and the characters, what do you imagine them doing? You could briefly tell the backstory of you main character, or write about how they met the main antagonist, etc. Remember that you are introducing the characters for the first time; a listener can't read your mind. This should be done before you choose any actors for two reasons:


You can get people interested in acting for you by showing them the script.
You may lose the interest of your actors while they wait for something to act in.

, Tell them a little about the premise and all of the available characters.

, Have people read from the script. Think about who the characters are, and which of your friends sound most like them. Remember: This is audio only. You are not casting based on looks.

,, Actors who aren't in the scene should provide sound effects, like slamming doors, applause, crowd noises, gunshots, etc. The only exception is footsteps; actors should do this for their own characters. (Dropping a heavy book on a tabletop makes a good gunshot.)

, An example of this would be bird sounds or crowd chatter.

, Actual radio is a little un-realistic, although you can always send a tape to a station if you want. You could also set up an internet radio station- I think there's an wikihow article on how to do that.

Wear your seat belt.,
Drive a safe car which is fitted with seat belts and other safety features.,
Store objects such that they will not hit you if the car gets hit.,
Make sure the safety systems on your car are serviced regularly.,
Do not lean against the dashboard.,
Make sure your car's engine, brakes, transmissions, suspension and tires are in good condition.",How to Survive a Car Accident1," Wearing your seatbelt is one of the most important things you can do to survive a car crash. Make sure that your lap belt sits low on your hip bones and that the shoulder belt goes across the center of your chest. Children should be seated in proper child restraints until they are large enough to properly wear a lap and shoulder belt.;
, You won't have to worry about head support unless you are driving a really old car from the 1980s or under. Older cars, which may just have lap belts and almost never have any additional safety features, are generally less safe than large vehicles. SUVs tend to be more prone to rollover accidents than cars. Try to drive the safest car that suits your needs and budget. The Insurance Institute for highway safety maintains extensive crash test ratings and lists of safe vehicles of different sizes and styles.In Europe, Euro NCAP maintain these ratings. Their website is at: http://euroncap.com

, If an object could become a projectile during a crash, either remove it from the car, or stow it in the trunk, or, in the case of a minivan, in the well behind the seat.

, Airbags and seat-belts significantly reduce injury and death in automobile accidents.

, If there is a high-speed crash, the car's airbags inflate. They have saved lives, but they inflate with such force that if you are leaning against the dashboard when they inflate you will be thrown backwards and injured. If the car has curtain airbags (also called side airbags) it is also dangerous to lean against the sides of the car.

, The safest accident is the one you don't get in; having your car in top running condition can help you avoid an accident or minimize harm in case you get in an accident.

Obey traffic laws and be conscious of current conditions.,
Focus on what you are doing.,
Anticipate potential problems.",How to Survive a Car Accident2," Adjust your driving if in heavy traffic or inclement weather. Sixty mph may be safe when it's dry, but if a sudden rain falls, wetting the roadway and raising oil off the ground, it will probably be safer to drive at a lower speed.

, While driving, avoid using cell phones, reading maps, eating and other distracting activities. If you are a passenger, sit up straight with your seat-belt fastened. Don't lean your seat too far back, don't put your feet up on the dashboard, and definitely do not distract the driver. Do not place objects on top of the airbag enclosure.

, Observe the road looking for things that could end up causing an accident.


Look ahead for cars or pedestrians that may move into your car's path.
Keeping a safe distance behind other vehicles (following the ""two second rule"" ) can help you have enough time to react when a vehicle in front of you makes an unexpected move.
Stay away from distracted drivers (e.g., the guy on his way to work using an electric razor), tailgaters and other drivers engaging in risky behaviors.
Keep an eye on parked cars. They may pull out in front of you; people may exit from them or move from between them without much warning.

Stay calm.,
Choose your course of action.,
Brake with control.,
Steer smoothly.,
Accelerate if needed.,
Take steps to recover if you start to skid or lose control.,
If a crash is unavoidable, try to minimize damage.,
After a crash, switch off your engine, do not smoke, and stop anyone else from smoking.,
Call emergency services after a crash.",How to Survive a Car Accident3," If an accident appears imminent, you need to respond quickly but smoothly. Vehicles of all types respond better to smooth steering and braking inputs.

, You need to decide what combination of steering, braking and accelerating will best serve to avoid or minimize the harm from an accident.

, Braking practices vary depending upon whether your vehicle has anti-lock brakes.


No anti-lock brakes - If your car lack anti-lock brakes, you need to pump the brakes to keep the car under control. If you slam on the brakes, your car will start to skid and you will lose control. You cannot steer a vehicle when the brakes are locked. Press firmly, then release. If you feel the tires start to skid release the brakes before steering.
Anti-lock brakes - Do not pump anti-lock brakes. Your car's ABS computer will pulse them much faster than you can (you will feel the pedal vibrate a bit when this occurs). Just hold the brakes firmly and steer normally.

, - Very jerky motions of the steering wheel, especially with heavy vehicles or those with light rear ends (e.g., pickup trucks) are likely to lead to skids.

, Although it seems counter-intuitive, sometimes the best way to avoid an accident is to speed up and get out of the way.

, If your car starts to skid or if a tire blows, follow these steps to control the car.


Don't hit the brakes. This will only make things worse.
Keep a firm grip on the wheel.
Steer in the direction of the skid. If the back of your car is sliding to the driver's left, turn the wheels to the left.
Wait for your tires to regain traction before braking or pressing the accelerator.

,

Avoid head-on collisions into other vehicles or front-end collisions into immovable objects like large trees or concrete barriers.
Do as much as you can to control your car's speed. The faster the impact, the more damage it will cause.
Avoid side impacts. Serious injury is likely to result if another car strikes your car on the side where it is much weaker structurally and closer to the driver.

, This especially important if one of the vehicles involved in the crash was carrying dangerous goods (e.g. flammable goods such as paraffin or aerosols, or explosive goods), as in such crashes it is important to prevent explosions or fires, as much as you are not in a film and in reality cars can only really explode or catch fire after crashes if the crash involved a vehicle carrying dangerous goods.

, Apply first aid if needed. Do not attempt to removed injured people from a vehicle yourself. Explosions are very unlikely, and you could aggravate any neck spinal injuries, even if the victim feels uninjured. Leave removal of injured people to the emergency services.

Protect your parked car from heat.,
Protect the upholstery and dashboard with products.,
Consider getting tinted windows.,
Park in the shade.,
Check the car's battery.,
Keep an eye on the coolant.,
Travel when it's cooler.",How to Protect Your Car in Hot Weather," Car upholstery, dashboards and steering wheels can suffer from too much sunlight and heat beaming down on them regularly. If you have to park in the sunshine during summer on a daily basis, do what you can do protect the inside part of the car. Some of the things you can do include:


Use a windshield sun shade. This is usually something that folds out and then folds up easily for storing behind the seat. If you put up a shade every time you use the car, it'll help cut the sun's rays and can reduce a bit of the heat. While you can use just one for the front, a back window shade can also be helpful for some car types.;
, There are products available that can provide an additional protective layer, such as vinyl or leather protectants.

, If you leave the car parked in the sun a lot and it causes cracking of the upholstery, etc., tinting may be an option. However, you'll need to check your local regulations as some jurisdictions don't allow tinted windows for safety or other reasons.

, Wherever possible, find shady or indoor car parking during the hottest parts of the day. In some places this is possible if there are car parks lined along a park or in leafy neighborhoods. Obviously, many places lack trees for shade but check out building shade––try to look for streets where the shade created by buildings will be passing over your car during the hottest part of the day.

, Excessive fluid evaporation can reduce the life of the battery. If it's the type of battery that needs liquid top-ups, add distilled water when needed.

, This should be topped up when needed. Of course, don't open the radiator cap when the car is still running hot; wait at least an hour after using the car before opening.

, Try to target your driving times for the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening. This will make it a lot more pleasant for both the driver and any passengers.

Park against a full curb in back or front of the vehicle, if possible.,
Turn your wheels to the side as much as possible.,
Set your parking or emergency brake as hard as you can.,
Utilize the 'club' or some steering wheel locking device.

,
If you have a 4-Wheel-Drive system on your vehicle, select the 4-HI setting, or if you really want to take the extra time and make it as absolutely difficult as possible, enable the 4-LO mode.,
You can also park between two cars, one in front of you and one in back of you.,You can use wheel lock to make it immobilized.",How to Make Your Car Hard to Be Towed," This makes one less side that can be accessed to tow your vehicle.;
, This makes it nearly impossible to tow your vehicle from the back end unless it is put on a flat bed tow truck. In this case, it will at least make it more difficult to get onto the bed of the tow truck.

, While this doesn't keep your vehicle from being towed, it will make it more difficult.

,, By enabling the 4-wheel-drive system (automatic 4-wheel-drive doesn't count, you have to select a full-time mode), the drivetrain is all locked together, and requires all four wheels to move together. By selecting 4-LO, the low gearing will undoubtedly hold the vehicle where you parked it. Don't forget to disable 4WD when you decide to leave, otherwise damage may occur to the drivetrain when operating 4WD on pavement.

, This makes it almost impossible for your vehicle to be towed.

Determine the focus of your advertisement.,

Set up studio time.,
Edit the ad.,
Purchase airtime.",How to Make a Commercial for Radio,"


Choose 1 or 2 related products to relay in your commercial. For example, if you are a furniture store, focus on the quality or affordability of your mattresses. The more specific your ad, the more likely listeners will recall it when they think of that product.;
,


Throw out 5, 10 or even 15 different ideas with your advertising department. If you do not have a business with such a department, gather your top employees or a few friends and go through ad concepts. Creativity can be somewhat limited on a radio platform, but that doesn't mean you can't have original ideas.

,


Begin with an attention-grabbing statement. It's crucial to stand out as quickly as possible in radio advertising. If a listener is not interested, he or she will most likely immediately switch the station to one without an ad.






Couple the emotional with the logical. A straightforward ad with only facts won't appeal to many listeners. Creating a mix of emotional factors and logical requests is the most effective way to draw listeners. For example, a half-off sale on smart phones is a great deal logically, but it could be more effective if the advertisement detailed how important it is to have a smart phone to share photos with your grandmother.






Leave the ad sparse. Do not over-complicate your commercial time. Overwhelming the listener is an almost sure way to make them tune out.






Make a great offer. You can create a great radio ad, but if you don't have a good deal, no one is going to be called to action. Make a compelling offer that causes listeners to consider your product.






Include the answer to ""What's in it for me?"" Listeners want to know why they should try your product. If they don't receive an answer, they will move on. Have an answer that solves people's problems.







,


Hire or solicit the services of a friend with a radio voice. Radio voices tend to have lower tones and can be described as rich and full. Some radio commercials use voice-over artists with high-pitched, loud voices in order to garner the most attention. It depends on the type of advertisement you are making whether you should hire a soothing radio voice or an irritating one.







,


Record your commercial in a rented studio for the best possible production value. Production value can be very important on the radio because sound is the only sense witnessed. If the voice pops or is muffled, no one will hear the ad and you might lose money.







,


Cut it down to your allotted time. Broadcast stations are usually not very lenient on time. If you have a 60-second commercial slot, your commercial should be 60 seconds long.
Add sound elements to enhance the scene.

When parking the vehicle, make sure that it is in a legal parking zone, to guard against thieves who impersonate council askaris (traffic wardens) to steal vehicles by towing.;
, Many vehicle thefts start as crimes of opportunity to steal valuables inside the car; such as car stereos, laptops or any visible cash or jewelry. By keeping this things safely hidden away you can prevent many would-be thieves from even taking a second look at your car.

, While parking the car facing your gate makes it easy for you to drive out in the morning, it also makes it easy for thieves to escape with the vehicle. Forcing the thief to reverse the car out if they are trying to steal it, makes it a bit harder for them and can give you those extra precious minutes to alert for help.

, A nice loud honk of your horn can intimidate would be carjackers and bright lights can also attract attention to others thus reducing the attractiveness of stealing your car. Regular check-ups to your garage can make sure that these remain in good working order.

, Sometimes despite your best efforts your vehicle will still get stolen. The panic that usually follows a car theft is accompanied by regrets of things you could have done to prevent it. By installing the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) device from suppliers such as Carzone you will never have any regrets.

The more effort, and the more risk, the less chance that anything will happen to your vehicle;
,  This may seem like a no-brainer, but thieves are less likely to break into a vehicle that has an alarm, as they want as little attention

,  This also seems like a no-brainer, but people leave things in their vehicles all the time, remember: No Profit, No Crime.  To clarify, this DOES NOT mean ""let's just put everything in the trunk"" as most trunks are very easily accessible

,  This means that you should always leave your centre console, glove compartment, and any other ""cubby holes"" open, so that when a thief looks into your vehicle, they will see that there is nothing worth taking, and they will move on to the next vehicle

,  Try to figure out how the vehicle was broken into (eg. Window taken off the frame, pry marks on the window frame, or a completely smashed window).  Call the company that owns the lot that you are parked in and report the incident.

If you do not have the operator's manual, check inside the car to look for automatic lock buttons. Cars that do not have internal automatic locks probably don't have external automatic locks, either.
You can also check the car key to determine whether or not the car has automatic locks. Vehicles equipped with such locks usually have keys with lock buttons on them, but if your car key does not have any buttons on it, you probably won't be able to lock and unlock the car automatically from the outside.;
, When you get into the car, you can usually lock all of the doors manually.


Manual locks can be located at the base of the window frame or on the side of the door, near the handle. Switching the lock to the ""down"" position usually locks it, while flipping it ""up"" typically unlocks it.
When using manual locks, you will likely need to lock all doors separately.

, Cars equipped with automatic locks have an automatic lock button near the handle of the door and/or in the center console.


These buttons are typically labeled with the image of a traditional lock. Pressing the button down toward the closed lock image will lock the car, but pulling the button up toward the open lock image will unlock the car.
In most cases, pressing the automatic lock button from any point in the car will lock all of the vehicle's doors.

, As long as the car door has a manual lock on the handle, you should be able to manually lock it from the outside.


Most cars only have locks on the two front doors (driver side and passenger side). Some may only have a lock on the front driver side door.
Insert the key into the keyhole and turn it toward the trunk. Doing so should lock the car. Turning it toward the hood should unlock the car.
Note that in some cars, the car lock might be reversed. If turning toward the trunk does not lock the door, try turning it toward the front of the car.

, To lock automatic locks from the outside, you'll usually need to use the lock button on the key.


In most cases, the lock button will be clearly identified by a closed lock icon.
Most keys also have a separate unlock button marked by an open lock icon.

, In some cases, the automatic locks can be operated with a wireless key fob instead of an actual key.


Key fob remotes are built into keychains. There might be a ""lock"" icon on the keychain you can use to lock the car, but this isn't always the case.
Sometimes, you will need to keep the key fob nearby while standing directly next to the vehicle. There should be an unmarked button on the car handle. Press the button once to unlock the vehicle and twice to lock it. This will only work if the key fob is within a certain distance of the vehicle itself, however, and this distance can vary by manufacturer and model.

, Locking your car limits access. As a result, potential car thieves will have a harder time breaking into it, making it a less appealing target for theft.


On average, roughly half of the cars stolen in combined urban, suburban, and rural areas were left unlocked at the time of the theft.In addition to locking your car, you should also take extra precautions to discourage potential thieves from targeting your vehicle. Most thieves will opt for an easy target over a hard one, so the less accessible your car is, the less likely it is to be stolen.

, Keeping the car locked while you're inside the vehicle can help prevent kidnappings and carjackings.Anyone with a weapon can target you while you're in the car. If a potential threat approaches the car without you noticing, you stand a better chance of noticing in time and driving away unharmed if the criminal is delayed by a locked door.
You can also protect yourself from kidnappings and carjackings by traveling on well-lit, busy roads, especially when it's dark outside. Be as aware of your surroundings as possible and keep the car in gear at stop signs and traffic lights so that you can drive away from potential threats quicker.

, Keep the windows completely rolled up. In many cases, open windows make it possible for thieves to unlock the door.You shouldn't even leave the window cracked on a hot day. Depending on the design of the car, it might be possible for a thief to grab onto the lock with a hook or wire and open the car that way.

, Regardless of whether you lock the car or not, you should remove all sets of car keys from the vehicle and take them with you.


Approximately 13 percent of stolen vehicles have keys at them at the time of the crime.
If you do leave a second set of keys in the car, you should hide them in an unusual and hard-to-reach spot. Professional car thieves know just about all of the possible hiding places, however, so it is still better to remove the keys completely than it is to hide them.

, If your car comes equipped with an alarm, set the alarm every time you leave the vehicle.


Even if your car is equipped with an alarm from the manufacturer, it can be a good idea to install a secondary alarm, as well. More layers of security are better than fewer. Opt for an alarm that activates sirens, horns, and lights for maximum coverage.

, If potential thieves know your car's key code, they might be able to make a copy of that key without the key itself. Remove visible signs of the key code from your keys to prevent this from happening.


Some keys have the number stamped directly on the key, in which case, you should cover it with a sticker or something similar. In other cases, the key code will be on a separate sticker, decal, or tag that can be completely removed from the key., Park your car in a garage when possible, especially when parking at home. If you need to park your car in an open lot, choose the best possible location for it.


It is much more difficult for thieves to break into both a garage and a car, so using your home garage is strongly recommended. Make sure that both the garage and car are locked to provide maximum security.
When parking in an open lot, choose a well-lit area and a crowded lot. Avoid parking in between large vehicles that hide your car, too. More people and improved visibility will both deter potential thieves.
When possible, you should also park close to your destination for the sake of your own safety.

, Nowadays, some advanced thieves may attempt to steal your vehicle by towing it away. There are some things you can do to make your car tougher to tow, however.


Turn the tires toward the curb when parallel parking. When parking in a driveway or parking lot, turn the tires as far to one side as possible.
Back into your driveway if your car is equipped with rear-wheel drive. The rear wheels will lock, making it harder to tow. Cars that only have front-wheel drive should be parked front-end forward.
Use the emergency brake when you park your car, as well.

, Ideally, you should only run the car when you're actually inside it. Never leave your car with the key still in the ignition, even if you only need to leave for a minute or so.


Plenty of cars are stolen at ATMs, gas stations, and other similar locations when their owners leave the engine running.
Similarly, some cars are stolen from driveways, streets, and parking lots when their owners leave the vehicle running to warm it up on a cold day.

, At minimum, you should carry the vehicle's registration with you in your purse or wallet instead of keeping it in the car.


Keeping the registration in your car can make it easier for a thief to sell it, and it also has your home address on it, giving the thief knowledge of where you live. For the same reasons, you should also keep the title filed away in your house.
You should also know your car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), which will make the car easier to identify if it does get stolen. Etch the VIN into all windows and take plenty of pictures of your car with the plate number visible to show police.
Another way you can make it easier for police to identify your car is to place identification markers, like dye markers and engravings, around multiple places, including tailgates, spoilers, and under the hood.

, It's best to remove valuables from your car, but if you need to keep something of value in your vehicle temporarily, make sure that it is hidden out of sight.


While valuables don't make your car easier to break into, they can make the car seem more tempting.
Do not hide your valuables under a blanket or jacket since this can still seem obvious to many thieves. Don't keep them in your glove compartment or center console, either, since most thieves will think to look there. If you need to leave a valuable in your car, the best place for it is usually the trunk.
While you may not necessarily think of it as a ""valuable,"" you should also remove your garage door remote since it can provide thieves with access to your home.

Find a suitable area.,
Gather materials.,
Properly Wash and Clean the surface.,
Surface MUST be dry.After cleaning the area, dry it with a cloth of your choice.,
Prepare the area.,
Shake the can.,
Paint in sections.Painting in sections will allow for the fastest time(6-8 hours) through this process.,
Spray the first layer.It is very important that this layer is a light dusting because the first layer is the bonding layer meaning it will be a 50 -60% transparency.,
Spray additional layers.Increasing the layers on top of the first will only increase the durability of the plasti dip.,
Tape/newspaper removal.After the final layer is applied, immediately remove any painter's Tape or newspaper that may have been used, from the immediate area, and toss them in the trash.,
Cure time.,
Spray car accessories.For car accessories such as emblems and the grille, repeat steps 1 - 11.,
Plasti dip rims.The cleanest way to apply plasti dip your rims is to remove the wheels completely from the car.",How to Plasti Dip Your Car and Car Accessories," Find an area that is large enough to house the car and is extremely ventilated. A good suggested area would be an open garage, but if that is not possible, outside under the shade is a good area. Avoid direct sunlight.;
, Gather the materials needed listed in the Things you’ll need section.

, Before applying any type of plasti dip to the car, it must be clean. The plasti dip is an overlay so it will form a separate layer on top of any surface as well as dirt, raised surfaces, or bird poop found on the car. In other words, you want a clean surface to work with.

, Personally I use Meguiar's Water Magnet Drying Towel, but you can use any terry towel. Avoid using shirts with designs or logos and paper towels.These will create scratches.

, Although plasti dip is already easy to remove, you would want to prepare the area. Preparing the area you wish to apply the plasti dip reduces the hassle of removing the over spray later. Using painters tape and newspapers, cover windows and any designated area that you do not want to get plasti dip on.

, As with any spray-on material, it will need vigorous shaking. Shake the can for 1 minute.

, For example, add a first layer to the hood, while the hood is drying add a first layer to the roof, etc. You do not need to start on the hood. You may start wherever you like.- important note! do not touch Plasti dip on car at any point in time during the process as to avoid any mis-painted spots. Plasti dip is safe to touch after curing. It is recommended to wear a mask and eye protection.

, This will allow the rest of the layers to bond and stick to the paint. Spray in a clean sweeping motion, making sure to hold the can 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away from the area. Allow plasti dip to dry 15-30 minutes depending on climate, before adding the next layer

, The average amount of layers is 4-5. Any additional amount of layers is up to personal satisfaction. The layers after the first will be light  layers in which you will fully coat the area. Spray in a clean sweeping motion, making sure to hold the can 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away from the area. Remember Allow 15-30 minutes of drying time in between each layer.

, Remove before plasti dip dries.

, At this point the plasti dip will take 4 hours to fully cure. At ALL costs, avoid any form of liquid, or any substance that may cause damage to the area. It may ruin the curing process.

, Spray onto emblems or grille only.    - important note! if the car is currently in the curing process, wait until car is fully cured before preparing the area. Spraying the car accessories can be done while painting the main body of the car.

, Follow respective car manual on how to remove entire wheel from car. Repeat steps 1-11 for the rims. It is completely optional to cover the rubber of the wheel as plasti dip is easily removable. But covering the rubber ensures easy clean up. (Wranglerforum.com)

Straighten out the hanger.,
Bend the hook into a “V” shape.,
Pry the window out slightly if it is closed.,
Slide the hanger into the gap.,
Catch the post and pull up and toward the back of the car.,
Press the unlock button if you can reach it.",How to Use a Coat Hanger to Break Into a Car1," Stretch out the wire so that it is long enough to reach the unlock button or the post. Untwist the hooked portion, then straighten it completely, leaving only the curved end in its original shape. To unwind the part of the wire hanger that is twisted around itself, it helps to use a pair of pliers. The coat hanger should be shaped like a relatively straight line with a curved hook on the end when you’re done.You may want to wear gloves while untwisting the hanger to avoid poking yourself in the hand.
Using pliers will make untwisting the hanger easier.;
, You will need to bend the hook of the coat hanger down into a shape that can grip the door lock post. A small “V” or check mark shape will be the easiest shape to fit through a small gap that can also do the job. Use a pair of pliers to fold the end of the straightened coat hanger until the span of the check mark is tight enough to hook the post.Many door lock posts have a groove or ridge that will make it easier to grip when using a coat hanger for this purpose.
You may need to bend the hanger into a few different sized check marks or “V” shapes until you have one that will grip the post.

, If the window is open slightly, you will not need to pry it out at all. However, if the window is shut, you will need to slide a narrow wedge into the gap between the window and door frame and pry the window out away from the vehicle. Be extremely careful doing this, as applying too much pressure will break the window.A wider prying surface such as a paint scraper is a better choice than something narrow like a screw driver.
Once pried open, place something like a folded up piece of cloth or rubber into the gap to hold it open.

, Grip the end of the coat hanger that is opposite from the “V” shape you made with pliers. Slip the hanger into the gap you created between the window and door frame. If the lock post is too close to the rear side of the car door, you may need to approach it from the front instead. It is important that you get to the post in a direction that allows you to apply pressure to it as you pull it up.
Be careful not to put additional pressure on the window as it’s pried open or you may break it.

, Wiggle the hanger around until you catch the post, then apply pressure by pulling the hanger back toward the rear of the car. If the lock is too close to the rear side of the window, try applying pressure forward as you pull it up. Continue to apply pressure as you pull the post up to unlock the door.If the post pops up, the door will be unlocked and you can open it.
You may need to try multiple times if the hanger slips off of the post.

, Snake the bent coat hanger through the window crack and hit the unlock button with the tip of the wire. Be patient. This may take a number of tries, depending on the size of the window crack and the layout of your particular car.If you're having trouble hitting the unlock button with the tip of the coat hanger, try adding a small bit of rubber to the end.
Wrap a small rubber band around the tip, for friction, or impale an eraser on the wire. This might help you get a better handle on the button surface.

"
Straighten out the hanger and bend it again as necessary.,
Bend the hook into a short hook or ledge to push or pull the slide.,
Slide the hanger between the door and door frame.,
Have a friend guide you from the passenger side.,
Press or pull on the slide to unlock the door.",How to Use a Coat Hanger to Break Into a Car2," In order to reach the lock slider for push or pull locks, you will need to straighten the hanger out, then bend it again in the right manner to reach the it. Depending on your vehicle, this may require a number of bends or few at all.You may need to guess and check the proper bends in the coat hanger a few times in order to get it right.
Try not to bend the hanger too far, as bends will reduce its ability to press or pull directly on the slider.

, If you need to pull the slider to unlock it in your vehicle, you will want to bend the end of the hanger into a hook that can snag the ledge on it. If you need to push it, it’s more important that you bend the tip in such a manner that can put the force necessary on the slider to push it over.Use a pair of pliers to make a small, strong hook or ledge.
If you are sliding the hanger in the gap in the door frame instead of a window gap, it will need to be very thin.

, If you are unable to pry the window away from the door frame, you will need to instead slide the hanger through the very narrow gap between the door itself and the frame. The door and door frame are separated by a thin layer of weather proofing that you may damage in the process. Press the hanger through the weather proof layer and into the car.Some vehicles will not permit the hanger to pass through because of the angle. You will then have to find a way to pry the window away from the door.
If you tear the weather proofing, you will need to replace it or the door may leak.

, Once the tip of the hanger is inside the cabin of the car, you may not be able to see the slide for the door lock from your position. Ask a friend to stand on the passenger side of the car and guide you by looking through the window.You can still find the lock without a second pair of eyes, but enlisting some help will make the process far easier.
Be patient and continue trying until you are able to snag or press the slide.

, Once you get the hanger on the slide, push or pull it as necessary to unlock the door. This may take a number of tries and you also may need to make changes to the bends in the coat hanger in order to get to the slide from the right angle.Be patient and continue trying until you are able to snag or press the slide.
Be careful not to do further damage to the weather proofing as you move the hanger around.

Straighten the hanger except for a short hook at the end.,
Slip the hanger between the window and the weather stripping.,
Turn the hanger so the hook is facing the interior.,
Move the hanger side to side until you see the lock move.,
Pull up or back on the area that moves the lock.,
Keep trying and reform the hook as needed.",How to Use a Coat Hanger to Break Into a Car3," Just as with other methods, you will need to unfold the hanger and straighten it, except for the end. Use a pair of pliers to form a short hook at the end of the hanger. Leave only a half inch or so as the lip of the hook, while leaving the rest of the hanger straight.You may need to bend the hook a few times in order to get it right.
Make sure the rest of the hanger is a fairly straight line.

, There should be a length of black rubber weather stripping running along the lower edge of your car window. Peel this strip back from the window a bit using your finger, then gently insert the curved end of the coat hanger into the gap between the window and the rubber. You should be able to lower the coat hanger into this gap a few inches without encountering much resistance.You may have to replace the weather stripping if you damage it during this process.
It may be easier to insert the hanger with the hook facing the front or rear of the vehicle.

, With the hanger and hook inserted in the door, rotate it until you believe the hook is facing the inside of the car so it can catch the lock bar inside the door. It may be difficult to determine which way the hook is facing inside the door; you can mark one side of the hanger with a marker to make it easier to keep your bearings.The hook will need to face inward in order to grip the lock bar.
You may need to try a number of times in order to get this method right.

, As you move the hanger back and forth, it will come into contact with a bar or pin that controls the lock post and door lock. Try to pull up on the pin or bar to disengage the door lock. It will usually be located about 2 inches (5 cm) below the bottom of the window, near the interior door handle. Different vehicles may have different interior door designs, so this method may not work on all vehicles.
Do not use excessive force when pulling up on the pin or bar. Because you can’t see inside the door, you may be snagged on the wrong thing.
In some vehicles you will need to pull the pin or bar back toward the rear of the car instead of up.

, If you see the lock move slightly when your hook catches a bar or pin inside the door, try to pull up or backward on the bar you’ve come into contact with to disengage the lock. If you catch the bar properly, it should not take too much force to move the lock.Pulling up and toward the rear of the car can help ensure you have leverage on the bar or pin as well as improving the odds that you get it right for your specific vehicle.

, This method is extremely difficult, as you can’t actually see what is going on inside the door and vehicles each have slightly different designs. You will need to continue to try until you are able to catch the bar in just the right manner and pull it with enough force to unlock the door.Be careful not to damage the weather strip on the door.
You may need to re-bend the hook if you pull too hard on the wrong part inside the door.

Choose damping materials in which you plan to dampen your car with such as mats, foams, sprays, or insulation; it is recommended to use a combination of these products in order to achieve maximum damping.,
Add weight to panels using damping mats.,
Place the damping mats between 2 of the door panels that are in close proximity to each other, to help reduced the vibrations within the space between the 2 door panels.

,
Place the damping mats inside an engine compartment to reduced rattling noises.",How to Sound Deaden Your Car1," Theses damping materials absorb sound waves, eliminate resonance, and diminish vibrations.


Damping mats: These are simple to install damping materials and are used to cover panels in your car to help with sound deadening. They are typically made of either stryene-butyadine rubber or asphaltic panes with adhesive backing and either lower the resonant frequency of the panel, or transform the sound vibrations into heat depending on the damping material used in your particular mats.
Sprays: These come in either professional cans requiring compressors and paint guns for application or easy to use aerosol cans. Sprays are used in situations where matting would be too bulky to fit or the weight of the matting would be too heavy such as door panels or kick panels.
Foams: Foams come in either sheet or spray form. The foam sheets are used just as the damping mats are by laying them over car panels to absorb vibration. Instead of converting the vibrations to heat, as the mats do, the foam sheets dispersing the energy throughout the sheet.
Insulation: This damping material is a thick pane of fibers that absorb sound and is laid underneath the carpet. The most typical type of insulation is jute or micro jute. Although insulation is less effective in regard to sound deadening, is does add thermal insulation to the interior of your car as well as creates a plusher carpet

, This will help with the panel's tendency to vibrate causing unwanted noise.

,, The mats contain metal foil backing in order to increase the mat's heat resistance making them able to be near the heat of the engine. Apply them using a contact adhesion glue found at your local auto shop.

"
"
Fill small spaces using the sprays or foam spray.",How to Sound Deaden Your Car2," These damping materials expand as they cure, allowing them to push against nearby panels creating a sound deadening joint that absorbs and disperses the vibrating energy. Sprays and foams can be used around doors and engines spaces, but be sure to check the label of your specific spray or foam to verify.;
"
"
Measure the door panels and carpeted areas along the floor you will apply the damping materials of your choice to.

,
Slice the insulation and/ or matting according to the measurements of the area you plan to place the damping materials.,
Paint or spray contact adhesion glue to the body of the car in which you plan to place the damping mats and insulation.

,
Place the damping materials on top of the glue, pressing firmly to assure adhesion.

,
Spray any foam and spray sound deadening materials in each crevice as necessary.

,
Allow glue and sprays to cure, or dry, in accordance with the directions on each material.

",How to Sound Deaden Your Car3,", If installing insulation, be sure to pull the carpeting from the body of the car before proceeding to the next step.

"
Begin by cleaning the car to remove any dust or potential obstacles for the sander.,
Fill or repair any visible dents or deep scratches now - make sure you get a good adhesion if using a filler by cleaning inside the dent, chip or scratch and creating a rough surface with an abrasive.

,
Attach a coarse abrasive disc to your sanding machine - such as P60 grade - for initial sanding.,
Once reaching the primer, switch to a finer grade to remove the scratches made by the coarse disc.,
Aim for a matte finish, not a high polish - a high polish will not provide enough 'grip' for the primer and new paint.",How to Sand a Car for Repainting," Remove any loose fixtures and any detailing (badges, wing mirrors and headlight surrounds) that can be removed. Mask everything else with abrasion resistant or masking film.;
,, Use a smooth motion, not stopping or moving too quickly, to remove the outermost layer of paint. If you find the coarse attachment cutting too hard, switch to a lower grade, but make sure the entire surface has been cut to the same level.

, Continue to remove as much of the primer as possible, ideally reaching bare metal. There should be no visible scratches at this stage.

, That said, there should be no visible marks or scratches left by the final sanding phase.

Look if there is already a luxury sibling of your car.,
Wrap your steering wheel with leather.,
Replace and cover all the plastic.,
Replace the carpet.,
Change your cover seat.,
Replace your wheel with alloy.,
Be subtle.,
Replacing the grill may be a good idea.,
Replace your car stereo with a double din GPS touchscreen.,
Keep your car up to date with the maintenance.",How to Transform Any Car Into a Luxury Car," Chances are that if you own a car, that there may be another one with luxury features. Get to test drive the luxury version of the car and compare it with yours. You will notice the subtle changes that the manufacture has applied.;
, If there is something that makes a car feel great is a thick and soft leather steering wheel. There are 3 options to accomplished this. The first one, is to buy a kit online. It usually is made with ""PV Leather"" but it comes with everything you will need to do the job (a leather strap with saw patterns in both sides, a thin foam to put between the leather and the wheel, a string and a needle) This option cost around $5 to $10 on ebay .The second option is for you to buy the leather, cut a strips of around 2 and half inches by the diameter of your wheel, saw 2 lines in the side (you will use those lines two zigzag the string and wrap your wheel entirely) and saw the leather to the wheel., This can cost between $5 to $20 and is the most advance option. The third option would be to take your wheel out of the car and take it to a upholstery specialist. They will charge you around $50 for completing the wheel. Remember that we are talking about the wheel ring and not the airbag area!!! Do not cover the airbag !!!!

, There nothing that says cheap as plastic in a car. Does your doors have cheap plastic armrests? Cover them with vinyl or leather !!! again, add a thin foam so it feels softer. This will improve your car interior and even the safety. Once more, do not do this over any airbag !!! Is your center cover a plastic mess? Try looking for some real wood veneer. If you want your veneer to be flexible, just leave it water for 4 to 20 hours, apply it over the console, and sealed it with an air vacuum bag (the same one used to make food last a long time). if you don't like wood, then try some aluminium, although this process is different.

, Do you know where that brand new car smell comes from? 50% is from the fumes of a new carpet. this cost between $50 and $100. Also change your knob and emergency brake for something made out of aluminum, leather or wood.

, You can find them already made for your car online and it cost between 200 to 800 bucks for a typical car. Some companies will allow you to have certain parts in leather and others in leatherette, making the seat feel like real leather but on a lower price. This in combination with a new carpet, will assure you a brand new car smell.

, I don't recommend to get big wheel as it will look tacky. But if your car came out of the factory with hubcaps, this is an easy way to make your car feel more luxurious. If your car has really small wheels, you may change it so the diameter of the rim is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) highers. Do not replace the diameter of your tires. It will destroy the quality of your ride and it will mess with your clocks on the dash.Also, try to look for wheels that would look stock in a car instead of choosing a sportier or wild version.

, So, you don't want your car to be a ""X Brand"" anymore? Then remove the badge. A lot of luxury cars do not have big badges. Do not add any piece of plastic piece of chrome from Walmart, nor paint your car in an exotic (and often expensive) color. If you want to replace the color of your car, try looking into the stock colors of current luxury cars. Avoid having a two tone car at all cost. If your car has any trim, you may get away with paint it in other color (like matte black) and you can risk by adding some chrome to such stock parts. Avoid doing it in the door handles at all cost! Nothing says ghetto more that chrome door handles and pillars.

, Again, be subtle. It has to look as if that car came from the factory with that grill, so avoid anything that is too flashy. Luxury is about quality, not being flashy.

, This will give you some luxury features like hands free communication with your cellphone and it will take all those messy cables from your GPS unit out of the way. You may want to improve the speaker of your car to get a better sound quality. Talking about stereos, Avoid a bass in your car !!! Loud doesn't mean better, nor luxurious. crisp and clear sound do ! If you really want a base, try to hide it so no one can see it. Some cars also have replacements for the a/c functions from mechanical switches to screens.

, A car park on the side of the road all the time will never be luxurious.

Drive your dream car.",How to Restore an Old Car," Are you looking for one specific car, a 1969 Charger for example? Or are you looking to do a restoration that falls in your skill set? Maybe you are a great mechanic, but hate body work or vice versa.;
, Some vehicles may need more extensive mechanical work, while others may only need the oil changed. Likewise, some car bodies will be in pristine condition while others might look like a pile of rust. Check for things like a solid structure or a running motor and only take on repairs that you are comfortable with doing.

, The less work you need to do to a car, the more you’ll pay for it up front. The worse condition the car is in, the cheaper it will be up front. Be careful and consider the costs of repairs, also. You wouldn’t want to spend $500 less on a car that will cost your $5,000 more to repair.

, You can find these at auction houses, your father's garage, or basically anywhere as long as you actively look. Some people hold a lot of value in their old cars, and others simply see them as junk. Be sure to negotiate yourself the best deal on the car. You’ll need any money you save for the restore.

, This way you know how big the job will be and approximately how much it will cost right from the get go. This will help you to plan the restore at a pace that you can accomplish without disappointment., It is a common misconception that dents can just be “popped out.” For the most part this is untrue, though for some specific cases there does exist a highly specialized technique called paintless dent repair (PDR).Almost always, fixing a dent will mean grinding off the existing paint, pulling the dent, filling it with body filler, priming to protect the metal, and then repainting the panel.

, Even if you do not like the color or intend to paint the whole car anyway, a healthy coat of paint on all of the panels means a couple of things. First, a lack of serious scratches on original paint means that this car likely wasn’t involved in major accidents that could damage the frame. Second, paint protects the metal panels on your car from rust.Any scratches that are deep enough to feel with your finger will likely need sanded down and repainted. Minimal scratches, such as wash scratches, can be buffed out.
All bare metal should be primed before painting. All metal should be covered with primer, paint, or another appropriate sealant to protect from rust., Even just a small amount of rust will create lasting problems along the metal body panels on your car. If you have any rust you cannot simply paint over it. You should remove it all and if that creates a hole in the panel you will have to patch it. There are no shortcuts with rust., Old cars often sport chrome bumpers, mirrors, or other parts. These definitely shine the vehicle up, but aren’t as tough as they look. If the imperfections are small then you might be able to repair the part.If the chrome is seriously damaged you will have to replace the part or strip the chrome and rechrome it.

, An easy way to disguise floor problems is to use a nice looking floor mat. Make sure you look underneath any mats, seats, or other hiding places for floor damage.


On the extreme end, a hole in the floor will mean welding a patch, priming, and painting inside your cab. This can be a huge project that takes a lot of time.

, Start by taking out your seats. This is usually done by removing the four bolts on the runners that attach the seat to the floor and then lifting the seat out. Even if no repair is needed this will allow you to give the seats and the interior a deep cleaning. Inspect the seats.


If there are any cuts or gashes in the upholstery, you can try to repair them.If they are large or you have multiple damages, your seats may need to be reupholstered.
Stains can often be removed by cleaning with appropriate stain removers. If you can’t get the stain out, you may consider reupholstering the seat.

, It will likely need cleaned up, but if there are any scratches or other damage to the textured plastic it typically cannot be repaired. This means replacing the damaged pieces. A service manual will help.

, If your project has a solid running engine, this is a good time to clean it up and change the oil. If the engine is not in running order, you will need to repair or rebuild it. This can range from a small, quick job to a very tedious and time consuming process. Be sure you know what you are getting into ahead of time.

, From drive belts to radiator hoses and spark plug wires, your car depends on engine accessories to run. When dealing with a restore, keep in mind that these components may be aged and worn. You should take a careful inventory of what needs replaced and replace it., The engine creates the power, but without a solid drivetrain to deliver it to the pavement it’s useless.


Check your transmission fluid and add some if needed.
If you’re restoring a manual shift car (which is likely), check the clutch to make sure it it working properly.

, Be sure that they are not worn, damaged, or flat. If they are flat try filling them up with air. If they do not hold you might be able to patch the leaking tires. If not you’ll need to replace them. The tread should be at least 2/32” deep, but 4/32” is recommended., It is important to have an efficient exhaust. This decreases harmful emissions and also increases gas mileage which saves you money., Once the car has been restored, the only thing left is to do is drive it. Be sure to show the car off to all of your friends.

Immediately take your foot off of the accelerator.,
Quickly have your foot hovering over the brakes.

,Apply the clutch, this is to prevent the engine from stalling.,
Apply the brake immediately after applying the clutch.,
Brake.,
If there is a need to brake while turning: take out a bit of the steering input while braking.",How to Stop Your Car in an Emergency,";
,,, With the foot hovering in the air, the heel not leaning on the floor of the car, immediately apply the foot brake as hard as possible as quickly as possible. For most drivers, not having extensive training in methods like ""threshold"" braking or ""regressive"" braking, this will be the most efficient method of stopping your car quickly and controllably, regardless of road conditions or if the car has ABS or not.


In cars with ABS, especially in slippery conditions, intervals of howling, screeching or squashing tires can be heard, alongside with pulsation in the pedal, jerks to the steering and chassis, as well as loud noises. This is normal and is indicating that the system is doing its job, slowing you down efficiently, under control, allowing better handling and less wear on the tires.
In cars without ABS, a strong and constant squeal or splash sound will be emitted from the tires. The wheel will tighten up, jerk and suddenly feel lighter. There might also be a bit of smoke. The wear of the tires will not be too hard, especially in the wet. The car will not swerve or spin, since the inertia is pushing it forward. In road conditions which are slippery, or in split-grip (when two wheels are on a different surface, like a gravel or grassy shoulder), the front of the car might pull slightly sideways, but the car as a whole will keep on sliding dead ahead to a quick stop.

, If there is indeed a need to make an evasive maneuver, always begin with braking. This will slow you down, to enable this procedure to be done more efficiently and controllably, or to absorb the impact should it occur. While steering around objects is technically quicker than stopping before them, steering is not always possible, due to road conditions, speed and other cars. In the meanwhile, the car is still progressing. It is hard, though, to evade an object when braking. The tendency is to stare at it and pray to stop before it. To look away, you need to shake your head, forcing the eyes to follow it, and than focus on a visual target in a direction of possible escape. In a none-ABS car, looking away will also help to get over the urge to stay on the brakes, which disables steering.

,

With ABS, brake as hard as possible, and turn as normal while braking.
Without ABS, brake moderately hard (about 70%) and release the brake to turn. If youre already in a turn, don't brake too hard or you'll lock up the wheels and be unable to steer.

Don’t try to break the fall with your hands.,
Roll when you hit the ground.",How to Jump from a Moving Car," Jumping from a moving car is very dangerous, so if you must do it, you need to protect yourself. Grab any soft materials you can find in the car—e.g., clothing, newspaper, a stuffed animal—and stuff it into your clothes. Any little bit of padding can go a long way toward helping to break your fall., Before you leap from a moving car, you need to make sure you can survive the fall. 30-35 miles per hour should be about the maximum speed for jumping. Another way to determine the speed of the car is to watch the mile markers and count the length of time it takes to travel each mile. (If it takes 120 seconds to travel one mile, then you are going around 30 mph)., If the car is traveling faster than 30-25 mph, you need to find a way to slow the car down. Think of a way to distract the driver, such as pointing out something on the side of the road, or making a very loud noise. Any small distraction may cause the driver to remove their foot from the gas pedal., Another way to jump at a slower speed is to wait for the car to turn. In order to turn, the driver will need to slow down quite a bit, creating an opportunity for you to jump. If you are planning to jump from the left side of the car, wait until the car is making a left-hand turn. Conversely, if you plan to jump from the right, wait until the car is making a right-hand turn., Scope out the area around you and try to locate a soft place to land. A field, a patch of grass, or a pile of leaves is probably your best bet. Look for a place that is “five seconds” away from you (meaning you could count to five before you reach it).In addition to finding a soft place to land, you must find a place that is free from obstructions.
You want to jump without crashing into a road sign or fence, and you want to avoid landing on broken glass or other objects., When you swing open the door, it is crucial to make sure your open it all the way. You need space to jump with conviction, and you do not want the door to hit you on your way out., When you jump from a moving car, you want to be sure that you won’t be run over by it. So jump backwards and away from the car. Try to propel yourself at a 45 degree angle from the rear of the vehicle., As soon as you exit the vehicle, tuck your body into a tight ball. This is the safest way for you to land. Hug your arms around your body and scrunch up your legs., Position yourself so that your back is what hits the ground. It is important to land on the center of your back, not your shoulder! The center of your back is a large area, which means the force of the impact will be distributed, and you will be less likely to get hurt., Whatever you do, do not try to break the fall with your hands! Do not put your arms out! This is a very common instinct, but you must avoid it. If you put our your arms, could break your wrists., As soon as you feel the impact of the ground, allow your body to roll. You will be traveling at a high speed, and even when you land you will experience forceful inertia. Allowing yourself to roll helps to distribute the impact and prevents you from sliding."

",How to Rescue Someone from a Burning Car," Use your car and park it behind the wrecked car, at least 100 feet (30.5 m) away, and turn on your hazard lights. Deploy traffic cones and other traffic control devices if you have them. In generally other vehicles are far more dangerous for you than the risk of an explosion.;
, Liquids are not explosive, vapor from a flammable substance is. So a leaking gas tank raises the risk of an explosion.

, Tell your location, what has happened, how many persons are in danger and wait for further questions.

, Think first, then act.

, Get the spurt directly in the flames. Use your little capacity as efficiently and as quickly as possible.

, Rush to the driver's window and check how many passengers there are. If they are conscious tell them to unbuckle themselves and try to get out.

, If the doors are smashed in, try to take them out through the windows. If the windows are not completely smashed out, take your shirt off and wrap your fist in it. Punch through the glass and rip large shards off, so the person can get out. Don't take a lot of time doing this, cuts are not as life threatening as an explosion.

, If the buckling mechanism is damaged the belt will need to be cut.

, The explosion will certainly kill them, if they are not removed.

, When the victim is out of the car, carry / drag them hastily away from the dangerous car, at least a good 100 feet (30.5 m), try putting them behind your car.

",How to Survive When Your Car Breaks Down in the Desert,"


Keep your cell phone fully charged. You may not have reception in the area where you break down, but if you choose to leave your vehicle and travel closer to civilization, you may be able to pick up reception.
Bring hard copies of your maps. Just because your cell phone is working now does not mean that your cell phone will work if you get stuck in the wilderness of a desert. MapQuest maps are great for to and from directions, but you might consider an atlas to have a better picture of the area 360 degrees around your breakdown site.
Pack plenty of food and water. Bottled water and nonperishable food items make great snack items, but they can also generally keep until the next trip.
Make sure that you have your spare tire with your vehicle in case of a flat. With that, ensure that all of your tire-changing tools are packed in the vehicle as well.
Keep blankets in the back of your vehicle. They don't take up much room, and you will be grateful to have them when the temperature drops.
Keep a small emergency kit with matches and/or a lighter, flares, a flashlight, first aid supplies and other miscellaneous items in your vehicle.
Additional items to consider keeping in your vehicle are tire repair goo and a small tire pump. You may not be strong enough to change your tire, but you can probably patch and refill the air every couple of miles to get you to a safe location.
You might also think about packing a signal mirror, a weapon and comfortable hiking shoes, just in case.;
,, This will help you in the event that a decision has to be made regarding leaving the vehicle to seek help or staying with it to flag someone down to assist.

, Get trained in how to change a tire, how to cool an engine, etc.

,, Your best survival is to stick with the vehicle, try to repair it and/or flag down another driver.

,,,, Let them know your departure time and estimated time of arrival so that they can seek emergency help if you are gone considerably longer than expected.

Get a yearly car inspection.,
Maintain your electrical systems.,
Check the fuel lines and tank.,
Install added parts and accessories correctly.",How to Prevent a Car Fire1," Take your car to a maintenance shop each year to get it inspected. A mechanic can give you a better idea about your vehicle’s safety and any repairs that you need to get done. While it may seem like an added expense, it costs less to keep your car maintained than it does to replace a car that has broken down or, worse, caught fire.;
, Two-thirds of vehicle fires are caused by electrical system failures or malfunctions, so keeping your car’s electrical system maintained is essential for reducing your fire risk. Make sure that your battery is in good condition and is properly hooked up, and check that none of your wiring is frayed or damaged.Get your vehicle’s electrical system checked during your regularly scheduled maintenance, such as oil changes or when you get your yearly car inspection.
Immediately repair any issues that are found.
If you cannot pay for repairs, find an alternative means of transportation until you can.

, Look for cracked fuel lines, bad fuel injectors, and fuel leaks.Bad fuel lines can lead to a flare-up, which can cause a vehicle fire. If your tank is compromised, then it can leak fuel, increasing your risk of fire.


Fifteen percent of deaths related to car fires happen due to faulty fuel lines or tanks., Aftermarket parts like extra lights or stereo speakers can be a fun addition to your vehicle, but they can also cause a hazard if they aren’t correctly installed. Get these items installed professionally unless you know what you are doing because improper wiring or overloading your battery can make your vehicle unsafe.


Consult a professional.
Always follow the exact instructions on a product or don’t install it in your car.
Make sure that all wiring is securely attached.

Avoid storing flammable materials in your vehicle.,
Avoid smoking in your car.,
Keep your car clutter-free.,
Carry a fire extinguisher and fire blanket.,
Practice defensive driving.,
Watch for downed power lines.,
Avoid driving if you’ve spilled oil.,
Choose a safe area to park.",How to Prevent a Car Fire2," While you may occasionally need to transport items such as gas cans, lighter fluids, or propane gas, don’t leave these items in your car on a regular basis because doing so can lead to fire. Only make short trips while carrying flammables, and immediately remove them from the vehicle once you’ve arrived at your destination.


When you do transport flammable materials, take safety precautions. For example, gasoline should only be transported in small amounts that are secured in a proper container. You should also ventilate the vehicle.
Don’t place gas or propane in your passenger areas., Smoking cigarettes can lead to a fire if you accidently leave a burning cigarette in your vehicle or if hot ash falls onto flammable material, such as paper. Your risk further increases if you carry a lighter to light the cigarettes.

, Throw out trash and avoid storing items in your car. Allowing these items to remain in your vehicle can create a fire hazard. Not only do extra items, especially crumpled paper, act as fuel if there’s a spark, they also make it easier for you to accidentally leave a flammable item in your car.


For example, a flammable liquid could roll under a pile of trash, potentially resulting in a fire.

, A fire extinguisher and fire blanket can help you put out a fire. Purchase a fire extinguisher that is made for an automobile because the causes of a car fire are often related to electrical issues or combustible fuel, which require a different type of extinguisher.You can find fire extinguishers for automobiles at your local auto parts store, home improvement store, or online.

, Vehicle fires can happen as part of a car accident, so avoid reckless or aggressive driving.While it can be frustrating to give up the right-of-way or to drive slowly, making choices that keep you safe can help you reduce your risk of fire.


Sixty percent of deaths that occur due to car fires happen during a fire that was caused by a car accident., Be careful when driving around after a storm has occurred because you can encounter dangers like downed power lines. If the downed power line still contains an electrical charge, it could ignite materials in or on your vehicle.

, During an oil change, you may accidentally spill oil on part of your vehicle. If this happens to you, wash away the oil before you try driving again. Having any amount of oil on your engine can lead to a vehicle fire., The mechanical parts of your car can be hot, and parts of the system can ignite dry materials that they come in contact with. Make sure that you don’t park around high grass or in an area where materials such as trash can come in contact with your undercarriage or catalytic converter.Instead, choose a flat area that is empty of debris, such as a driveway or the street.

Watch for rapid changes in fuel or fluid levels.,
Look for signs of an overheating engine.,
Notice blown fuses.,
Watch for cracked or loose wiring.,
Listen for loud sounds in your exhaust.,
Replace a missing oil or fuel cap.,
Check for broken or missing hoses.",How to Prevent a Car Fire3," If you car is leaking fluids, then you should see sudden, unexpected drops in your fuel or oil.Notice if you start needing to refuel more often or if the oil you just added to your vehicle is no longer showing on the dip stick. These can be signs that you have a leak that needs to be fixed immediately.

, An overheating engine can quickly lead to trouble. Even if it doesn’t result in fire, it will likely result in a stalled vehicle. While an overheated engine can cause you a lot of headaches, it’s not hard to spot the symptoms.


Signs will include the temperature gauge warning light coming on, a smell of burning metal or rubber, a thumping or ticking sound, steam coming from under your hood, or a hood that is hot to the touch. You may also see that your coolant is low or leaking, and your car may not perform as well as it usually does.If you notice any of these signs, stop driving your car and get it checked immediately.

, If your car has more than one blown fuse in a short period of time, then you need to get the engine checked. Blown fuses are a warning sign that something is wrong and that your car is at risk., Cracked or loose wiring is a huge fire risk, so you need to get it repaired immediately.Don’t continue to drive a vehicle with damaged wiring.


Check around your engine by looking over the wiring. Don’t touch or remove anything.
If you notice any wires sticking out from anywhere, get them checked out.

, If you feel any clunking or cracking sounds in your exhaust system, then you may have a blockage or damage in your exhaust.Avoid having a buildup of gas or allowing a leak to continue by getting your exhaust system checked.

, A missing oil or fuel cap can be a hazard because oil and fuel are both flammable.Additionally, items can get into the system because of the missing cap, which can put your vehicle at risk.

, While they aren’t that common, broken and missing hoses can compromise your vehicle or allow flammables to leak from your vehicle. Replace any hoses that you discover are damaged or missing.Look for leaks.
If you notice that fluids in your car are dropping unexpectedly or that your air conditioning has stopped working, get your hoses checked.
Glance under your hood to see if everything looks like it’s in good condition and properly connected.

Don't panic.,
Check that the car is actually fully locked.,
See whether it's possible to wind down a window.,
Call for help.,
Use this approach if you are around people.,
Ask the person to try the outside handles of the car to see whether they release or not.,
Consider breaking a window.,
Get out with extreme care.",How to Get Out of a Locked Car," Cars are not airtight, just breathe normally and you'll get all the oxygen you need. If you have been in an accident or it's too hot or cold in the car, stay calm and work quickly to try to get out. Speed is only of the essence if the car is likely to burn or if the temperature is rising or falling quickly.

If you are feeling too hot, remove clothing. Too cold, add clothing. Be especially attentive to children, the elderly and pets who are likely to feel temperature extremes much faster.

, Try to open every door that you are able to reach to see if every door is locked. If you have had an accident or being wedged in somehow, it's possible that not all the doors are locked. If you find one that opens, exit through this one, being sure to check for traffic and pedestrians before you do so. Help others to get out.
, If a window will unwind, you can climb out of it to get out of the car. Check each window that can be unwound to see if any work. If so, carefully climb out without placing pressure on the glass if it is still visible. Check for traffic and pedestrians before freeing yourself from the car. Help others to get out., Call your usual automobile association rescue crew and have them come out to release you from the car. Explain what has happened and make it very clear if the need is urgent due to the temperature and having children on board, etc. They may consider sending emergency services to you if that proves to be faster.

You could call emergency services direct instead if you consider that would be more appropriate in the situation.

, Note that this method may not be useful if you need to get out in a hurry, such as if you're concerned that the car might be about to catch on fire after an accident. Try to attract the attention of someone passing by. Try one or more of these approaches:

Bang on the inside of the windows and call out to attract attention.
Write a note and hold it against the window to explain that you need help to get out.
Wave something around in the car to attract attention.

, If they do, then you can get out of the car via that door. If they do not, ask the person if they can seek help for you or perhaps break the door or window in some way., This means making a mess and potentially causing injury, so take precautions to lessen the harm. Avoid the windshield unless you have no other choice, as it's made to be unbreakable (safety glass) and even if you did manage to shatter it, the stickiness of safety glass can make it hard to get through and you'd need to push the majority of it out before you could get out. Side and rear windows are the best options for escape.

If you have no tools or heavy objects to break the window with, use your feet. If you have high heels, these might work when placed at the center of the window. Aim to kick near the front of the window or along the hinges (see the demonstration in the video below). Be aware that it's very hard to break a window by kicking, so find these breakpoints.
If you have a heavy object, aim for the center of the window. A rock, hammer, steering wheel lock, umbrella, screwdriver, laptop, large camera, etc., might all serve as suitable battering objects. Even the keys might work if you're strong enough.

If you've already thought ahead, you might have a window breaking tool handy in the car. There are various tools available, such as a ""center punch"", which is a small tool that could be easily stowed in the driver's side door or on the dashboard, for fast retrieval. This power punch is usually spring-loaded and can also be found in a hammer shape. Failing that, you could also carry your own small hammer.



, Help passengers to get out with the same extreme care; in particular, don't drag them over the glass but lift up and over. You may be able to open a door from the outside rather than having to have every other person clamber out. Call your repairer to come tow the car away for fixing and get a taxi home.

If there has been an accident, report to police.

Be reasonable.",How to Survive in a Car Submerged in Snow," If you are traveling with passengers, make sure that no one is injured. There are bound to be a few anxious people, and try to do your best to calm everyone down. Explain that it is a common situation, and that you will figure out a way to escape the car.;
, Obviously, getting out of a car submerged in snow is not the simplest of tasks. Before you even begin to make your escape, view the circumstances. Are you entirely submerged, or is the hood of the car over the snow? Can you see outside? Is your car right-side up? These are the first questions you should ask yourself before attempting any sort of plan.


If you can see outside, and you are positive that the car is nowhere near halfway submerged, turn on the engine. Let the wheels spin for about ten seconds. If the car is not moving, stop turning the wheels. This will create a bowl of ice that is shaped like a tire, which will make it nearly impossible to escape.Estimate how submerged you are. If you are more than three feet under snow; which is unlikely; digging your way out is not a plan that will have a high chance of working. If you are a very short distance from the surface, try digging out. Be extremely careful while digging, as the tunnel can easily cave in and suffocate you. If the door of your car does not open easily, do not try to force it open. It could possibly spill a load of snow into the car, which will do more bad than good.
Try rocking the car back and forth. With the engine on, switch back and forth between reverse and forward along with moving around the vehicle to keep it moving. As soon as the vehicle shifts, switch the engine to forward and try to drive out. If this doesn't work for twenty minutes, stop and turn off the engine. This will do better with a group, and not a single person., Passengers in the car will most likely have a cellphone with them. Call a car towing company, or someone who can help you. If you have trouble getting service, try pressing the antenna of the phone against the radio while it is playing. Most cellphones will follow the radio's path of service and will get a few bars.Make sure that you give an extremely detailed description of where you are. You will not be clearly visible if you are submerged, and they may drive right past you. Be careful who you call if the phone battery is depleted.

, In most cases, this is the last thing anyone wants to do in a situation like this. Most people think that the engine is the only thing keeping them alive in the freezing temperatures. However, if the tailpipe is covered in snow, the engine shouldn't be on for more than fifteen minutes for every hour.If the engine runs while the tailpipe is submerged, Carbon Monoxide; a poisonous, odorless gas; will escape back up the tailpipe and will gather in the vehicle. Signs of present Carbon Monoxide are drowsiness, dizziness, and headaches. If these symptoms begin occurring to you or anyone in the vehicle, turn off the engine immediately.

, Even something as simple as restaurant mints or crumbs in between seat cushions can keep a person alive. If there are multiple people in the vehicle, share all food. If you end up dying, you wouldn't want people to think 'that was the selfish dude who wouldn't share any of the granola bar'. Kindness can help you later on. If you have bottled water, drink or empty out about one fourth of it. Because ice takes up more space than water, the bottle may expand until it breaks. This will leave you without any water at all. If no water is available, eating snow is also a choice. Although eating snow is an option, it is less favoured. The snow will lower your body temperature. Snow can be melted using a can and a match, but boiling it for one minute may not rid it of germs sometimes found in snow.

, Officers recommend that people remain in the car if no easy escape is available, or if help isn't within one hundred yards.Do not try to navigate unless you are wet and the car engine isn't starting. At this point, your wet clothes will most likely freeze, and you will be risking hypothermia and freezing to death.

, Even something as simple as waving an open umbrella can get someone's attention.If your headlights are not covered in snow, flash them at anyone passing by to signal for help., After a few days in a stuck car, you may begin to lose common sense. Do anything you can to keep your mind sharp and aware; i.e., read a book/the car's manual, keep track of the days you've been stuck, do an old Sudoku puzzle, etc. These things will help you remain sane and will help the days past by easier.

, After many days in the car, you will most likely not have a high chance of surviving. It's a little depressing, but if you have a writing utensil and some spare paper, you may want to write goodbye notes to friends and family. This will help you occupy your time, even though you probably won't need to worry about your friends reading them.

This method, and in fact most methods of hot wiring a car, will only work on cars older than the mid-90s. Newer models are equipped with a whole host of locking mechanisms in place to keep you from hot-wiring the car unless you're intimately familiar with the quirks of the model. If you try this on a 2002 Honda Civic, you're likely to end up setting off alarms and locking the starter, meaning no one can drive it.
If you have access to the owner's manual, check to make sure the steering column and gear selector can be overridden. Serious damage to the shifting mechanism and steering column can result from this method.;
, These are usually held in place with concealed clips or #2 Phillips-type screws. Remove them and pull the access panels free.


Alternatively, on some much older models, you can break the locking pins in the ignition by hammering a flathead screwdriver into the keyhole and turning it over. It's very difficult--if not impossible--to do this by hand, but if you think the model is sufficiently old to allow for it, you can give it a shot.

, Once you remove the panels on the steering column, you should see a roil of electrical wires. Don't be intimidated, learn to recognize the right bundle. There will typically be three main bundles of wires:


Wires leading to the column-mounted controls on one side, like lights, cruise control, and other indicators
Wires leading to the column controls on the other side, like wipers or seat warmers
Wires leading to the the battery, ignition, and starter leading straight up the steering column

, One of these will be the primary power supply for the ignition switch, one will be ignition wires, and the other will be the starter. The other colors will vary depending on the manufacturer. Read the owner's manual or look online to be sure you can identify all possibilities.


Sometimes the ignition wires are brown and the starter wires yellow, but the battery wires are most usually red. Again, the only way to be sure is to read the owner's manual. You're not MacGyver; messing with the wrong wires will get you electrocuted.

, Wrap them with electrician's tape if available, and do not allow them to short against metal vehicle components. Connecting these will provide electricity for the ignition components, so the engine is able to run when the starter is turned.

, You should see the dash lights and other electrical components come alive at this point. If all you want to do is listen to the radio, you're done. If you want to drive the car, you'll need to spark the starter wire, which can get dangerous., This will be live, so you need to extremely careful and keep close hold of your bare wires. Touch the end of this to the connected battery wires. Don't try to twist it on, just spark it against the battery wires to start the car.

, If you get the car to start, rev it a few times so you don't stall out and have to do this process again.


Once the engine starts, you can detach the starter wire and continue on your way. When you want to kill the engine, simply unfasten the battery wires from the ignition wires and the car will die., You've got the car started and you're ready to get your engine pumping and let your car loose, right? Wrong. While your car is running, the steering column is probably locked at this point, meaning that you'll have to break it to be able to steer, unless you want to drive straight off a cliff or something.


On some models, all you'll need to do is pop off the metal keyhole which will release a spring and break the lock. If you already tried to jam your screwdriver in there earlier because you've got a mid-70s to mid-80s vehicle, the lock is probably already broken.
Some models respond well to a healthy dose of elbow grease. Crank the wheel hard to either side as if you were trying to twist it free. You could also use a hammer to fix in the wheel and use for leverage. You should hear it break and the wheel will be free, so you'll be able to drive normally.

Position the drill on the keyhole about 2/3 of the way up.,
Drill in about the length of a key.,
Put the screwdriver in the same way you would put your key in.",How to Hotwire a Car2," Your goal with this method is to destroy the lock pins and allow you to turn the car over using a screwdriver, rather than the key. This is commonly done on cars the keys to which are lost.

, Every lock pin has two sections followed by a spring, so drill it more than once, removing the drill each time to allow the bits of the lock inside to fall into place.

, It doesn't have to go in deep because the pins are already broken. Use it the same way you use your key, just turn it about a quarter-turn in a clockwise direction to try to turn the engine over.Warning: this method will destroy your key switch and make it so that anyone with a screwdriver or a strong fingernail can steal your car.

Open the hood and locate the red coil wire.,
Get out your jump cables.,
Locate the starter solenoid.,
Unlock the steering wheel.,
Connect the solenoid to the positive battery terminal.",How to Hotwire a Car3," Both the plug and coil wires are located at the rear of almost all V8 engines. Four-cylinder engines have them placed on the right side, near the center of the engine. Six-cylinder engines are on the opposite: left side, near the center of the engine.

, Run a jump cable from the positive battery terminal to either the positive side of the coil, or the red wire that leads to the coil. This will give power to the dashboard, which is essential if you want to start the engine.

, On Ford cars, it is on the right-side fender well, near the battery. On GM cars, it is on the starter under the steering wheel.

, Place a flat blade screwdriver in the top center of the steering column, pushing between the wheel and the column. You want to push the locking pin away from the wheel. Don't worry, you're allowed to be rough here.


The locking pin will not break or set off any alarms and you should be able to find the solenoid should be underneath.

, You will see a small wire at the top of the solenoid and the positive battery cable below. Remove the ignition switch wire from the solenoid and, using an insulated screwdriver, short the solenoid’s positive post to the terminal where the ignition switch connects.


Doing so will apply 12 volts directly from the battery. This should activate the solenoid, and the starter should crank the car.

Get out of the car immediately.,
Do not stop to take anything with you.,
Get off of the tracks.,
Run towards the direction from which the train is coming.",How to Escape if Your Car Is Stalled on the Tracks of an Approaching Train," Do not honk your horn and expect the train to stop; a train will not be able to come to a complete stop immediately. Even if it is slowing down, it will still plow through you before it can come to a stop. Do not attempt to play chicken with a moving train. It's not backing down; you must. Get out of the car, and tell any passengers do to the same.;
, Do not risk your life to gather objects from the back seat (unless they are infant passengers). You may be too late. You may want to take a cell phone if it is in easy reach.

, As in, as soon as possible.

, Do not attempt to run away from the train; when the train collides with your car, the wreckage may fly through the air and hit you. Run in the opposite direction of the train. It may be best to take cover, if there is any, to avoid flying debris from the car being smashed by the train.

Drive slowly.,
Keep the vehicle on smooth, flat ground.,
Go as straight as possible.,
Pull over to a safe spot.,
Don’t go far.,
Try to make it to a gas station.,
Keep a spare in your vehicle.,
Call a tow truck.,
Invest in a set of run flat tires.",How to Drive a Short Distance on a Flat Tire," Try not to go faster than about 15-20 miles per hour on a flat. Doing so may cause irreparable damage to the metal wheel beneath the tire, and could even cause you to lose control of the vehicle. Press down on the accelerator lightly, or, if possible, idle along until you find a suitable place to pull over.Traveling at high speeds will just damage your wheel faster, as higher speeds will subject the wheel to greater forces, without the tire to protect it from bumps and debris.
If you’re headed downhill, let the car coast gently on its own momentum with your foot poised on the brake.;
, Avoid potholes, steep inclines and broken patches of asphalt. Rough road conditions can bang up your rims, causing them to bend and putting your vehicle out of alignment. You should also beware of wet or sandy terrain that could cause you to slip, sink or become stuck.Paved roads, parking lots or the shoulder of the highway or interstate will be your best bet.

, Don’t take any steep curves or try to navigate winding avenues while you look for place to pull over. Instead, coast ahead slow and straight, turning the wheel gently when you have an opportunity to exit the flow of traffic. Take the most direct route to get where you’re going.Resist any drag created by the flat by holding the wheel steady, but don’t struggle against it so hard that it compromises your ability to steer.
Turning sharply places more strain on the edges of the rim.

, The first opportunity you get, make your way off the main road and head for the first place you see where traffic is not too heavy. Make sure the vehicle has come to a complete stop, then engage your parking brake and turn on your emergency flashers to signal to other motorists that you’re experiencing car trouble.Pull over somewhere level in case you need to lift your car up on a jack.
Don’t get out of your car until you’re sure that traffic is clear on the driver’s side., You should never attempt to drive any further than a couple hundred yards on a flat tire, even if it isn’t completely deflated. This may not be enough distance to get you to an auto garage, but you can at least creep along until you’re away from the hazards of the highway. Remember to go slow and pull over as soon as you’re able.You can change a tire almost anywhere in a pinch, so don’t bother trying to find a designated parking area for your car.
Get yourself to safety before worrying about how to fix your vehicle.

, If there’s a gas station within sight, and you’ve been fortunate enough to avoid a total blowout, you may be able to steer the vehicle in carefully and inflate the tire at an air pump. Gas stations also typically stock the sort of supplies needed for basic auto repairs, like tire patching kits, which means there are few better places to be if you experience a flat.Don’t push yourself too hard to get to a gas station. If your destination is more than half a mile away, you’ll be better off pulling over where you are.
In some cases, gas station attendants are trained to be able to help stranded drivers change flat tires., Most newer vehicles comes equipped with a spare tire either on the back or in a separate compartment in the trunk. If your car or truck is among them, you’re in luck. Just switch the flat tire out with the spare and you’ll be able to make it to a garage for a full repair.If you’re not sure how to change a tire yourself, consult your vehicle’s owner’s manual for a step-by-step walkthrough.
Compact spare tires (also known as “donuts”) are designed to carry you about 50 miles maximum, and can only withstand speeds up to 55mph., If you aren't able to make it to a garage or change the tire yourself, you may have no choice but to get a tow. Once you make the call, a wrecker service will be dispatched to take your vehicle to the nearest auto repair center so that you can get the problem fixed without delay. In some cases, the person that shows up may even be able to patch the damaged tire right then and there.Signing up for a roadside assistance program like AAA can be a big help should you find yourself in a bind.
Typically, you can expect to wait 45 minutes to an hour for the tow truck driver to arrive. That’s still probably not much longer than it would take for you to change the tire yourself.
Keep your cell phone charged when you’re on the road in case you need to place a call in the event of an emergency., Run flat tires are specially engineered to be safe to drive on even after they’re totally deflated. The reinforced flat acts as a cushion against the wheel that eases the stress of coasting to a safe stopping location. Whether you don’t have any experience changing a tire or you’d simply prefer not to, run flat tires can save you quite a bit of inconvenience.Some run flat tires can allow drivers to keep going for up to 100 miles at a reduced speed before wearing out."

Push on your car door.,
Chip away the ice.,
Pour lukewarm water over the rubber seals.,
Spray on commercial de-icer.,
Start the car remotely.,
Heat the frozen seal with a blow dryer.",How to Open Frozen Car Doors1," Apply pressure by leaning on your frozen door. Push as hard as you can against the door. The pressure could break the ice around the door's seal, enabling you to open the door.


This section assumes you can unlock your car, but not open it. If the lock itself is frozen, skip to the section below.;
, If the ice has formed a thick crust, break it off the seal of the door on all sides, and off the handle if necessary. If you don't have an ice scraper, use any stiff plastic object, such as a spatula or credit card. Metal objects may scratch the glass or paint.

, Fill a cup, bucket or another container with lukewarm water. Pour the water around the seal of the door to thaw the ice. You may need to repeat this several times if the ice is thick. Once the door is open, dry off the inside of the seal with a towel to prevent re-freezing.


Never use hot water, or the temperature difference could shatter your window glass.Even cold water from the hose can do the trick, since it is warmer than the ice.Car doors most often freeze where the rubber seal is worn or damaged, allowing water to seep in and freeze. If you notice any damage, focus on that area while pouring.

, You can find de-icer products at auto shops and hardware stores. These both dissolve the ice, and leave lubricant behind to help prevent further moisture from collecting.In a pinch, you can substitute a homemade mixture:


Rubbing alcohol can dissolve ice, but repeated use may damage your rubber gasket.
Some varieties of windshield wiper fluid are mostly alcohol, and can serve the same purpose.
Diluted white vinegar is a last resort, as it leaves a lingering smell and — according to some — may leave pock marks on the window glass., If you have a remote car starter, use it and let the heat thaw the car door from the inside. This could take up to 10 minutes.

, If you have a battery-operated model or an extension cord long enough to reach your car, this is another DIY way to melt the ice — but potentially a hazardous one. Move the blow dryer constantly back and forth across the door seal. Too much heat in one spot could break the glass, especially if there are existing cracks or chips."

Spray lubricant on the key or lock.,
Blow warm air into the lock.,
Heat the key.",How to Open Frozen Car Doors2," This works best if you spray the key, or place a straw against the lock and spray through the straw. You may use any of the following:Commercial deicer
Rubbing alcohol
PTFE powder lubricant (best for prevention)
Warning: avoid WD40, grease lubricant, and silicone lubricant, which can gum up the lock. Graphite is safe in small quantities.
Do not combine multiple lubricants., Place a cardboard toilet paper roll or another cylindrical object over the lock to direct the air. Heat the lock by blowing into the roll with your breath or a blow dryer.This may take some time.

, Only try this if the key is 100% metal and does not contain an electronic chip. Hold the key with thick gloves or tongs, and heat it above a match or lighter. Insert the key into the lock and wait for the ice to thaw.

Petroleum products and cooking spray are common DIY options, but they can wear down the rubber over time.

, Have your rubber door seals replaced if you see any tears. These let water seep in and freeze your door shut.

Find your tool of choice.,
Wedge the door open.,
Insert your rod.,
Press button and unlock.",How to Break Into a Car1," The basic method for breaking into a car with automatic locks without damaging anything is to wedge a space in the door and use a long poker to hit the lock button. It may be crude, but it's more or less exactly what a locksmith will do if you call one, except doing this won't waste you $80 bucks for five minutes of work. To do this, you'll need one wedge and one poker.Possibilities include:



The best wedges can include putty knives and door stops, the thinner the better. Ideally, you want to open up only as much space as is necessary to insert your poker. Locksmiths use an inflating balloon to pump air and create space.

The best pokers include the antenna from the car, unscrewed, and a straightened wire hanger. You might need a pair of pliers to straighten out the hanger, and consider doubling it up to have better control and pushing power when you get to the lock button. Pretty much any tool that is narrow enough to fit through the window crack and long enough to reach the lock button will work.;
, Jam a doorstop or equivalent wedge-like tool into the space between the upper part of the door and the car. Firmly tap the wedge into the door/car space using the heel of your hand.


If you are concerned about damaging your car's paint, cover the wedge with cloth or some kind of felted surface to protect the paint before beginning.

, The jammed wedge will create a gap between the door and the car body. Insert your rod into the space between the door and the car body. Guide the rod towards the lock button.

, Firmly press the button with your rod. It may take a few tries to get at it, but once you do, you'll have successfully broken into your car. Open the door and retrieve your keys.

Lasso the lock with a coat hanger.,
Consider using a slim jim, or fashioning your own.,
Pick the passenger side door.,
Insert your tool.,
Lower the coat hanger in.,
Find the pin.,
Gently pull the pin towards the rear of the car.",How to Break Into a Car2," The biggest difference between breaking into a vehicle with manual locks is that you have to pull up on the locking pin once you get in if you want to do it manually. Follow the same directions, wedging and poking through the space you create, but then you'll have to carefully pull up to unlock the car.


Pushing a button is one thing, but lassoing the pin is much more difficult. You'll have to slip the loop over the head of the lock nub like a noose an pull up to unlock the car. It may take a few tries to get it.

, A slim jim, otherwise called a lockout tool, is a car tool commonly issued to police officers to help open doors with manual locks. It's used by wedding into the door mechanism itself, between the window and the weather stripping, hooking the locking pin, and pulling it from the inside. If you've got access to a slim jim, it can be a quick fix.


Create your own by straightening out a coat hanger, leaving only the curved (hook) end in its original shape. You may need to use needle nose pliers to unwind the coat hanger to straighten it out, and double it over to reinforce it.
Note that this method is not recommended for cars with automatic windows and locks. Those cars have a lot of wiring in their doors, which might get damaged in this breaking in process.

, There is usually less wiring on the passenger side than on the driver's side door, making it somewhat easier to break in.

, Identify the black rubber weather stripping along the lower edge of your car window. The locking mechanism is generally lined up with the lock itself, usually toward the back of the door itself.


With your fingers, peel back this rubber strip back from the window slightly to expose the gap between the window and the outer part of the car door. Gently insert your straightened coat hanger, curved end first, into the gap between the window and the weather stripping., You should be able to lower the coat hanger into this gap a few inches without resistance, then start feeling for the pin.


If you can look at the vehicle's shop manual, you'll be able to have a great sense of where the locking pin will be and how to access it. If you blindly dig around in the door, you do risk messing up the wiring and causing damage. Try to find out where the locking pin is before you insert the slim jim.

, Move the coat hanger around in the gap until you feel a small pin. This pin can be pulled to disengage the door lock. It will usually be located about 2 inches (5 cm) below the bottom of the window, near the interior door handle.

, When you find the pin, hook it and gently pull. If successful, you will feel the pin move and hear the door unlock. After successfully unlocking the door, gently pull the coat hanger out and open the door to get your keys back.

Find the emergency cord.,
Pull the cord.,
Crawl in.",How to Break Into a Car3," If your trunk is unlocked by any chance, but the cab is locked with your keys inside, open it and look around inside for the emergency open trunk cord that opens into the car. It is often in the trunk ""door"" or the roof of the trunk.

, Once you find the cord, pull it. This will unlock the back passenger seats allowing them to fall forward in some models of car. This is a common feature in some sedans.

, Once the passenger seats are unlocked, push them forward. Now you can climb into the car through this new entry, and unlock a back passenger door yourself manually.

Find a long, sturdy piece of string.,
Tie a slipknot in the middle of the string.A slip knot, also referred to as a ""slip noose,"" is a sliding knot that will cinch tightly around the object it is fastened to when pulled.This is ideal for unlocking your car, as you'll only need to lasso the lock and pull tight to fasten the knot around the lock.








,
Make two loops.,
Tighten the knot.,
Work your way inside from the corner of the door.The top corner of your door closest to the rear of your car is the ideal place for you to slide your string into your car.,
Pull gently on the door to relieve pressure.,
Maneuver your slip knot into place.Depending on the vehicle you are trying to regain entry into, your physical height, and the kind of string you are using, you may have to try various techniques to lasso your car lock.,
Pull the lock to the unlocked position.",How to Unlock Your Car with String," You will need your string to be skinny enough to fit between the door and door frame, though you might be surprised at the thickness that can make it through the seam of your door. A shoelace is often convenient and is thick enough that it won't break while unlocking your car.






;
,, Make a loop and hold the point where the string crosses itself at the base between your pointer finger and thumb. With the extra string make another loop, which you will also hold where crossed at its base with your pointer finger and thumb.Then:









Insert your second string into your first loop.
Continue holding the crossed string at the base of your fist loop.
Pull your second loop gently through the first, while releasing your hold on the crossed base of the second loop.
Releasing the crossed base of the first loop while continuing to pull your second loop through.

, To prevent your knot from coming loose while forcing it through the seam of your car door, you'll need to pull tightly on the strings leading into and out of the knot. While doing this, also pull outward on the remaining loop that you have pulled through your first loop.Finish your slip knot by:









Holding the string firmly where it feeds into your first loop and where it emerges from your second loop.
Pull the loop and the start/end lines taut to tighten and finish your slip knot.

, This can take some time and patience, but move the string back and forth along the seam of your door, much like a piece of floss, until your string has made it inside.








, This will make it much easier for you to maneuver your string once you have gotten it beyond the seam of the door. Depending on the strength of your string, you may be able to pull on its ends after getting it through the seam to apply outward pressure to the door. Once you do so:









Get a finger-hold on the door, or have a friend do so, and pull lightly on it to relieve pressure and create a small gap between the door and car frame.
Professional locksmiths often use a plastic tool to pry the door open slightly. A rubber wedge is then slid between the door and frame of the car and inflated to keep the door/door seal from getting in the way.If you use a tool to try to pry your door free and make space for your string, this may cause damage to your paint or, if excessive force is used, could even damage your car door.

, Some recommend pulling the knot along the surface the lock is on until the loop catches around the lock.









Once you have lassoed the door lock, maintain even pressure on your string to tighten your slip knot around the lock. Loosening your grip might cause the knot to loosen, requiring you to lasso the lock again.

, Now that your slip knot is cinched tightly around the locking mechanism on the inside of your car, you should be able to disengage the lock by pulling upwards with even pressure.Remember to use steady pressure; a loose line can slip easily off the lock.

Dig out your car.,
Check the tailpipe before you start the engine.,
Put down something gritty around the tires.,
Place solid materials in front and behind the tires to gain traction.",How to Get Your Car Out of the Snow1," Use a shovel or similar tool to clear away any snow that surrounds the car. Try to make it so you can see all the tires. Then, use a screwdriver or a similar tool to break up the ice immediately surrounding the tires. Be careful not to puncture the tires.Remove as much snow as you possibly can.;
, After you’ve dug out your car, make sure that the tailpipe is free of snow. While you may have removed the snow from around it, make sure the tailpipe itself is clear and doesn’t get buried again. This is important, as the exhaust could build up in the car if the tailpipe isn’t clear.

, Pour a gritty substance in front, behind, and on the sides of your tires. Gritty substances will help your tires gain traction when you try to back up or move forward. Some substances you can pour include:


Salt, which will not only help tires gain traction, but will melt the ice and snow underneath them.
Kitty litter.
Sand., If gritty materials don’t work, look for other materials that could help your tires gain traction. This includes pieces of plywood, ridged sheet metal, or similar items. Then, place the items in front of or behind your tires so you can back or drive onto them and then out of the snow.


If you have snow chains, you should put them on."

Turn your all-wheel drive on, if you have it.,
Put your car in the lowest gear.,
Straighten your wheels.,
Rock the car out.,
Ride your brakes.,
Release a little air from your tires, if you can't get out by rocking the car.,
Avoid spinning your tires.",How to Get Your Car Out of the Snow2," If you have all wheel or four-wheel drive, you should make sure it is activated before you try to drive your car out of the snow. Ultimately, the more tires that can spin, the more traction your car will have and the easier it will be to move out of the snow., Instead of just switching your car into drive, make sure to put it into the lowest gear. Putting it in the lowest gear will provide your tires with more power and make sure they spin slower. This will lower the risk that your tires dig a deeper hole into the snow., Turn the steering wheel so your front wheels are as straight as possible. By straightening your wheels, you’ll make it a lot easier to get your car out of the snow. However, make sure to adjust for any obstacles – like fire hydrants or signs – that might be in front of you., Slowly back your car up. If you move a few inches, you’re making progress. Then, drive the card forward. Once again, even a few inches is progress. Continue to do this until you’re in a rocking motion. With a little luck, you’ll make more-and-more progress forward and will be able to get out of the snow.


If rocking the car out doesn't work after about 5 minutes, stop doing it. It could damage your transmission., Because your wheels may be spinning too fast or at an unequal pace, you should press the brakes slightly as you try to rock the car out. This will make it so all your wheels are working to move you out of the snow.


Don’t ride the brakes for too long. If you do this, they could overheat., Take your index finger and slightly push the pin in the center of the tire's air valve to the side. Release air until you can push the wall of the tire in just a little bit. This shouldn't take more than 20 to 30 seconds.


If your tires are completely inflated or even overinflated, this will help your tires to get better traction.
If your tires are already low, don’t let any air out.
If you don’t have any way to re-inflate the tires, don’t let too much air out., If your tires spin and you’re not making backward or forward progress, you should stop the car immediately. This is because tires will slowly be digging themselves deeper into the snow."

Lower and remove the jack.",How to Get Your Car Out of the Snow3," Locate an area near a wheel that is stuck more than the other wheels. Dig out all the loose snow and as much ice as you can. Make sure to clear a level and solid area for the jack. This area should be under a solid metal part of the car that can support the jack.Most cars have several “jack points” – places that are engineered so you can use a jack there. Look in your owner’s manual to find these points.

, After clearing an area for the jack, place something solid on the ground. This way, your jack will be level when you start to crank it up. If the jack isn’t level, it could fall over and injure you., After you’ve positioned it, start to crank the jack up. Crank it up so the lowest tire is level with the other tires. The bottom of the tire should be level with the snow and ice you’ll need to drive on. Be careful, though, as the jack could slip and injure you.Use gloves.
Stand back while cranking it up.
Verify that the jack is stable.

, Place solid items that your tire can gain traction on in the area below the tire. If you have access to it, fill the hole with sand, gravel, and rocks. If not, you can fill it with blankets, plant material, and woodchips.Compact the area after you’ve filled it. You can do this by patting it with a mallet or some other hard object.

, Once you’ve filled the area under the tire, lower the jack if you need to. Chances are, you won’t need to lower it too much. Once you’ve lowered it, carefully remove the jack. Then, with a little luck, you’ll be able to drive out of the snow.

Stay calm.,
Keep your foot on the brake.,
Set the parking brake.,
Slowly recline your seat.,
Open the windows.,
Turn off the vehicle.,
Take off your seat belt.,
Unlock the doors.,
Move in planned unison.,
Watch, listen, and feel for movement.",How to Get out of a Car That's Hanging over a Cliff," It's quite a shock to find yourself teetering on the edge of a cliff, but the more calm and methodical you are, the better your chance of escape. Unless the car is rolling or shifting—in which case you just need to get out as quickly as possible—take a moment to determine your best route of escape.;
, If you came to a rest with your foot on the brake pedal, leave it there until you can set the parking brake. It may be the only thing that's preventing you from rolling off the cliff.

, Pull the brake handle very slowly and smoothly, and stop if you detect any movement. If your foot is on the brake pedal, slowly remove it.


Note that for practically all cars, the parking brake works only on the rear wheels while the brake pedal affects primarily the front wheels (75% front 25% rear.)
If you are turned around such that only your front tires are on level ground, carefully find an object to keep the brake pedal down.

, Reclining your seat while it holds your bodyweight will shift the center of gravity away from the car's engine and towards the back of the car. This, in turn, will reduce the chances of the car tipping forward and rolling off of the cliff's edge., If you have to move within the car to get to a safe exit door, prepare for the possibility that you may need to exit through the window.


If you have electric windows, roll the window of the target door down before you leave the drivers seat (only do this if you can do so without starting the vehicle).
If you won't be able to roll the window down, pick up a small tool that you can use to smash it, such as a wrench or screwdriver, and bring it with you when you move to the door.
You only want to try a window if the door won't open or if opening the door will cause the vehicle to shift.

, If your car is still running, turn it off.

, When you unbuckle it, make sure that it's positioned so that you won't get tangled up in it when you try to move. Instruct your passengers to do the same.

, In the confusion of the situation, it's easy to forget that the doors are locked. If this happens, you or your passengers may panic when you try to open the door and it doesn't open.


A person who panics may try to force the door open, and their movements may cause the vehicle to shift.
It's especially important to remember to unlock the doors if you have passengers in the back seat, such as small children, who may not be able to unlock their doors.

, If there are multiple people in the car, make a plan before anybody moves. Typically, those who are seated closest to the cliff's edge should get out first if possible. This will maintain a favorable balance of weight in the vehicle.


They should climb over the other passenger(s) if necessary, but this should be done as smoothly as possible.
If people can get out simultaneously — if the only occupants are in the front of the vehicle, for example, and they can both exit the doors nearest them — they should exit at the same time.

, If you feel, hear, or see a slight movement, immediately stop what you're doing. Your instinct will probably be to push off from the car and leap out as quickly as possible, but this is not wise if there are other passengers who have not yet exited the vehicle.


Instead, stop for a moment to see if the movement stops.
If you detect a more pronounced movement or movement that doesn't immediately stop, it's time to scramble out as quickly as possible and hope for the best.

Keep a safe distance from other cars.,
Purchase the right tires.,
Slow down.,
Avoid driving altogether.",How to Brake on Ice1," While you might usually tailgate vehicles ahead of you when they’re going slowly, this is very dangerous on icy roads. Stay at least 8 seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you. If you’re not used to winter driving, stay 10 seconds behind.

To measure your following distance, pick a fixed point ahead of the vehicle you’re following. Street signs work best for this. Keep an eye on the car ahead, and start counting once its nose crosses the fixed point you chose. Count until the nose of your car crosses this same point. If you’re in the 8-10 range, you’ll know you’re maintaining a safe distance.
Not all icy conditions need the same stopping distance. At 0° Fahrenheit (-18° Celsius), you need twice as much stopping distance as you would at 32° Fahrenheit (0° Celsius).;
, If you’re in an area that sees a lot of snow and ice, having winter tires on your vehicle will make driving less dangerous. They’re specifically designed to help your car maintain traction in winter conditions; the grooves are typically deeper and angled diagonally.

If you live in a warmer climate, but you’re concerned about icy roads, you should at least get all-season tires., You could have the best winter tires on the market, but you still need to use caution. If you’re driving on icy roads, you shouldn’t go any faster than 45 mph (72 kmh), even on the highway. Driving more slowly gives you more time to react, giving you more distance to immobilize your vehicle., This is especially important if you live in an area where roads don’t usually get icy, but applies even if you’ve seen your share of difficult winters. The best way to deal with an emergency situation is to avoid it altogether. Usually your local authorities will warn you not to go on the roads when it’s too dangerous to do so. Listen to their instructions unless it’s absolutely necessary for you to be driving."

Check if your car has an anti-lock braking system (ABS).,
Stay calm.,
Keep your heel on the floor as you push the brake pedal.,
Push steadily with your foot.",How to Brake on Ice2," Threshold braking is best used with vehicles that don’t have ABS. This system prevents the wheels from locking in an emergency braking situation; so cars without it are more likely to see the wheels lock. In an icy situation, this can be incredibly dangerous and send the car into a slide.

Threshold braking allows you to brake as much as possible without hitting a point that will cause the wheels to lock. Threshold braking is also known as squeeze braking.
Checking the car’s owner’s manual is the best way to know if your car has an ABS. If you’re still unsure, you can ask your mechanic., Understandably, this is difficult to do in an emergency situation, but panicking is a sure fire way to lose control of your vehicle. It’s important to keep your cool if you need to brake on ice.

If you’re worried about how you’ll react in an emergency situation, you can try your hand at driving on ice at certain driving schools., Keeping your heel to the floor lets you use the muscles in your foot to push the brakes rather than the muscles in your leg. This gives you more control.

Avoid slamming the brakes. This will cause the wheels to lock and your car will lose all traction., This is the key to threshold braking. Apply firm, steady pressure to the brake pedal. Your car should slowly start decelerating as you push the brakes. Keep the pressure even, and stop just short of causing your wheels to lock.

You’ll feel feedback in the brake pedal, a certain threshold as you brake. This is when you can get the most deceleration out of your brakes; if you go past this your wheels will lock and you’ll lose traction."
"
Confirm that your car has ABS brakes.,
Keep a firm grip on your steering wheel.,
Brake as soon as possible.,
Push firmly on the brakes.,
Steer carefully to avoid obstacles.",How to Brake on Ice3," You can usually do this by checking your car’s specifications, whether on the internet or with a dealer. The more recent your vehicle, the more likely it is to have ABS brakes. If you’re really unsure, you can always check with a mechanic the next time you get your car serviced., Because ABS brakes do most of the work preventing your wheels from locking, they make it easier for you to steer when you need to brake on ice. Rather than keeping your hands fixed at the 10 and 2 positions, you should shuffle your hands so they always stay on their side of the steering wheel. This means that, even if you need to turn the steering wheel harshly, your arms never cross, giving you more control.

This is very similar to the grip many race car drivers use., While they do a great job of preventing your wheels from locking, ABS brakes don’t work as well on ice and snow as they do on pavement. As such, it’s important to react quickly, then let the system work. It’s crucial to stay alert and always keep your eyes on the road., With ABS brakes, you don’t have to worry about pumping the brakes or applying steady pressure. Just push the brake pedal hard. You might feel the pedal shudder and push back against your foot slightly. This is normal; the ABS is kicking in, relieving some of the pressure from the wheels to prevent them from locking. Don’t remove your foot or pump the brakes, let the system work., Sometimes braking isn’t enough, and you might need to steer away from a possible collision. If you need to steer, make smooth, precise movements. Jerking the steering wheel can cause your car to skid and slide. The wheels will lose their traction and you’ll lose control of your vehicle."

Pull the trunk release.,
Escape through the backseat -- if the driver leaves the car.,
Pull the trunk release cable.,
Pry the latch open.,
Push out the brake lights.,
Use the car jack to pop up the trunk lid.,
If these methods fail, kick the trunk and create noise to attract attention -- if you haven't been abducted.",How to Escape From the Trunk of a Car1," All American cars made after 2002 are required to have a trunk release inside the trunk, thanks to a national law.If you're lucky enough to be in one of these cars, and your abductor was dumb enough to overlook it, find the release and pull it down or up, as the model may require. It will usually be a glow-in-the-dark handle located near the trunk latch, but it may also be a cord, button, or toggle switch, or a handle that does not glow in the dark.;
, Some cars have back seats that fold down to allow access to the trunk. Generally the release for these seats is located inside the car, but there may be one in the trunk as well. If not, try to push, kick, or pry the seats down, and then climb out. If there's a kidnapper involved, make sure he's nowhere to be found, or you won't climb your way to safety by getting into the backseat, just inches away from your abductor.

, If the car is equipped with a cable trunk release that can be operated from inside the car (usually by a lever near the driver's seat), you may be able to pull the cable and open the trunk latch. Pull up the carpet on the floor of the trunk, or pull of the cardboard paneling, and feel for a cable. It will typically be on the driver's side of the car. If no cable is there, search along the side of the trunk. If you locate a cable, pull on it (pulling toward the front of the car) to open the trunk. Pulling the cable toward the front or side of the car will pull up the release handle on the trunk.If there are pliers inside the trunk they may help you grip the cable.

, If you can't find the release cable but have located the latch, then your best bet may be to try to pry it open. Search for a screwdriver, crowbar, or tire iron inside the trunk. There may be a toolkit or tire-changing tool set under the trunk floor. If you find a tool, use it to pry open the trunk latch. If you are unable to pry the latch, you may be able to pry up the side of the trunk. This will provide some ventilation and enable you to signal for help., You should be able to access the brake lights from inside the trunk. You may need to pull or pry a panel off to get to them. Once you have access to them, rip the wires out of them. Then try to push or kick the lights through so that they fall out of the back of the vehicle. You can then signal to motorists or passersby by sticking your hand out through the hole.


Even if you're unable to push the lights out, if you disconnect the wires, you increase the chance that whoever is driving the vehicle (if you've been abducted) will get pulled over by the police for a faulty brake light or taillight.






Just remember that out of all the strategies, this is the one that will make the most noise. If you want to attract attention and haven't been abducted, then creating noise will only help your case.







, Many cars have a jack and a few tools in the trunk along with the spare tire. Sometimes they are underneath the carpet in the trunk, or on the side of the trunk. If you can get to the jack, set it up and crank the jack up under the trunk lid and attempt to keep pumping the jack up until the trunk lid pops open.

, If you just managed to get yourself stuck in the trunk of a car but aren't worried about making enough noise to alert your abductor, then just kick the trunk as much as you can and scream until you alert someone else, who will call for help. If you're in a relatively public place, you can try this method while you search for the latch or trunk release, but know that yelling and kicking is more likely to make you feel hysterical and hyperventilate."
"
Stay as calm as possible.,
If the kidnapper is in the car, make your movements as quiet as possible.,
Be on the lookout for the best time to escape once you pop the trunk open.",How to Escape From the Trunk of a Car2," Trunks aren't completely airtight, and it generally takes at least twelve hours to fall unconscious; more, if you are small or the trunk is large (or both). What could kill you is hyperventilation, so breathe regularly and don't panic. It may get very hot in there - up to 140°F (60°C) - but you still need to stay calm in order to increase your likelihood of escaping.

, Though you'll feel desperate to get out of the car as quickly as possible, if you wildly thrash around, kick, and scream while the kidnapper is driving, then they will hear you and will get angry and may take additional measures, such as gagging you or tying you up. If you've determined that the only thing you have left to do is to try to kick out the trunk and the kidnapper is still driving or it's getting really hot, try to do most of your kicking when the car is driving fast or in a loud environment.


Keep in mind that even if you're being quiet, the kidnapper may be able to hear the sweet ""pop"" of the trunk opening.







, Though you may want to jump out of the car the second you pop open the trunk, unfortunately, you won't be able to do it if the car is speeding down a highway, or you'll jump to your death. Wait until the car has slowed down enough for you to escape from the trunk, like when it's at a stop sign or going slowly in a residential neighborhood.


It's better to jump out of the car while it's moving slowly then when it's completely stopped, because if the kidnapper stops the car and gets out, he may notice that you've popped the trunk open -- and he'll make sure you don't do it again.

Install a trunk release in your car's trunk.,
Keep several key safety tools in your trunk.",How to Escape From the Trunk of a Car3," The vast majority of trunk entrapment cases occur in the victim's own car. The good news is, you can prepare for such an eventuality by installing a trunk release. Check if your car already has a trunk release in the trunk. If it doesn't you may be able to install one as long as yours has an operational electronic trunk release mechanism.

If your trunk can be opened remotely, the easiest thing to do is to hide a spare remote in the trunk. Make sure to tell your children and other family members where it is located and how it is operated.






If your trunk cannot be opened remotely,you can purchase the supplies to install a trunk release yourself for about $4. Have the release installed for you if you are not confident in your mechanical abilities.







, Keep a flashlight, crowbar, and a screwdriver in your trunk. If you can't install a trunk release, keep tools in your trunk that will help you pry open the latch or, at the very least, help you attract attention from passersby.

Be prepared to produce tax returns for at least the past two years. Since your tax returns report all of your taxable income, they may serve as an adequate proof of income for your loan.Also, your tax returns for the past two years can provide a reasonable estimate for how much you will make in the current year. Finally, lenders trust that information provided on a tax return is accurate.Lenders look at gross income, not taxable income, so don't worry if your deductions cause your income to appear lower.
The inability to produce tax returns makes you seem like a higher credit risk.;
, Another method of proving your income is to provide bank statements. If your income varies from month to month because of freelance work, a lender may ask for several months’ worth of statements. These will provide your lender with records of all of your deposits, allowing them to see that you do have income. However, bank statements do not give information about how you earned your income. If you have bank statements but cannot also provide tax returns, expect to pay a higher interest rate. , List all of the invoices you have made for at least the past 12 months. Also, provide details about work for which you have been contracted but haven’t invoiced yet. This information will provide proof of past income and allow a lender to predict future income. Invoices and contracts provide more detail about your sources of income. However, don’t expect lenders to rely on these alone. Invoices and contracts should only be used as a supplement to tax returns and bank statements., If you own your home, a mortgage statement may be used to prove residence. Bring the most recent statement. This will demonstrate that you still reside at this address. The mortgage statement must have your name on it. If the mortgage is not in your name, then the statement will not have your name on it., If you rent, a cancelled rent check can prove where you live. Your landlord must sign a receipt verifying that you live at this address. If you live with relatives and pay rent to them, ask them to sign a statement that you live with them at this address. In this case, you might also be asked to produce mail, such as a bill, addressed to you at this address., Lenders will usually accept a utility bill in your name as proof of your address. Be prepared to provide more than one utility bill. For example, you can provide an electric bill, water bill, sewer bill or phone bill if you have a land line. Be sure that the utility bill has your name on it. If all of your bills are in someone else’s name, such as a spouse or roommate, you will need to provide other forms of business mail in your name at that address., Other business mail includes bank statements, credit statements or other household bills besides utilities. The mail must be addressed to you at your address. Don’t use junk mail. Since junk mail is not specifically addressed to you, it would not suffice as proof of residence., A library card application requires proof of residence. So, it can also be used to verify that you reside at your stated address. Some lenders may accept this as proof of your address. However, be prepared to bring additional documents, such as bills or other business mail., Lenders will evaluate your credit score during the loan approval process. If you do not have a proof of income, prepare several months ahead of time to improve your credit score. This will increase the likelihood of getting approved for an auto loan.Pay all of your bills on time.
Pay off as much debt as possible.
Get a short-term loan for a small amount of money from your bank or credit union to establish good credit. Instead of taking the cash, put the money in an interest-bearing account. Pay off the loan from the account where you parked the money.
Get a secured credit card.
Ask to be an authorized user on another person’s credit card account, such as your spouse or a parent.
Open a store credit card.
Dispute inaccurate or negative information on your credit report.

Create a budget and work out a repayment plan to your creditors. You can find legitimate credit counseling programs at many universities, military bases, credit unions, housing authorities and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service.
Do not work with companies that promise to erase your bad credit or create a new credit identity. These are likely a scam.
Avoid subprime loans. These are often marketing to people with less-than-stellar credit, but the terms are usually unfavorable. Auto loans are easier to get than mortgages because they involve less money over a shorter period of time. Shop around, because you may qualify for a better loan than you think.

, Many car buyers put down approximately 10 percent of the car’s value as a down payment. However, without proof of income, you may be required to make a bigger down payment. Save up as much cash as possible ahead of time to use as your down payment. A bigger down payment not only reduces the amount you have to finance, but it also reassures lenders that you won’t be “upside down” on your loan.Lenders don’t want this to happen, so they’re more likely to approve you for a loan if you have a large down payment.


If you are trading in your old car, this can be applied towards your down payment.
Provide documentation about the source of your down payment.

, If someone is willing to cosign your auto loan, your lender may be more willing to approve it. A cosigner guarantees that you will make all of your payments in full and on time. Also, if you fail to pay, the cosigner agrees to make the payments for you. Your cosigner will need to have a good or excellent credit score. Also, the cosigner will need to provide proof of income and demonstrate stability in their residence and employment.Your cosigner is at risk for payment, so a default can destroy relationship.

, Your dealer may try to convince you that you won’t qualify for a bank loan because you don’t have sufficient proof of income. Don’t fall for this. The dealer may be misleading you in order to get you to work with their financing. Dealer financing often comes with higher interest rates, which can mean a bigger monthly payment. Or, they may stretch the loan out for 72 months or more in order to make the monthly payment lower. In this case, you could still be paying off the loan after you no longer own the car., If you are a member of a credit union, check with them first about getting an auto loan. Credit unions are member- and community-oriented. They offer a user-friendly loan process and competitive interest rates.If you already have a relationship with a local bank, visit a branch and meet with a someone in person. Since they already do business with you, they will be familiar with your financial history and be more willing to work with you., Predatory lenders employ unfair or fraudulent practices. If you cannot provide proof of income, these loans might seem attractive because they are easy to get. However, these loans come with very high interest rates and expensive fees and charges. It’s not always simple to recognize a predatory loan. Be on the lookout for the following red flags.If you are encouraged to put false information on the loan, it’s likely a predatory loan.
If add-on packages come with the loan, such as insurance, theft deterrents or rust-proofing, don’t take the loan. These packages don’t add value and simply inflate the loan amount.
Ads that promise you can get a loan even with bad credit. These loans come with exorbitantly high interest rates.

, If you do decide to go with dealer financing, never leave the dealership without a signed contract. Some dealers will allow you to take ownership of the car before the loan process is completed. Then, a few weeks later you get a phone call saying you didn’t qualify for the loan and must accept a different loan with a higher interest rate.This is a scam. The dealer can adequately assess your credit worthiness and approve you for a loan on the spot.
If they are not willing to complete the loan process with you, then go elsewhere.

, Compare the prices and choose a website that offers the best deals. However, make sure that the website you choose is safe and trustworthy - do not choose a website based on its popularity or the number of people that seem to use it. Once you have picked out a website that you may use in the future, do more research on it and read customer reviews. For example, AutoTrader.com is one website you might want to investigate.


Don't choose a website just because a friend recommends it. Look at the website. If it seems untrustworthy or strange in any sort of way, immediately exit. You never know if that website is uploading viruses onto your computer!

, Look through the selections of car the website offers and choose the best one that appeals to you. Do not choose it merely because of its look or the weak reason ""Everyone has one!"". Choose it because of its good quality and the good price it has.


When choosing a car, be sure to consider whether it will benefit you in the long run, whether the price is worth it, and how much it would cost to maintain it. As little as the prices may seem, they will add up to a big number in the long run if you aren't careful!

, Since you are purchasing a car over the Internet and not at a business, the risk of being cheated or scammed grows higher and you'll want to be extra careful. Once you have filled out all required information, submit it.

This gives you an opportunity to not only examine the car but also the seller. You are looking for a reputable seller who will help you secure a title, if possible. If the seller is pressuring you into buying the car, you should consider walking away from the purchase.


Ask the seller whether they ever had the title and how they came into possession of the car. Explain to them that you are trying to determine whether or not you can obtain the title for the car.
If they seem unwilling to help you or uncomfortable answering questions about how they got the car, you should seriously consider not buying the car. Without the title, you have no way of knowing whether the seller has the legal right to sell you the car. If they don’t have the legal right to sell the car, you could be purchasing stolen merchandise.;
, While you are inspecting the car, be sure to photograph or copy down the car’s vehicle identification number (VIN). Every car is assigned a 17-digit number that identifies the place the car was manufactured, the year, model and make of the car, as well as other identifying features. You can find the VIN number in the following places:


Below the windshield on the driver’s side of the car
In a car’s engine bay on the firewall, which is the wall located between the engine and the passenger compartment.
On a sticker or metal plate located on the doorjamb on the driver’s side of the car., The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) allows people to run a free VIN check in order to determine whether a car has been reported as stolen but not recovered or if a NICB member insurance company listed it as salvage.


You can conduct a VIN search here: https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/vincheck. This website allows you to run up to five free VIN searches in a 24-hour period.
A car that is listed as salvage may have been in an accident, have serious structural problems or be expensive to repair. Many insurance companies will not insure a salvage-title car, which means that you would not be able to register the car in your state.

, If the car has been listed as salvage, you should strongly consider not buying the car unless you are looking to purchase it for parts. If the car has not been listed as salvage or reported as stolen, and they seller seems like a reputable person, you should take steps to acquire the title.

, If the seller seems willing to help you secure the title to the car, state by asking them whether they ever had the title. If they did, in most states you can easily request a duplicate title for a small fee. You can check the state-by-state requirements for replacing a lost title at: http://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php.

, If the seller is not sure whether they ever had the title, you can use the VIN number to run a more extensive vehicle information report, which may help you locate the previous title holder. While you will have to pay a fee for this report from companies such as CARFAX, the report provides the following useful information:


Number of owners and the states where the car was registered.
Information regarding liens on the car.
Accident reports.
Maintenance on the vehicle.
Accident history.
Car title check.
Other damage to the car.
Whether the car was salvaged., If the seller does not have a title but did get a bill of sale when he or she purchased the car then you may be able to use the bill of sale to track down the previous owner.You should check whether the information on the bill of sale matches the information on your vehicle report. Specifically, check if the car was sold in the same state where the car was registered and titled.
Identify the previous owner and try to locate the person using an internet white pages search at whitepages.com. This allows you to search people by name and location in an attempt to locate their phone number.
If you locate the previous owner, call them and ask whether they would be willing to assist you in getting title for the car. You can offer to pay for any fees that they may incur as a way of encouraging them to fill out the online paperwork and transfer title.

, If you are unable to locate the previous owner, you should contact the DMV for that state and explain that you are looking to secure a proper title to the car and give them the name of the seller and the VIN number for the car and the bill of sale. The DMV may be able to help you or explain what, if any, additional steps you need to take.


You can find contact information for motor vehicle departments in the United States at: http://www.dmvnv.com/50_state_dmv_list.html.

, If you are unable to get the title for the car, you should consider hiring a title company to try and get the proper title for you. You can do this before you purchase the car or if you already purchased the car without a title. You can find businesses that help you get titles by conducting an internet search for “title recovery services.”


Before hiring a title recovery company, check with the Better Business Bureau at https://www.bbb.org, to see whether there have been any complaints filed against the company.

, If you decide to purchase the car with or without the title you should draft a bill of sale. A bill of sale is a sales agreement between two parties. Some states require that you have a bill of sale in order to transfer title. Even if it is not required, you should still get a bill of sale for your own records to document proof of purchase. You should have the bill of sale notarized and it should include the following information:The name and address of the seller(s).
The name and address of the buyer(s).
Information on the car being bought/sold, including the make, model, body type, year and VIN number.
List any additional items that the sale includes, if applicable, such as snow tires.
The current odometer reading.
The full purchase price.
A warranty from the seller stating that he or she is the legal owner and that the vehicle is free from all liens or encumbrances.
Whether the vehicle has been inspected by a mechanic prior to purchase.
Information identifying the condition of the vehicle and whether it is being sold “as is.”
Identify whether the vehicle was a salvage vehicle, deemed a total loss by an insurance company, or whether the vehicle was repaired under “lemon law.”
Identify any additional terms of sale.
Signatures by all parties to the sale of the car in front of a notary., In addition to the bill of sale, you should purchase the car with a check or bank check where you can demonstrate that you paid the funds to the seller., If you were able to assist the seller in replacing a lost title or having a previous owner transfer title to the seller, you should make sure that the seller transfers the title to you when you are exchanging payment for the car.

, Some states, such as New York, will allow you to register your vehicle with the state without the title. After completing your state’s required paperwork, the state may issue you a non-transferable registration, which means that the car is registered in the state, that you can use the car but that you cannot sell it to another person.To locate registration requirements in your state visit: http://www.dmv.org/car-registration.php

Get a cosigner.,
Research auto loan rates.,
Shop for your loan before you shop for a car.",How to Buy a Car With No Money Down and Bad Credit1," If you already have an account at a credit union, it is a good idea to inquire there about loans first. Credit unions are generally more lenient with their qualification requirements than other banks, especially in regards to their members. If you are not a credit union member, join a credit union and ask about auto financing for problematic credit.In order to open a credit union account, you will need a government issued I.D. and a minimum deposit. This amount will vary by credit union, but may be as low as $25.
Once your account is open, speak to a loan representative about auto financing options.
They will likely be able to tell you that same day whether or not you are approved and for what amount.
Bring your loan approval letter to the car dealership, who will deal directly with the credit union.;
, Find an auto dealership that specializes in used cars and bad credit financing. These are often referred to as ""buy here pay here"" lots. This type of dealership may approve a car loan for you with little to no money down, but be prepared to pay a high interest rate.


Many of these dealerships can approve you over the phone. They can also sit down with you in person.
You will need to verify your identity by providing a social security number, birth date, and other information (such as previous addresses).
It is a good idea to call and see if you are approved before you begin shopping for cars.

, An Internet search will return numerous sub-prime lenders, and you can often fill out an application online and have an answer within minutes. Once again, be prepared to pay a high interest rate.You will need to provide identifying information such as your social security number, birth date, and previous addresses.
You should be able to apply for a loan and be approved within 20 minutes.
Bring your loan approval letter to the car dealership, who will deal directly with the sub-prime lender.

, If you are not approved for the car loan on your own, another option is to get a family member or friend to co-sign. This means that the lender (the credit union, dealership, or other lender) will consider that person’s credit score alongside your own. This can be a good way to get a loan, and as you make payments, improve your credit score.


This can be done through almost any lender (credit union, dealership, or sub-prime).
If you are not approved for a loan through any or all of these channels, speak to them about getting a co-signer.
You will then need to discuss this with your family member or friend.
You co-signer will either need to appear in person to sign the paperwork, or submit identifying information online and signatures.

, Knowing the most common loan rates will help you avoid getting blindsided by someone wanting to charge you an interest rate that is too high. Do some basic internet searches to determine the going interest rates for different types of auto loans, and use this information to bargain with your lender.These rates vary by location and change regularly.
Perform an online search for ""average car loan rates in .""
Typically, loans spread over a longer period of time may have lower interest rates. However, as you will paying the loan back for longer, the interest will add up over time.

, Before you begin to look at cars, work on getting approved for a loan. Once you know the amount you have been approved for, shop for cars that fit this budget. You don’t want to fall in love with a car on the lot only to find out you can’t afford it."

Remain at the same address for at least one year.,
Maintain steady employment.,
Open a bank account.,
Obtain a phone in your name.",How to Buy a Car With No Money Down and Bad Credit2," Even lenders specializing in bad credit lending want to see that their clients are reliable. One way to demonstrate this is to reside at the same residence for one year or longer. If your credit report shows an endless string of addresses, this does not bode well for your reliability., Having steady employment and an income that can be verified is a crucial component to receiving a car loan. For some dealerships and sub-prime lenders, having a steady, verifiable source of income is the only factor that decides whether or not you will get a loan. If you are not employed, work to rectify this before seeking a car loan.Your verified employment can be shown through a paycheck stub, W-2, or 1099.
Know the address and phone number of your employer, as well as the name of someone a lender can call to verify your employment.

, Yet another way to show that are an established and responsible adult is to maintain a bank account. You may be asked to provide information about your bank account to potential lenders, either to show your balance in savings, or to provide a location for loan money to be deposited. Not only does the absence of a bank account make you look bad, it may disqualify you for a loan.Visit a local bank and speak to a representative about checking and/or savings accounts.
The minimum deposit to open an account will vary by bank and type of account. In some instances, it may be as low as $20.

, When you apply for a loan, your lender may need to contact you. This will only be possible if you have a phone. Not having a phone makes it difficult for them to communicate to you, but furthermore makes you look irresponsible. Visit a telephone provider in your area and discuss phones plans (including prepaid options) that fit your budget.

Learn your credit score.,
Evaluate your credit score.,
Dispute inaccuracies.,
Pay off small balances.,
Optimize your ""debt utilization."",
Obtain at least one major credit card.",How to Buy a Car With No Money Down and Bad Credit3," Go online and request credit reports from each of the three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian). Learning your credit score and seeing what positive and negative items are listed on your credit report will help you to see where you stand.

, If you have a credit score of 680 or higher, you will most likely get the best interest rate loans available. Scores between 550 and 680 are considered sub-prime. If you have a sub-prime score, you may pay higher interest rates. If you have a credit score of 550 and below, it may be difficult to obtain a car loan. If your score is below 550, you may want to work on improving this score before trying to purchase a car., Double-check your credit report for accuracy. It is not unusual for these agencies to make mistakes. Sometimes improving your credit is as painless as disputing inaccuracies on your credit report.

, If there are any small, unpaid balances on your credit report, pay these off. Paying off small amounts so that they are no longer listed as “unpaid” on your credit report can work to improve your credit rating, and display good faith to potential car lenders.Often, collection agencies will take a smaller settlement than what is owed, so try to negotiate.

, About 30% of your credit score is determined by your ""debt utilization,"" that is, how much of your available credit has been used. For example, if you have a credit card with a $15,000 limit, and you have only used $3000 of it, this will help your credit score. You can optimize your debt utilization by either paying down some of your balances, or increasing your credit limits.If you have recently gotten a raise or paid off some debts, you may by eligible for an increase in your credit limits. Contact your credit card company for details.

, Being approved for a major credit card (like a Visa or Mastercard) can help your credit score improve. This may be difficult if you have bad credit, but you can work toward it by opening a less prestigious credit account and making all your payments on time. After a while, you can apply for that Visa or Mastercard again."

Know the difference between a dealer-only wholesale auction and a public, repossession or other retail auction.,
Decide which car you want, the options you need, and the condition for which you are willing to settle.,
Use an independent source to determine the wholesale and retail values of your target vehicle.,
Settle on a budget.,
Decide that you will not exceed this budget under any circumstances; a key aspect of buying a car like a dealer is not to let emotions cause you to spend more than you decided to.

,
Get access to wholesale auctions using one of these methods:


Locate, research and retain a proxy buyer or proxy dealer who has access to wholesale auctions.,
Research local auctions to find out times, locations and get a list of available vehicles.,
Make any necessary financial arrangements.,
Stay in close contact with your proxy buyer while locating the car you want through purchase and delivery.

",How to Buy a Car Like a Dealer,"


A dealer-only auction requires a car dealer license in all 50 states and is the main way dealerships rotate excess inventory. Unlike public auctions dealer-only auctions tend to offer close to new cars, new cars, recent trade-ins or just off-lease vehicles. In addition, many vehicles are detailed, have existing warranties and are carefully rated as to condition.






Public car auctions are open to anybody, including savvy dealers, so the prices may not be as low as the hype suggests. You see these advertised all over the place including online and in the backs of newspapers.;
, Be as flexible as you can as you will be buying at auction.

, The most frequently used sources for this are, DriverSide, Edmunds, Kelly Blue Book and Nadaguides. NADAguides is owned by the Automobile Dealers Associations so their pricing is always most favorable to the dealer - not the consumer.

, Do not forget that your final price will include taxes, registration and other fees. Also consider ongoing costs - sites like DriverSide will help you estimate cost of ownership.

,, A proxy buyer is an individual (sometimes a group) who has a legal dealer license and runs a service where he or she attends wholesale auctions to buy an individual car for you.
Acquire a dealer license. This is typically a time-consuming and expensive process that is not practical unless you plan to buy and sell cars as a business. States rely on taxing dealerships for income, so there is little or no incentive for a state to grant a license to an individual who does not plan to operate as a car dealer.

, Once you have found one that has the vehicle you want, make arrangements to attend the auction or have your proxy buyer attend the auction.

, Each auto auction will have its own terms; verify these in advance make sure that you have the correct payment options available if you win the car.

Start out by shopping around, perhaps for a used car, that will be cheaper. If you can afford to pay cash, then you won’t need to worry about financing.;
, If you need a car loan, understand that different banks or credit unions have different requirements regarding prior credit history. You will want to shop around and ask. It is possible to get a loan as a foreigner. Just be prepared that you may need to pay a bit higher interest rate.

, There may be shipping restrictions across borders by the lender while debt is owed. In addition, if you're planning to take the car out of the United States, foreign countries may lack repair facilities for your vehicle or require engine modifications before you can legally drive.

, Before you move to the United States, begin researching ""expat car leasing and financing companies."" You will find a variety of companies, like 24Expat,Expatride,International AutoSource,and many others. These companies offer financing and leasing rates to expats at competitive local prices. If possible, contact a company before you move to the US to take advantage of special offers and savings.

, Many buyers may not realize that banks are not the only lenders. Most new car dealers will also handle their own financing. In some cases, if you finance your car purchase through the dealer, you may be able to get a better rate than you could get at a bank or other finance company. Research the conventional lenders first, and then keep these numbers in mind when you are shopping for cars., Work with the expat car service to get a better understanding of which of these options work best with your visa length and planned stay time in the country.

, In order to drive in the United States, you will need a recognized form of driver's identification. If you have a foreign license written in English, you can use this license as a visitor or for a time after you become a resident (the specific time varies by state). However, if your license is in another language, you will have to get an International Driving License (IDL) from your home country before you visit the U.S. If you plan to immigrate, you will need to exchange your foreign license for a U.S. one within a certain amount of time. Residents of the following countries may do so easily through reciprocity agreements:


Canada.
France.
Germany.
South Korea., In most of the U.S., you are required to have car insurance in order to drive. Before you are able to drive your new car away from the dealership, you will have to show proof that you are insured.New Hampshire is the only state that does not require car insurance,but even they highly recommend it., Although generally we say that every state requires you to have automotive liability insurance, the minimum requirements are different from state to state. In addition, lenders will usually require comprehensive and collision insurance for new cars. You will need to identify the requirements for the state where you intend to buy and register your car., Shop around, before you come to the U.S. or after you arrive, to find the best rates. Your expat car service should be able to help you secure auto insurance at an affordable rate., When buying a car, you will want to consider such things as the size (how many people are in your family?), the distance you will need to travel, and whether good gas mileage is important to you.

, Take the time to research and become familiar with your vehicle options. Available manufacturers in the U.S. may differ from your home country. Consider asking your expat car service representative questions about the available vehicles.

, In the U.S., prices for most items are set by the merchant and are not negotiable. Cars are different. Cars are listed with a “sticker price” (that is the price on the sticker posted in the car’s window). Most dealers, however, expect that you will make an offer that may be a few thousand dollars less than the sticker price. For a used car, there is usually even more room for negotiation. Some keys to good negotiation include:Research the car you want before you begin negotiating. After you have completed your shopping and you believe you have found the car you want, research it thoroughly. Using online sources like KellyBlueBook.com or Edmunds.com, you can look up the values of both new and used cars. These will give you a starting place for your negotiating.
Have a target price in mind. Before you begin the process, you should know what you want to pay, and then a higher amount that you might be willing to pay.
Use leverage to your advantage. When you are negotiating a price for a car, let the salesman believe that you are willing to walk away and go buy a different car from someone else. If they know they might lose your business, they may be willing to lower the price.
Focus on the car’s price, not the monthly payments. Many car salesmen will try negotiating the price in terms of monthly payments, rather than the total. If you do this, you run the risk of adding thousands of dollars to the price without really noticing it. Keep the conversation focused on the total price., Almost all professional car dealerships, whether you are buying a new or a used car, will do the work of registering a car and getting the license plates for it., Each state has a Department of Motor Vehicles (or it may be referred as Department of Transportation, Registry of Motor Vehicles, or some other similar name). If you are handling the registration yourself, you will need to contact this office or review its web site and find out their specific requirements for car registration.


A handy site with contact information for all 50 states is DMV.org.

, In most states, before you can register your car, you will need to get the following pieces of information:A registration application, which you can usually download from your state’s DMV web site.
The title for the new car, showing your name as the owner. A lien might be on title if it has been financed.
Proof of a satisfactory vehicle inspection. In most states, every car must pass a safety inspection in order to be registered. Some states also require an emissions or pollution test as well. You will need to take the car to a licensed mechanic or testing center to get inspected.

If you have not registered the car yet, you will not be able to drive it to the inspection location. If you are buying a used car, you will probably drive the car with the seller’s license plates to the inspection site, and then you will be able to get your own registration.


Proof of insurance.
Payment for sales tax and other registration fees. Check with the DMV web site in your state to determine what this will be. It varies from state to state.

, If, after you are through in the U.S., you choose to return home with your American-bought car, there are essentially three different choices for shipping. They vary based on time, cost, and security.Roll On, Roll Off (RORO): Vehicles are driven directly onto a ship and are lashed down. The travel time across the ocean (from the east coast to Europe, or from the west coast to Asia) is approximately two weeks. The cost is reasonable, but there is a risk of damage or theft.
Containerized Shipping: About six cars at a time are loaded into a closed, locked container, which is then loaded onto a ship. This is a more expensive alternative but provides added security than the RORO method.
Air freight: This is the most secure and fastest method of shipping your car. It is also the most expensive.

, You will need to show the title that you received when you purchased the car, showing your name as the vehicle's owner, in order to go through Customs. If you purchased the car at an auction (primarily for dealers), you would need the auction gate release and a report from the DMV showing that the title is clear., Many shipping companies recommend that you remove any personal property from inside the car before shipping it. At least one source suggests that you protect your car seats and dashboard with plastic sheeting.You also need to deliver the car to the shipper with as little gas left in the tank as possible., Before shipping take these items off the car. Make sure that you have the title and registration, along with any other private information or personal identifying paperwork, with you before you leave the car with the shipping company. Take these materials with you then when you pick up your car at your destination."

Singaporean car dealers feature most international makes and models, both new and used. Browse newspaper ads and online listings to get an idea for your potential car's price tag.;
, Keep in mind that the Singaporean government has put into place a variety of taxes and fees to discourage vehicle ownership that make it significantly more expensive compared to other countries. For example, a typical sedan in Singapore often ends up costing more than the average price of a home in the United States.There are quite a few costs to take into consideration in addition to the market price of your potential car:


The current cost of a COE for a car averages from between S$50,000 to S$70,000.
You will also need to pay a road tax each year. The exact cost will be determined by your vehicle's specifications, but expect around at least S$700. If you buy from a dealer, the first year is typically included in the price.
Other taxes and administrative fees add up. You will need to pay a flat registration fee of S$140 along with an Additional Registration Fee that will usually exceed the open market value of the vehicle itself. You will also be charged an Excise Duty equal to 20% of your car's open market value.Finally, there will be a 7% Goods & Services applied to the open market value plus its Excise Duty.Because space is at a premium, most Singaporeans must also pay to park their cars at home and work. A typical month of parking costs $180., Financing a car is largely identical to financing in another country. If you aren't paying for your vehicle in cash, you will have the option to take out either a dealer loan or a third party loan. However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore does place certain restrictions on car loans:


Creditors are limited by the amount they can lend to a single person in the form of a motor vehicle loan. They cannot lend more than the ""Relevant Amount"" of a vehicle. This amount is generally the cost of buying a car including interest.
You may obtain multiple loans from different creditors, but they cannot exceed the Relevant Amount when combined.
Loan tenure for motor vehicles cannot exceed 5 years., Read through the Land Transport Authority's COE Open Bidding Demonstration Kit & User Guide for the most up-to-date information.. Ask anyone you know who has recently successfully won a bid for a COE what to expect.


Open bidding periods are usually run beginning at noon on the first and third Mondays of each month and end at 4 pm the following Wednesday. If a public holiday falls during one of these periods, bidding will be extended.
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will release an announcement before each bidding period that will include the number of COEs being released and the exact start and end times for the bidding exercise., There are five different categories of COE: A, B, C, D, and E. Every bidding period will have a separate quota of COEs available for each category.


Category A: Passenger vehicles with an engine capacity of 1600cc and below.
Category B: Passenger vehicles with an engine capacity above 1600cc.
Category C: Buses and vehicles transporting goods.
Category D: Motorcycles.
Category E: A special category that includes all the vehicle types described in Categories A-D. This category is usually the most expensive type.However, if you choose to register a motorcycle with a Category E COE, you will only need to pay one third of the quota premium., You will need a bank account with either DBS Bank (or its subsidiary POSB) or OCBC Bank. If you are bidding on behalf of a company, you will need an account with UOB. This account must contain at least enough money for the fixed bid deposit, which is S$200 for a Category D and S$10,000 for all others., Check the current number of bidders and their reserves. Submit your initial reserve price. The minimum reserve price is S$1, but in reality most categories will end up in the high tens of thousands range.


DBS/POSB customers must place their bids through DBS/POSB ATMs. OCBC users can do so through phone banking. Individuals using UOB will submit through an Internet banking system.If you find the bidding process to be a headache, car dealers offer a variety of packages where the COE is included in the car's list price. Just keep in mind that COEs obtained through this method are often more expensive., Once you've successfully submitted your bid, you can check its status through the LTA website, UOB Internet banking, or OCBC phone banking. Monitor how your bid stacks up against others.


Keep in mind that the final COE price will be one dollar more than the highest unsuccessful bid, not the actual reserve price set by the successful bidders., If you find that your reserve price has dipped below the current successful bid price, consider revising it. Of course, if the price has risen above where you are willing to pay, you can always wait until the next bidding exercise. Revisions can be made through all four previously discussed channels.


You may revise your bid as many times as you like. However, keep in mind that you may not revise your bid lower than its current amount and that each revision with incur an additional small administrative fee., You must pay the difference between the bid deposit and the final quota premium upon registration. Bids for Categories A, B, and D are valid for 6 months, while those for Categories C and E remain valid for only three months. If the full amount has not been paid by that time, the bid is no longer valid and you must forfeit your initial bid deposit., If after 10 years you still would like to hold onto your COE, you must renew it. For a 10 year renewal, you must pay the new current Prevailing Quota Premium, which is an average of the COE prices in the last 3 months. 5-year renewals are subject to half this price.Once a vehicle has been registered with a 5-year COE, it is no longer eligible for renewal with a 10-year COE., A trait common to car salespeople in most countries is that a major part of their job is to upsell the customer. In Singapore where costs related to purchasing a vehicle are extremely inflated, it is especially important to not let yourself get talked into an even pricier car with features you neither want nor need., If this is your first time buying a car in Singapore, do not revealing this to the salesperson either directly or indirectly. Commit as much information to memory regarding Singaporean car buying and ownership as possible.


If you plan on paying in cash, do not say so until after negotiating for the price you want. Most car salespeople in Singapore make their profits from loans. If you tell them you want to pay in cash in the beginning, they are not likely to give you a better deal than the list price., Buying a car is likely to be one of the biggest purchases you'll make in your lifetime. Visit multiple dealerships and compare prices. Test drive as many vehicles as you can. Make sure the car you're buying is the one you want to drive for the next few years. You don't want to spend so much time and money only to end up with buyer's remorse., Many car dealers around the world engage in underhanded practices to make a sale. Singapore is no different, and the stakes are higher.


Be aware of sales gimmicks. Some dealers may advertise a car at a great price to get you in the door. Then, they may claim that the advertised price was a mistake or that the particular car had already sold. While these scenarios may be genuine, be on guard if this happens to you.
Triple-check anything that is in writing. Make sure the price listed on purchasing and financing documents is the identical to what you verbally agreed upon.
Do not sign any ""blank hire purchase"" forms. If you sign a blank document, the dealer may tack on extra fees without your consent."

You probably shouldn’t choose a national sale unless you have a rare or classic car. A national sale will be more of a hassle.It might be difficult to meet the buyer, and you might not want to accept a check drawn on an out-of-state bank.;
, There are several websites that are dedicated to bringing buyers and sellers together. You should visit each website to compare and to check how other people advertise their cars. The following are some of the more common websites sellers use:


eBay Motors (local sales)
Craigslist (local sales)
Cars.com (national sales)
Kelley Blue Book (national sales)
Autotrader.com (national sales)

, Some websites will allow you to post an ad for free, whereas others may charge fees. You should research how much you must spend on advertisement before creating an account and posting on the website.


On eBay Motors, you can typically post an advertisement for free. However, you will pay a fee based on the listing price if the car sells. For example, if you successfully sell a vehicle for $2,000 or less, then you will pay $60.Craigslist allows you to post for free on the “for sale by owner” site. It allows you to sell within a certain geographic area.
Cars.com offers many different packages, and fees will vary depending on the package you choose. There is a free option.Autotrader.com also requires fees. For example, you can post three online photos for four weeks for $25.00. With an enhanced package, you can post nine photos for eight weeks at $50.Kelley Blue Book charges fees based on how long the ad runs and the number of photos you upload. Its fee structure is similar to Autotrader.com, since they are owned by the same company.

, Price is key. It’s ideal to ask for an amount that is a little high so that you can come down when you negotiate. Look to see what similar cars are selling for in your area. You should also check the car’s book value, using Kelley Blue Book or the NADA guide. You want to find the “retail value,” which will depend on the following factors:year
make and model
mileage
options

, Generally, you can leave the inspection to the buyer if you have a good idea of the car’s condition. However, there are a couple advantages to getting the car inspected yourself before listing it for sale:For example, the buyer might get the car inspected and find problems. If you disclosed any problems ahead of time, you built trust with the buyer.
Also, you won’t have to rely on the opinion of the buyer’s mechanic. You’ll have your own mechanic’s opinion about the value of the car. This can help in negotiations.

, You can increase your car’s value by making repairs. Some repairs won’t cost you much but can boost the selling price for your vehicle. Consider the following:Replace burnt out lights. These can be replaced easily and cheaply.
Remove dents. It only costs about $100 to remove a few dents from your car, but buyers will certainly notice.
Fix scratches. You can seal up scratches using home kits which are available for purchase at a hardware store.
Replace a cracked windshield. Although replacing the windshield isn’t necessarily cheap, potential buyers overestimate how much it will cost to replace one. Accordingly, they will try to lower the purchase price. Replace the window yourself and reap the benefits.

, Before taking pictures, you should wash and wax your car. Clean all windows and wipe the interior surfaces. Also vacuum the car to pull up all the dirt on the floors. If you can’t take the time to clean the car yourself, then use a professional detailer.If the seats are stained and you can’t get the stains out, then think of purchasing seat covers.
Take out any junk or stored items from the trunk. Ideally, you should have an empty trunk to show the potential buyer.

, Vivid color photographs can make your car worth every penny that you advertise it for. Park your car in front of a neutral background, so that the viewer will focus on the car. You can park in front of a brick wall or a garage, for example. Then take photographs from a variety of angles. Make sure to photograph the following:exterior
interior
trunk
engine
wheels
tires

, You want to write a short, accurate description. If it is too long, then no one will read it and they probably won’t buy your car. Make sure to include the following information in your description:The car’s details (make, model, year, etc.), including mileage. Be accurate about mileage, because a buyer will double check.
Any accidents and recent repairs.
The car’s overall general condition.
Whether you have modified the car.
The asking price. Realize that some buyers want to negotiate, so you could list a price slightly higher than what you are willing to settle for.
Your contact information. You want people to be able to reach you, so give an email address if you don’t answer your phone often.

, After you choose an online website to advertise on, you should create an online account and upload your description and pictures. If you need to pay a fee, then you can typically pay with a credit card or debit card.

, If someone contacts you about the car, then make sure to respond quickly. Don’t wait more than 48 hours. A day is preferable. When you call, make sure to gather important information:the potential buyer’s name
their contact information (phone, email)
where they live

, To protect yourself from scammers, you should ask questions when you respond to any query. For example, you should ask the caller whether they have financing already lined up.If they say no, then be on your guard.


Also ask what the buyer’s needs are. They might not have read your ad carefully and want something your car doesn’t have.
Always be careful of anyone who wants to buy the vehicle without looking at it first.

, You should ask the potential buyer if they want to test drive the vehicle.When scheduling a test drive, remember the following tips:Agree to meet during the day at a public location, such as a mall or a bank. You don’t know the other person and shouldn’t meet a stranger in an isolated part of town. Also make sure your route is in a populated area so there will be other drivers on the road. You should insist on going along for the test drive.
Ask another person to go along with you so you aren’t alone in the car with a stranger.
Make sure that your car insurance covers other drivers.

, With luck, the potential buyer will agree to your advertised price. If not, you can negotiate. Hopefully, you left some room in your advertised price so that you can come down. Remember that you don’t have to sell the car. Only accept a price that you are comfortable with.


If someone makes a low offer, ask them to give you reasons why. Someone negotiating in good faith should have reasons for their offer. If they can’t give a reason, then they may not be a serious buyer.
Never go down all the way to the buyer’s offer. For example, you might have advertised a car for $10,000. The buyer offers $8,000. Go down only in $500 increments.

, States have different requirements for how to transfer a car. In many states, you must draft a bill of sale and a release of liability when transferring a car. You should check with your state’s DMV.


The bill of sale document records the transaction, and usually includes information about the vehicle, the buyer and seller, and the purchase price.Your state’s DMV office might have a sample bill of sale you can use. Alternately, you can draft your own.
You should also file a release of liability with your motor vehicles office. This release protects you in case the buyer doesn’t change the car title to their name. There should be a form you can pick up from your state’s DMV office., The buyer might want to see all service records on the car. You should go through these documents first and black out any personal information. You can use a thick black sharpie marker. You should remove the following:credit card numbers
prior addresses
any phone numbers the buyer doesn’t know about
your Social Security Number

, Once you and the buyer settle on a price, you need to make sure that you receive safe payment. There are many people out there trying to trick you, so you should do the following to protect yourself:Don’t accept any check for more than the sale price. Often, this is a scheme to get you to refund the surplus. Only later do you discover the entire check is fraudulent.
Be wary of using an escrow service. An escrow will hold a check and then release it to you when you deliver the car. However, the escrow could be fraudulent. If the buyer wants to use an escrow service, then thoroughly research the company. Better yet, don’t use an escrow.
Check whether a personal check is fraudulent. You can visit http://www.fakechecks.org/ to check whether a check is legitimate. This website was created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
If possible, get cash. You can also accept a cashier’s check, which you validate at the buyer’s bank.

, In most states, you need to transfer the car by filling out your certificate of title. Check with your state’s motor vehicles office. Generally, you need to complete and sign the back side of the Certificate of Title and hand it over to the buyer along with a bill of sale.


You should keep copies of the title and bill of sale for your records., Depending on your state, you may have to turn in your license plates to the DMV. At the same time, you can cancel your registration. The new owner must then register the vehicle in their own name.Also remember to cancel the insurance on your car. Contact your insurance agent.

Finalize the sale.",How to Sell Your Used Car," Your car's make and model are easy to determine by simply looking at the exterior. However, to properly value your car you will also need the name of its trim package and any optional features present on the car. You'll want to consult the documents provided to you by the dealer, like the original window sticker, to get this information. Make sure to also record the current mileage.For example, you wouldn't advertise your 2008 Audi A4 as simply that, but as a 2008 Audi A4 Quattro Premium Plus 2.0 liter Turbo with navigation system, S Sport package, and alloy wheels. Being specific will not only help you sell the car but can also help you price it appropriately.
Be sure to update your car's mileage if you continue to drive it while it is on the market.;
, Take an honest look at your vehicle. Is it really like new? Chances are, if you've owned the car for any significant length of time, it shows some wear. Be frank with yourself and make an assessment of your car's actual condition. Rank it in one of the general categories: like new, very good, good, poor, or very poor. This conditional ranking is also relative to similar cars of the same age, so look around online at comparable cars and how they are listed to get a better idea of your car's true condition.You may also want to get an inspection of your vehicle at a local service center. They can tell you any issues with the car and give you an experienced opinion on its condition., Kelly Blue Book (KBB), NADA Guides, and Edmunds are the major online organizations that provide an accurate assessment of your car's value based on your location, vehicle condition, vehicle model, and model year. Go to these websites and enter your information to get a report on your car's estimated value. Input as much information as possible to get an accurate estimate. Then, use this number as a starting point for pricing your car., Go online to websites like Cars.com, Autotrader, and Craigslist to search for vehicles similar to yours being sold in your area. This will give you an idea of any regional pricing differences your car may experience. Compare the numbers you find to your estimated KBB or NADA value. Make sure you're looking at cars with similar options and mileage, not just year and model., Check for any maintenance receipts for the car you have kept. Gather these in the same place to make a record of the car's maintenance that you can show to potential buyers. If they see that you have maintained the car properly and regularly, doing things like changing the oil frequently, they will know that the car is in good condition.If you visited the same auto service center for service over the years, see if they can print out a record of your visits.Alternately, you can use a service like CarFax or AutoCheck to get your car's vehicle history report. This requires your VIN number and also a fee of about $30 or $40., The actual price you set for your car depends on a number of variables. Start with your estimated KBB or NADA valued and adjust this up or down for the comparable cars you found online. Add a cushion on top of this price if you want to negotiate the price back down with your buyers. Alternately, you can price it lower than you think it's really worth if you want to make a quick sale.


You can price your car higher if it is in exceptional shape for its age, has been cared for very well, or has had major parts replaced recently.
Price your car lower if it has significant accident damage or is in need of repair., Make the car look like a car you would want to buy. Unless your car is very cheap, it may be wise to spend up to $100 to have your car professionally detailed. You will likely get this money back when your buyer is willing to pay more for your now cleaner looking car. If you choose to clean it yourself, make sure to clean every part of the car, including:


Washing and waxing the exterior.
Washing wheels and tires and treating them with specialized tire and wheel shine.
Washing any cloth seats or floor mats.
Vacuuming every part of the interior.
Cleaning out the ashtrays.
Washing all the windows.
Applying leather cleaner to leather seats and steering wheel., No one wants to buy a car that needs to be repaired immediately. To sell your car more quickly and gain the ability to charge a higher price, consider fixing small problems with your car. Look around for small paint chips, dings, dents, and windshield cracks or chips. Repair any chips in the windshield if it is damaged, or replace it if that won't do the trick. Hire a specialist to take out the dents and dings in the body. By repairing these problems now, you avoid the issue where a buyer tries to talk your price down due to cost of repairs. The idea here is that you spend money now to get more back from you car when it sells., Always have your car's oil freshly changed and fluid levels checked before trying to sell it. This is a relatively cheap way to prepare your vehicle for sale.

, Some small replacements can make a huge difference in how your car looks and is viewed by potential buyers. For example, if you have cracked light lenses on your car, you should replace them. This dramatically improves the appearance of your vehicle. In addition, if your tires or brakes are noticeably in bad condition, think about replacing these as well. They may be expensive, but it could make thousands of dollars in difference in the sale price of the car.You can also get the light lenses polished to like-new condition for about $50. This is cheaper than replacing them.

, This is more up to your discretion, but consider removing any modifications you have made to personalize your vehicle. For example, you may have added a spoiler and replaced your headlights with LED lights. These changes may hurt or improve your odds of getting a good price for your vehicle, depending on the buyer. The best thing to do if you are unsure of whether or not it will help your sale is to remove them and return the vehicle to stock condition., To sell your vehicle privately, you will need all of the necessary documentation to comply with DMV requirements. Relevant documents include anything that deals with the ownership or condition of the vehicle. You may also have to create certain documents under DMV guidelines. Check with your local DMV office if you are unsure of what documents you need or where to get them. In general, you will need:


The vehicle's title.
Maintenance records.
A Bill of Sale.
A Release of Liability.
Warranty documents (if your vehicle is still under warranty).
As-is documentation., After your car has been cleaned and you've made any replacements or repairs, pick a sunny day to take some pictures of your car. If you have a real camera, use it, but odds are your smartphone will do just fine. You'll want level, clear pictures of multiple sides of your car's exterior and interior. Some shots to focus on include:


The exterior front, back, and sides.
The interior front and back seats, trunk, dashboards, and floor mats.
Wheels and tires.
Under the hood., You can do this in Microsoft Word, Publisher, or any other similar program. Add a couple of the best pictures of the car at the top. List how to contact you and basic information like the asking price, model, model year, mileage, and any features or attractive attributes. You may also wish to include the vehicles VIN number, condition, maintenance history, number of owners, or accident history.Put tabs at the bottom of the ad with your phone number so people can rip them off and contact you.
Include why you are selling the car.
State whether or not the price is final, negotiable, or open to offers., Post your ad online. Be sure to add all of your pictures as well. You can post this ad on many different websites, from car-specific sites, like eBay Motors and Cars.com, to more generalized sites, like Craigslist and Facebook. Make sure to include contact information, such as a phone number or email address.


Car-specific sites like Autotrader, eBay Motors, and Cars.com will help you reach a much larger audience than Facebook or Craigslist. These should be your first choice for selling rarer or higher-value cars.
Alternately, Craigslist and Facebook will allow you keep your audience mostly in your area, allowing for easier meet ups with potential buyers. They're also usually better sites for posting lower value or heavily used cars.
You can look for local Facebook ""yard sale"" groups and post your ad there.Post the ad on your own website if you have one.

, Tell your friends, co-workers, and relatives that you're selling your car. Maybe they would like to buy it or know someone searching for a car. You can also create a posting on Facebook for your car and then ask friends to share the link to their networks.

, You can then continue to drive the car or leave it on your property within view of the road so that passers-by can see it. Make sure to include contact information, like a phone number, on the sign.

, Pitch your vehicle's advantages and downplay any problems. Try to tell a story that justifies your car's price. Negotiate a price that you can both agree on. It may be a good idea to determine the smallest value you'd accept for the car and stick to that price.Start with a higher price than what you would realistically be willing to take for the car (maybe 20 to 30 percent more) and negotiate down from there if needed.
Read how to negotiate if you're unfamiliar with negotiation tactics.

, Most of the time, buyers will want to drive the car themselves before buying. You can reduce the risk of something going wrong by following some simple guidelines. First, always ask the buyer to bring a photocopy of their driver's license. If they don't, ask to see it and write down their driver's license number, address, and phone number. Next, be clear about how long you are allowing them to test drive the car for. Also, make sure to always accompany the buyer on the test drive.You may want to check your insurance coverage before allowing test drives. Most policies cover accidents when another driver is driving your vehicle, but some do not., Follow safety guidelines when meeting and exchanging money and documents with buyers. To avoid fraud, ask for the potential buyer's full name upfront. You should also clarify the types of payment you will accept. It's usually a good idea to avoid money orders and personal checks, and you should never accept monthly repayment offers (there's no guarantee the buyer will continue to pay you).When arranging a meeting, make sure you meet in a public place within view of security cameras, if possible.
If you decide to accept a personal check, meet the buyer outside of their bank and don't hand over the keys until you've gone inside and confirmed that they have the funds to pay for the car.
It's safest and easiest to simply accept cash for the vehicle.

, To actually sell the car, you will have to fill out the proper documentation with the buyer and the DMV. Start by completing the Bill of Sale with the buyer's information and the date. Then, sign over the title to the car after receiving payment. Submit any additional paperwork your state requires, like a release of liability. Give your buyer maintenance records (with your personal info blacked out) and warranty documents if you have them. Finally, remove your vehicle from your insurance."

Sedans, which are great family cars with typically good fuel efficiency, are generally in high demand year-round.
Convertibles and high performance cars see best sales in summer months. It might be difficult for you to sell one of these in fall or winter.
Trucks and vans sell very competitively, as these are useful work vehicles. You should not underestimate the value of these.
Collectible cars can take a long time for you to find the right buyer for an acceptable price.;
, You should begin accumulating the paperwork you'll need to finalize the sale of your car before even putting your car on the market. Your car might sell in months or days, but you will not be able to legally transfer ownership of your car without the proper documentation. Each state has different requirements for documenting an auto-sale, but generally, you'll need:



Title: you will need to sign the title, showing that you acknowledge the transfer of ownership, and give this document to the new owner after the sale.

Maintenance records: these will show you have been diligent in the upkeep of your car, and will increase its value. If you have misplaced your maintenance records, the shop where your car was serviced will likely have these on file.

Bill of sale: this document specifies the terms and conditions of the sale, and in the event of a dispute, can release you from certain legal obligations related to liability.

Release of liability: without this form, you could be held accountable for damages or accidents that occur before the vehicle is registered under the new owner.

Warranty documents: these documents should be given to the new owner upon sale of the car (if it is still covered by a warranty), as these transfer to the new owner with the sale of the vehicle.

As-is documentation: especially if there are no warranties, you'll want it to be outlined clearly that any responsibility for repair or damage once the vehicle is sold is that of the new owner. This can be included in the bill of sale., This is especially important if you have a limited knowledge of automobiles. Owners have a tendency to overestimate the value of their vehicle, and this can cause trouble or leave you feeling like you're being ripped off when you're trying to sell your car.A pre-sale inspection means that you won't have any nasty surprises if a potential buyer spots something wrong with the vehicle.
You'll be able to contest possibly false claims made by buyers who want to unethically drive the price of the sale down.
Potential buyers will know you are serious about the fair sale of the car, improving trust and putting them at ease., There are many resources available online for determining the worth of your car, but keep in mind conditions brought to your attention in you pre-sale inspection. A few small repairs before you put your car on the market can significantly increase your asking price.Some websites that can help you determine the worth of your car are:


Kelly Blue Book car value calculator:http://www.kbb.com/whats-my-car-worth/

National Appraisal Guide car value calculator:http://www.nadaguides.com/

Autotrader car value calculator:http://www.autotrader.com/car-values/, There are many websites, both pay- and free-to-use, that offer vehicle listings to prospective buyers. Be aware that general listings will have a wide audience, and you may have to screen several buyers until you find the right one for the sale. If you live on a well traveled road, you might consider putting your car in front of your home with a ""For Sale"" sign.Don't forget about using social media to your advantage. You never know when a relative, friend, or friend of a friend will be in need of new transportation.
You can also look into peer-to-peer car selling websites. These will each have particular conditions that you'll have to look into before deciding on whether or not this is the right venue, but sites like Beepi, Carvana, and Zipflip could connect you with the next owner of your car., At minimum, you should clean all surfaces of your vehicle, vacuum it, wash the exterior, and remove any garbage or crud that might have accumulated over the course of your ownership. If this sounds unappealing, you can always take your car to be detailed by a professional., These fixtures are frequently affordable to replace and will be among the things buyers are on the lookout for. Most auto supply stores will have the parts you need in stock, and most fixes will require little more than a Phillips screwdriver., Though you might think a small crack or chip inconsequential, these are hard to miss for new buyers inspecting the car for the first time. And when that new buyer notices this defect, he'll likely try to bargain you down from your asking price far below what the repair would cost you.A dealership might knock off as much as $800 for a ""new windshield,"" as this might be the factory cost, whereas your insurance might cover most, if not all, of the cost of this repair., Brakes are a tremendously strong selling point, and mentioning to interested parties that you've recently had the brakes replaced will up the value in their estimation. For most cars, this will only cost $100 to $150, and could serve you well in the bargaining phase., You might be able to get several dents in the body of your car repaired for around $100. A ""like new"" body will up the value of your car, and if the potential buyer doesn't see the ding, he won't be able to use it as ammunition in negotiations., Tires can be expensive, but making sure your tires are ideal for your sale can cost less than you might think. Buyers will check your car's tires for worn down or uneven tread. Replacing one or two trouble tires with matching used ones, which should average you around $30 - $40, can save you from a $300 - $700 deduction a buyer might request to offset the cost of new tires., If you need to sell your car on the fly to get money quick from the sale, you should consider pricing it lower than its rated value. Pricing low can also help your car sell if it has been in an accident or needs major work done to it. However, if your car is covered by warranty, you have recently done work on it, and/or you have maintained it well, don't hesitate to highball your asking price a bit.Most people expect to haggle a bit when buying a car privately. This being the case, you may only want to highball your asking price the amount that you are willing to be haggled down.

, Check out the range of prices for cars similar to yours in classified listings. This should help you establish a ballpark range for your asking value of your vehicle. Once you've taken into account this information, the amount of work you've put into your car, and and the condition of your car, you should have a good idea of what you want to set your price at., Quality pictures attract more buyers than a blurry cell phone shot. Take multiple pictures from different angles, being sure to get clear pictures of the front end, rear end, front interior, rear interior, wheels, and engine of the car. When taking your picture of your car engine, try to do so when there is good light, or have a friend hold a light so the condition of the engine can be clearly seen., Now that you have your car ready and a competitive asking price, you're ready to list your car. Let potential buyers know if the price is firm, or if you're willing to negotiate, usually indicated by the letters ""OBO"" which stands for “or best offer.""Letting buyers know that you're trying to get rid of your vehicle quick can also attract prospective buyers. You should also include:


Car mileage
The condition of your vehicle
A history of accidents or damage
Modifications or upgrades
Recent repairs
VIN (vehicle identification number)
Number of owners.

, If you're not a trained car salesperson, you may benefit from making a list of all the positive features of your vehicle, in addition to reasons why people might want to buy the car. Have specific figures at the ready, like fuel efficiency and odometer mileage., There is always the chance that your advertising might attract a less than savory individual. If you are a woman and feel uncomfortable meeting a stranger on your own, arrange to have a friend with you, or be sure friends or family know when you're going to have an appointment to show your car.If you feel uncomfortable at any point with an individual, do not hesitate to cancel the sale or come up with an excuse for not selling. Something as simple as, ""I'm sorry, another buyer offered a better price,"" can save you from being hassled.Be sure you offer your full name when screening and ask for the full name of the potential buyer.
Indicate in your communications the kinds of payment you find acceptable

, Under no condition should you allow a prospective buyer drive the car alone.You don't want a car thief to drive off with your car! Choose a public, safe place for you and the interested buyer to cruise around. Be as helpful and honest as possible throughout the test drive.


Before offering a test drive, make sure your insurance covers other drivers.
Try not to let yourself be outnumbered while in the car by a buyer and his or her friends.
Have your pre-sale inspection information at the ready, so that if the buyer asks to take the car to a mechanic before agreeing to the sale, you already have the information ready.

, After completing the test drive, you should re-state the asking price, how firm you are on that price, and any other significant features, like warranties, that might be alluring to a buyer. It can be helpful walking into a negotiation with a firm understanding of how much you're willing to budge the final sales price of your car. Whatever you do, don't allow yourself to be bullied., The requirements for transferring ownership of your car to the new buyer will be different for each state. When it comes to personally identifying information, which might be included on your maintenance reports, you will want to black out unnecessary details to prevent the possibility of identity theft. There may also be transfer paperwork required by your state that must be filed by the seller of the vehicle.Generally speaking, you'll need to:


Complete the bill of sale.
Sign over the title
Fill out the Release of Liability
Submit necessary forms to your state DMV
Provide warranty documents
Provide copies of maintenance records., But not before you verify the payment. If you've been paid by check, you'll want to be sure that the check doesn't bounce. Keys should only be given after payment has cleared, and following that, all you have to do is take off your license plate, remember to cancel your insurance, and get a ride home, if necessary.


Some states do not require you to remove the license plates for your vehicle after completing the sale."

Clean it inside and out, vacuum it, polish and fix minor flaws.As part of your preparations, have the car inspected by a mechanic and make any repairs that it needs. You should organize your maintenance records and have them available for potential buyers.;
, You need to describe the car, fully and honestly. You don’t need to mention every dent and ding, but you should describe the car in honest terms. After all, any serious buyer is going to see the car eventually anyway, and they will appreciate your honesty.Play up the car’s strengths in your ad. If you believe it has strong pickup, a big trunk, or anything else that buyers might want, say so.
Include plenty of photographs. Clear photographs of the car will draw buyers’ attention.
Include the basic details. Identify the make, model, year, mileage, color, and any special additions that the car may have.
Define the terms of the sale - the asking price and whatever forms of payment you will accept., There are several forms of effective advertising. To create the best chance of selling your car for a good price, you should make use of several different forms of advertising:Spread the word among your friends and colleagues.
Post fliers in public places that show positive photographs of your car.
Post your advertisement online at sources like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.
Use online car selling sites like autotrader.com and cars.com.
Focus on local advertising. The Oregonian newspaper has an online classifieds page, where you can post your ad.You can also post in The Nickel, a publication that serves northern Oregon and southern Washington.Call your own local newspaper as well.
Put a sign in the car’s windows and drive it around town. You may also find some public place to park it and display the window sign. If you do, make sure that you have the permission to park where you put it.

, Use a source like the Kelley Blue Book to get an estimate of your car’s value. The Kelley Blue Book has an online site at KBB.com. You enter your car’s make, model, year and condition, and you will receive a range for its value.Many people form emotional attachments to their cars. This may lead to an overestimation of the value. To avoid this, get an unbiased opinion from your mechanic about its condition., The Blue Book will give you a starting range, but you need to refine it. If you have kept up on the regular maintenance of the car or if your car is still under warranty, you may be able to set a price at the top of the range. If you are aware of flaws, then perhaps you should stick to the bottom of the range.In either case, when you are setting your asking price, you should leave a cushion of approximately 10% to account for negotiating. As an example, if you really want to collect $4,000 for the car, you should begin with an asking price of about $4,400-$4,500.

, When someone responds to your advertisements, you will first want to verify that they are genuinely interested. Remind them of the price and the form of payments (certified check or money order, for example). It is a good idea not to accept payments over time, as this may be a sign of fraud.


It is common for buyers to expect to test drive the car and even have it examined by a mechanic. You should plan to accompany the driver on the test drive and use the opportunity to talk about the car and try to make your sale., Although you may have accounted for some negotiating and the ability to lower your asking price, you should also have in mind a true bottom price. If the buyer is not willing to meet at least that, then you should be willing to walk away from the deal., In order to sell your car, you need the original title document. If you cannot find it or do not have it, you will need to get it from one of several sources.If you still owe money on the car, then the lender will have the title. You can only sell the car by first paying off your loan, and then you will get the title from your lender.The lender will complete a Statement of Lien Satisfaction, which you can get from the Oregon Department of Transportation or print at http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/524fill.pdf.
If you know that you had the title, but now you cannot find it, you will need to order a duplicate from the Oregon Department of Transportation. The Application for Replacement Title is available online at http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/515fill.pdf. Complete the form and submit it to the DMV with a fee of $77 for most vehicles. If you need help or have questions, call (503) 945-5000. In Portland, call (503) 299-9999.

, Everyone whose name appears on the front of the title as the owner must sign the title on the back as the seller. There is a space on the back of the title for the signatures of the sellers.


If one or more of the owners listed on the front of the title is not available, you must resolve that conflict before you can sell the car. If an owner has died, you will need to get a new title as a transfer through a will. If the original ownership has changed, the title must be revised to match. Any changes to the names on the title must be treated as a “sale” and must be registered with the DMV.

, Underneath the space for the seller(s) on the back of the title is a space for the buyer. Have the buyer sign in this space, using his or her full name as he or she wants it to appear on the new title., This is a requirement for most sales, and your signature verifies that the odometer reading is original.Odometer readings are not required for the sale of vehicles that do not have an odometer, that are over ten years old, that are not self-propelled (trailers or campers), or that weigh over 16,000 pounds. Odometer readings are not required for the sale of snowmobiles either. Additionally, if one of the sellers is going to remain on the title after the sale, the odometer reading is not required., A bill of sale is not required in Oregon to make a legal transfer of the car, but it is a good idea. A bill of sale identifies the car by year, make, model and vehicle identification number (VIN), and names both the buyer and the seller. A form for a bill of sale is available through the Department of Transportation website at http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/501fill.pdf.


The bill of sale has spaces for both the “Date of Purchase” and the “Date of Release.” These dates are the same. From the buyer’s point of view, the vehicle is being purchased. From the seller’s point of view, ownership is being “released.” Just repeat the same date.
Both the buyer and the seller should keep a copy of the bill of sale. This serves to formalize the deal.

, Once the sale has been marked completely on the title, you (the seller) must notify the Oregon DOT of the sale within ten days. You will submit the original title, with all the spaces filled in, along with a Notice of Sale or Transfer of a Vehicle (Form 735-6890).You need to provide this notice so the Department of Transportation will know that you are no longer responsible for the vehicle or anything that happens to it.


The buyer will be responsible for his own registration and insurance on the vehicle. This is not up to you as part of the sale. The buyer will complete an Application for Title and Registration form (Form 735-226), which is available from the Oregon DOT at http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/226fill.pdf. The buyer must submit this form within 30 days after the sale.

, When the vehicle is sold, you will need to do something with the license plates. You can either transfer them to the buyer along with the car, keep them yourself and transfer them to another car that you own, or destroy them. Instructions for each of these are as follows:To transfer the plates to the buyer, the buyer will need to mark the box for “Plate Transfer” when he or she completes the Application for Title and Registration form (Form 735-226). The buyer will need to pay an additional transfer fee to do this as well.
If you wish to transfer the plates to another vehicle, you will need to complete the Application for Registration, Renewal, Replacement or Transfer of Plates and/or Stickers (Form 735-268). You will be responsible for a license plate transfer fee of $6.
If you no longer wish to use the license plates, you can either destroy them by bending or cutting them so they are no longer usable or turn them in to the DMV at 1905 Lana Ave. NE, Salem, Oregon 97314. You can also return them at any DMV office.

"
Prepare your vehicle: Make sure the car is fully Valeted.,
Put your price slightly higher than what you expect—negotiate to get the deal that’s right for you.,
Purchase a ""hold until sold"" advertisement.,
Understand if your asking price is on the lower range you may park it at the nearest Walmart, or some shopping area where lot of people turn up.,
Do your sales-pitch when they phone.,
Do not let them test drive the car alone; they may not come back.,
Seal the deal.",How to Sell a Used Car," Without doubt it will add value to your sale. If it has not been serviced recently, you can get it done for about £100. Also re-MOT the car if it is due to expire in the next 3 months or less. Finally, a cheap pair of new hub caps are great value for money in making a car look good for sale. Go to a details shop and you may spent $90 to 100 to wax/shine up your car externally, and to wash/dry/polish it in the inside. Your tires will get a good wash too—and this will impress your potential customers. This investment will definitely be worth it—and you can incorporate this expense in your asking price (without telling the customer of course). Also, if there are minor blemishes (trunk broke/ handle broke)—fix those—it will be worth it. It will only take a minor fault to turn the buyer off.;
, If you are not in a hurry to sell the car, and think that you deserve a certain price—wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, because you will definitely find a buyer who will pay your price. Use an independent source to determine the wholesale and retail values of your target vehicle. The most frequently used sources for this are, DriverSide, Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book.

, There is no need to repay for advertising nowadays. Make your advert specific. Make sure you include the following: Price, specification-Make Model, and level of trim, Colour (best to include lots of nice photos), Service history, Tax and MOT, Mileage.


A free website like craigslist.com can serve as an extremely useful medium to spread the word about your car sale. Make sure you look at other people’s Ads too, and post your car’s pictures and description accordingly. Try Craigslist—you will definitely get lots of inquiries.

, Remember to ask people at those stores if this is okay—in some cases stores may tow your car.


Park your car so it is visible from the main road, and to more and more people visiting the store. If people are calling you asking about the car each day—it also means that your car is safe there! You don’t have to necessarily check it out everyday.
Put ‘for sale’ signs (also available at Walmart) on 3-4 sides of the car—so people approaching from all angles can view it.
You may or may not put the price on the ‘For Sale’ signs. A lot of buyers are skeptical about used cars—so you may just put your phone no., invite them to talk to you, do your sales pitch, and then announce the price.

, Explain the real reason for selling your car. Explain how many miles you have driven the car on your own, and explain your overall experience with the car. As an example this is what I used when I sold my ‘good’ condition Toyota Corolla 1996.


Potential Customer: “What is the price of the car?”
Me: “Let me first tell you more about the car…the only reason I am selling the car is because I got a full time job with XYZ (name your company if people know about it. People will trust you more because of your affiliation) and hence I bought a new car…I am a student from Virginia…went to school at Virginia Tech and I bought this car when I was in school. I have driven 21K miles on the car in the past 1.5 years and I have had no problems, whatsoever. I have made long trips of 600+ miles one way to Virginia—without being stranded on the road. The car runs great…has no mechanical problems…requires only regular service, as very good tires…and is just like any other solid Toyota car…why don’t you test drive the car and check it out for yourself. I don’t care if you want to take the car out to a mechanic, and verify for yourself. My asking price for the car is $$$$.

, If they want a professional inspection, don't panic, it means they are serious. When negotiating, never refuse to budge on the price, and don't let them walk away for the difference of £50-£100, it is not worth losing the sale over such a small amount.

, When someone has agreed to buy your car, make sure you print a Bill of Sale and get it signed by your buyer. Google ‘Bill of sale’ and you will find several websites which can print a Bill of Sale after you provide some information. Some sites may allow you to preview the created ‘Bill of Sale’, but may not let your ‘copy/paste’ or ‘print’ it. Just Printscreen and copy it to your word processor and print it.


Also, you will be asked to fill out the details on the back of the title—do that clearly.
Make sure the check is cleared, or that you have got the correct amount in hard cash, before you sign the title on the back.
Now, you can give the keys to the car.
Make sure you take off the license plates before and removable decals (related to your school, etc.) before you give away the car.

Close the deal.",How to Sell a Vehicle Online," Your title proves your ownership, as well as your right to transfer it. If you bought your vehicle outright from a dealer or private seller, you should have the title in your possession. But if you purchased your vehicle through a loan, the bank may have your title and you’ll need to contact them to find out whether, and on what terms, they will release it to you.If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of having lost your title, you will need to apply to the relevant government authority in your region or country for a replacement.;
, If your vehicle was purchased at a dealership or other commercial retailer, you should have received a sales receipt when you bought it. If it is also covered by an ongoing service warranty connected to your purchase, then having the original sales receipt is doubly useful.

, Several jurisdictions around the world require that vehicles, especially those past a certain age, are periodically tested to meet emissions or road worthiness standards. You will need to check with the relevant government authority in your region or country to see what, if any, such clearances are required and how they may be obtained if yours have expired.


In North America and Western Europe, garages and auto body shops are authorized to charge for and perform such tests and issue the relevant clearances when required. If you fail a required test, you will need to have maintenance work done on your vehicle to ensure that it can pass the test the next time around., Whether you’re the kind of diligent person who regularly takes their vehicle in for periodic maintenance, or if you’ve recently had parts replaced, having receipts and reports for as much maintenance work as possible is a great way to impress potential buyers. It shows that your vehicle has been well looked after and that you’ve added value to it.

, You’ll need to make sure that your vehicle is at its mechanical and cosmetic best if you want it to have appeal and, unless your vehicle has been looked after exceptionally well, this will probably involve some expense.


At the very least, have your vehicle washed and vacuumed, either at home or at a professional car wash. The condition of your lights, windshield, brakes, tires, paintwork, upholstery, and bumpers, not to mention vital elements like oil and the engine, will all affect a buyer’s attitude.
As with all other maintenance work, keep copies of all receipts and reports to show buyers.

, Now that you’ve got your vehicle and its documents in order, you need to check your mileage and get a sense of how much a vehicle like yours is currently worth. In the United States, online guides such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com have user-friendly menus that will help you locate your vehicle and give you a price range based on its age, mileage, and other valuation criteria applied to used vehicles. Form an idea of your lowest price and your asking price.


Experts recommend that you set your asking price somewhere between 97% and 102% of the recommended price but it may help to set it somewhat higher so that you can meet lower offers without losing out., When selling online, appealing images of your vehicle are essential to drawing buyers in but photos that are either too dark, low quality, or insufficient in number can seriously harm your sale. To ensure that this doesn’t happen, position your vehicle in a well-lit, uncrowded, space and shoot at least 40-50 photos of it with a good quality camera as you walk around it.The best place to shoot is in an open space like a beach, park, sports facility, or car park, without many other vehicles or objects in the background.
The ideal time of day to shoot is either shortly after sunrise, or shortly before sunset, when the sun is up but its light is not overly harsh. Avoid shooting in the dark, even with a flash.
Try to use a relatively recent smartphone or digital camera. Avoid using older phones as these produce grainy pictures of low resolution.
Take photos of the interior and exterior from different angles with doors, including the trunk and hood, both open and closed.
Don’t be afraid to photograph scratches and other imperfections. These show honesty and help build trust with potential buyers.
Photographing the odometer helps confirm your stated mileage.

, Keep the title concise and specific, including the make, model, mileage, and price, along with any keywords that describe optional extras or features that buyers might be typing in when they run their searches. Keep the description to a 8-10 sentence paragraph, starting with your vehicle’s best-selling features, such as its mileage, ongoing warranty, or fuel efficiency.Make your description personal and relatable by talking about why you bought it, how you’ve enjoyed it, why you’re selling it and why, despite its age, it would be a great buy because its been taken care of well and is looking for a new home.Spend at least an hour writing your description and proofread it when you’re done.
Save your description offline, in a document file on your computer, so you can edit and proofread it easily.

, This will depend on where you live. In North America and parts of Europe, websites AutoTrader.com, Cars.com, eBay and Craigslist are popular, the last of these being completely free.


Be clear about your asking price and acceptable mode of payment.
Be sure to include a phone number or email address, depending on your communications preferences.
Upload the maximum number of photos allowable and host more on another site such as Flickr.com if you have several that can’t be accommodated.
On websites like Craigslist, you may need to relist your ad every few days, especially if you don’t get many responses, since it will be below more recent ads on the site and new buyers might not see it., Once buyers start to contact you, confirm that they understand the terms of payment. Make appointments for meeting and viewing at a public place only with buyers who seem genuine and serious.


When screening buyers, talk over the phone even if initial contact was through email. Ask about the buyer’s needs and the reasons for them being interested in your vehicle. Also ask if they have any questions for you. This interview-style screening process should be polite and friendly and not like an interrogation! But it will give you a sense of whether a buyer is serious and genuine or not., At your meeting point in a public place, greet the buyer. Give them a walk-around tour of the vehicle and introduce them to it without rushing them. Have your paperwork handy and be prepared to answer questions. If they want to take it further, get in the vehicle for a test drive with them.


Use the drive to get to know the buyer and also to put them at ease with you. If they feel good about you, it will help them feel good about the sale.They might bring a companion and you should consider taking one along too. It is beneficial to have a second opinion and this also provides both parties with security.
Under no circumstances should you let the buyer go off for a test drive without you, or a known associate, in the vehicle.
Avoid discussing the price before or during the test drive or inspection.

, If the buyer is satisfied, negotiate the selling price. Remind the buyer of your asking price and see if they will agree to it but also keep your lowest price in mind.If the buyer cannot come close to your lowest price, or you have other buyers in the picture and would prefer to hold out for your asking price, feel free to decline and move on. Otherwise, if you’re satisfied, be prepared to sell on the spot and complete the paperwork. Depending on where you live, this may involve signing over the title and completing a Bill of Sale.


You will need to judge what your options are when negotiating. If you have time on your side, are in touch with other buyers, and your vehicle is in high demand, you will have considerably more latitude than if you need to get rid of your vehicle urgently and have not had many calls.
Don’t hand over the keys until all the paperwork is complete and you have copies of everything.

Yank out the radio.,
Crack open the radio case and try to get at the read head of the cassette deck.,
Either hack apart an old headphone lead, or preferably buy a 1/8 stereo jack and some wire and make one from scratch.,
Now solder the two upper leads to the read head.,
Now reinstall the radio and snake your new jack lead out a hole somewhere.

,
To activate the cassette function you must insert a tape.

,
Plug in your MP3 player or portable CD player or whatever fits a 1/8 jack, pop in the dead tape and enjoy.

, It's that unit in the center that runs against the tape. Alternatively you can find the first circuit board where the leads from the head go.

, This helps because old headphones have a weird coating that's hard to solder. If you want to be fussy find out which lead is left and which is right. Mine was labeled on the circuit board.

, The tip of the jack is left, the middle bit right, and the base is ground. I attach the ground, but it works without it.

Regardless of which type exam it is, if you have a disability, be sure to inform the contact person so that s/he may make arrangements to accommodate you for this test. Furthermore, realize that the exam is not given by the FCC or its agents, but rather it administered by VE's or ""Volunteer Examiners"". The VE's are hams that hold licenses that are at least one grade (up to Extra Class) higher than the test they are administering. VE's are not compensated for their time and do this work for the benefit of the community and hobby.

, Download from http://ncvec.org/downloads/2014-2018%20Tech%20Pool.txt for free or purchase a softcover copy from your local Radio Shack or bookstore. Make sure the book contains the current ""Technician Question Pool"" (the current pool as of this writing for Technician exams should be identified for use during the period between July 1, 2014 and June 31, 2018. The question pool has recently been updated.). Print out the pool questions if there isn't always a computer available for use when you have the opportunity to study. If the test date chosen falls after the current test question pool expires, ask which pool the test will be based upon.

, The test itself is highly structured. It consists of 35 questions and is a multiple choice format. The questions come from the pool of 426 questions described above. Each question has four possible answers. Only one answer however, is correct. A passing score requires that 26 of the 35 questions be answered correctly. The question pool (downloaded or purchased in book form) lists each of the 426 questions and all four possible answers for each question, word for word. The 'only' difference between the pool questions and an exam's questions are the order of which the answers are presented.


Study the question pool to prepare for the test. Pool questions described above present the correct answer letter in a ""key"" at the top of the question. Read the question. Review the answers and select the answer that you feel is correct. Check your selection against the answer provided in the key. Highlight the correct answer (or strike through each of the three incorrect answers). As mentioned above, the actual exam poses the questions and answers ""word for word"" as the pool questions. The only difference is the order of the answer choices. Do NOT try to learn by associating a question number to an answer letter: ""question 46 is answer b, question 211 is answer d"" and so on. After highlighting the correct answers, during subsequent reviews, read the question and only the highlighted answer. Do not read the incorrect answers. This will assist associating the correct answer with each question.
Dedicate time each day reading the questions and only the correct answers. Studying twenty to 30 minutes once or twice a day should be sufficient preparation an exam that is 3 or 4 weeks away.
Take a practice examinations online. It's free and an excellent method to determine if you're ready for the test. Some exam sites to check out: http://www.aa9pw.com/radio/ (look for the technician Exam link on the left side), http://www.radioexam.org (tests you section by section), http://www.eham.net/exams/ and http://www.qrz.com/testing.html. The QRZ site exam gives INSTANT feedback as you answer each question. Try them all and use those you like best. When able to score 80% or better CONSISTENTLY, you are ready. If you can't score 80% or better, either wait until you can, or take the exam as practice anyway. This will let you know what it is like when you are ready. Who knows, you might just pass!

, Use this opportunity to verify location, time, etc. of the exam. Make sure the VE's have been able to accommodate any disabilities you informed them of in the first contact with them weeks ago.

, Bring the required documents (identification and any certificates if upgrading) and exam fee to the session. As of this writing (2017), the exam fee is $15 (fee may vary from VEC so its also best to ask the VE what the fee is to confirm a exact amount). If you fail, you can take the test again right away - no need to wait for the next exam session. A second testing fee will be required, however. If you miss it by more than a couple questions - it might be best to study a bit more before retesting.

Troubleshoot.",How to Create a Simple AM Radio," The antenna is one of the simplest parts of a homemade radio: all you need is a long piece of wire and a small cylinder. Ideally, the wire should be 50 feet long, but if you don’t have that much, you can use 15 or 20 feet. Use any small diameter insulated wire, like a 20 or 22 gauge., In this radio circuit, you'll need to make a simple inductor. Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field, though the specifics and behaviors of inductors is a little complicated. You can make your own by wrapping wire around a small cylinder. Find a small cylinder. You can use a glass bottle, a cardboard tube, or any other cylinder you can find from around the house. Just make sure it’s not metal, because metal will conduct electricity and throw off your signal. Look for any object with a 2-3 inch diameter.
Gather five inches of slack, then tape the wire to the cylinder at the five-inch point. You can use electrical tape, or any other tape you have on hand. Begin wrapping the wire around the cylinder slowly, pushing the coils together to avoid gaps.
Continue wrapping until the whole cylinder is coiled with wire. Tape off the end, then measure another five inches of slack. Cut the wire off at the five-inch point. You should now have a cylinder completely coiled over with five inches of slack on either side.

, Tuning capacitors set a resonance frequency for the radio, meaning that they allow you to tune in to certain resonances of the medium wave radio bands.Variable tuning capacitors aren’t too expensive, costing around 10-15 dollars if you buy online at sites like Amazon. You may also be able to find one at a local electronics or hobby store like Radio Shack.








, Capacitors and resistors are small electronic components that affect the flow of electricity in different ways. Capacitance is measured in farads (F), while resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). These measurements help you to know which type of capacitors and resistors to buy.Buy one 33pF (pico-farad) capacitor, one 10nF (nano-farad) capacitor and one 22uF (micro-farad) electrolytic capacitor. Capacitors can be bought from a variety of online shops and electronics hobby stores very cheaply, with most vendors selling these specific parts from between two cents and 25 cents.Buy one 1 megohm resistor. Keep in mind that “one megohm” may be abbreviated as “1.0M Ohm” As with the capacitor, shop online or look at electronics shop, and expect prices to range from 10 cents to 25 cents.
Always buy extras of your components. These pieces are very small, and are made inexpensively, so it’s not uncommon to get a faulty piece every once in a while.

, Amplifiers help us take the small signals that we pick up from the radio waves and make them bigger so that we can hear them. For this radio, we’ll use something called an operational amplifier, or op-amp. Op-amps are small integrated circuits with 8 prongs, and they look a bit like small spiders.Look online for a “general purpose” op amp. Search on Amazon or in Mouser Electronics’ catalog, and look for amps in the four to seven dollar price range., Speakers receive voltage amplified by the op amp and turn them into sound waves that we can hear. The voltage moves a magnet, which in turn moves a cone that produces the sound waves.If you have a speaker around the house, feel free to use it. Otherwise, look online for any kind of small speaker with two speaker-wire leads (not the kind that plugs in with a headphone jack).








, Breadboards allow you to create a mockup of a circuit without requiring any soldering. They have many rows and columns of holes, and electrical connections can be made by simply placing component wires into adjacent holes.Breadboards are an inexpensive investment for anyone with an interest in electronics, as they’re easy to use and can be changed over and over again to create new circuits. Look online or in a hobby store, where they’re sold for five to ten dollars.

, You’ll need a bit of wire in two different colors to make into jumpers. You’ll also use it to attach to the ends of your power source. Make sure you have around 10 or 15 inches of each color.

, This particular circuit requires 9 volts of electricity to function. Any variety of 9 volt battery will work. Tape one five inch wire to the negative (flat) end and one five inch wire to the positive (raised) end with electrical tape to get it ready for attachment.


Cut two five-inch pieces of shielded wire. One will attach to each pole of the battery, and then to the circuit board.
Using wire strippers or a sharp knife, cut 1-2mm of shielding off of each end of the wires.
Tape one exposed-metal end of one wire to the positive (raised) end of the battery, using electrical tape. Tape the other wire to the negative (flat) end of the battery, again using electrical tape.

, Lay your breadboard on the table in front of you “long-wise” so that the long edge is facing towards you and the short edges are on the outside. It doesn’t matter which side is on top, because both halves of the breadboard work the same way. Connectivity is achieved by placing components adjacently into the short columns, not the long rows.The only exceptions are the long, connected rows at the top and bottoms of the breadboard. These connect left-to right, not up and down.

, Most breadboards have a long trough running across the middle, separating the board into two equal halves. You’ll want to place your op-amp so that four legs are on one side of the trough and four legs are on the other; four legs on the top half and four legs on the bottom half. This will allow you to build the input (the antenna) on one side of the breadboard and the output (the speaker and tuning capacitor) on the other side.








Be aware that the amplifier has a “front” and a “back”. The “front” of the op-amp has a small circular divot and the “back” does not. Make sure that the “front” is facing towards the left of the breadboard.

, Current flows both ways over a resistor, so you don’t have to worry about it being “backwards” or “forwards”.Place one lead into the hole directly above the op-amp’s second leg on the top side of the amp. Place the other leg in the hole directly below the op-amp’s second leg on the bottom side of the amp. To clarify, “second leg” means second from the left, or “front” of the op-amp.








, Place the short lead of your 10nF capacitor in the hole directly below the lead of your 1.0M Ohm resistor, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Next, place the long lead of your 10nF capacitor in a hole four columns over, to the left.








, Most resistors and ceramic capacitors, like your 10nF and 33pF capacitors, let voltage travel over them in both directions. However, electrolytic capacitors do not: they are “polarized”. This means that they can only accept voltage going in one direction, and it needs to come in on the shorter, or positive leg. Do not apply voltage to the negative, or shorter leg: this can cause the capacitor to fail in a puff of smoke.On the top side of your breadboard, place the long lead of the 22uF capacitor in the hole directly above the top lead of your 1.0M resistor. Again, keep in mind that capacitors only allow voltage to flow in one direction, so the long lead needs to be the one connected to the resistor.
Place the short lead in a hole four rows away from the long lead, to the right.

, Get your black and red insulated wire. Cut one black jumper wire and one red jumper wire. Make sure they’re long enough to reach holes several rows away. Strip the insulation from one both ends of the jumpers. Using a pair of wire strippers, scissors, or a knife, cut off about 2cm of insulation from each end of the wire. This will allow the wire to form connectivity when placed into a hole on the breadboard.








Put one end of the red wire into the hole right above the first leg of the op amp, on the top side. Stick the other end into the long row at the top of the breadboard. Unlike the rest of the grid of the breadboard, which makes connections going up and down, this long row creates connections going left to right across the whole row.
Place one end of the black jumper wire into the hole beneath the fourth, or furthest right leg of the op-amp, on the bottom side of the breadboard. Connect the remaining lead to the bottommost row of the breadboard.

, This capacitor, like the first one you placed, isn’t polarized. There’s no backwards and forwards for this one, as it allows current to pass over it in both directions. It won’t matter which lead goes in which spot.


Look at your 10nF capacitor. One of the leads is attached to a bottom leg of the op-amp. The other isn’t connected to anything yet. Place one lead of your 22pF capacitor into the hole directly above this unconnected 10nF lead.
Put the other lead of your 22pF capacitor into a hole four rows away, to the left. Make sure the row you place it in is empty.

, Your antenna has remained unused up until this point, so let’s go ahead and attach it. Place one end of the antenna into the hole directly above the empty lead of the 22pF capacitor; the lead that you just placed four rows away to the left. Spool the rest of your wire out across the room, as far as the walls will allow you.







, Place the variable capacitor on the table, on the top side of the breadboard. Connect one lead in the hole above the rightmost lead of your 22pF capacitor. Place the other lead in any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with your black jumper wire.








, Place the coil on the table below your breadboard. You saved five inches of slack on either side of the coil, so place the left-hand lead into a hole on the bottommost row, where it will connect to your variable capacitor and your black jumper wire. Place the right-hand lead in a hole in the row where your 22pF capacitor and your 10nF capacitor make connection with the variable capacitor’s lead.








, Place your speaker on the table to the right of the variable capacitor. Your speaker will have one black lead and one red lead, so untwist them and get ready to plug them in. Put the red lead into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the red jumper wire. Place the black lead into the hole directly above the short lead of your 22uF electrolytic capacitor.








, Now that your circuit is finished, give it some power. If you haven’t already used electrical tape to attach wires to the positive and negative sides of the battery, do that now. Remember, the flat end of the battery is negative, and the raised side of the battery is positive.








Place the positive wire into any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard. It will now create connectivity with the black jumper wire and the variable capacitor.
Place the negative wire into any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard, where it will make connectivity with the speaker and the red jumper wire.

, Once the circuit has power, the electricity will begin to flow to the amp and the speaker. The speaker should now be making sound, whether it’s a faint radio signal or just static. This is a good indication that all of your components are correctly connected.








, Turn the variable tuner slowly, listening for audible radio stations. The further away from AM radio stations you live, the weaker the signals will be. However, be patient and turn the knob slowly. You’ll easily find a station with a little patience.








, All circuits are touchy, and many require troubleshooting, especially if this is the first circuit you’ve ever built. Make sure that all leads are firmly pressed into their holes, and that they are all in the correct spots. Continue to check connections until you hear audio. If it fails to work, it may be necessary to rebuild the circuit and repeat the steps again."

ZOOM-XOOM-and Voila !",How to Build Several Easy Antennas for Amateur Radio," The heart of the system of Amateur Radio is the antenna. There are many other misinformed persons stating that power is the ultimate force. Not So ! The heart of any radio station, be it Amateur Radio, Commercial, Business, CB, Personal Family Radio, or experimenters in extremely low power amateur radio ( QRP as it is called ) transmissions IS the antenna! Without good reception, you won't hear much. Without good antennas for transmitting, you won't transmit far, even if you apply high output RF power, or if high output watts are used !;
, Height, length, feedline, balun, (and we will talk about a balun later), insulators, type wire used, or type metal used, what do you want to do with this antenna, how many bands do you want it to perform its work, if you can use the right materials, space to hang one, and the biggest of all downfalls, if you live in a place that has zoning laws, you may have to get permission (gag) to put up an antenna on your own property !

, Antennas can be made from many different materials. Remember that you should use metal of similar nature, as dissimilar metals have a tendency to corrode, or to have a non-conductive properties. Metals such as copper, aluminum, tin, and steel all will conduct electricity, but when we are talking about Radio Frequency, or RF currents and voltages, we are talking about ""Skin Effect"" electricity. Aluminum antenna wire is hard to work with, has a very easy breaking point, and oft times, stretches out of shape, and cannot be soldered using conventional solder. Aluminum wire is not expensive, but it is the least desirable wire for antenna use. Copper house wire prices have skyrocketed in the recent months. Finding old house wire is the best choice. Diameter of 12 gauge wire is about 1/8th inch thick. Its not hard to work with, and is probably the best antenna metal. Tin wire, used for electric fence purposes make an excellent wire antenna, and it is not to expensive. The only draw back is that you have to purchase it in either 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 mile (0.4 or 0.8 km) rolls. If you plan on building several antennas, you should have no problem with this large roll of wire.

, Regular DC or AC current and voltages travel through the center of the wire, whereas RF runs on the outer portions of the wire. Picture if you will, a wire with the cut portion of the wire pointing at you. If we could see the wire with the current on it, it would be easy to define. AC and DC currents would be from the center out. RF though, would be along the outer portions of the wire, like the skin of the wire. The type of metal used would have a conductivity scale. Of course, none of us will be using any precious metals in making an antenna, but the rare metals, gold, silver, and platinum are the three most conductive metals of all, but since they cost so much, we have to settle for copper wire, steel with either a brass, or copper coating, or perhaps tin, with or without copper coating, or plain electric fence type tin wire, or possibly aluminum wire if you have no other wire to use. Any good conductor of electricity will conduct RF. The least favored is the mechanic wire, which has a high resistance, and corrodes and rusts easily, causing unwanted resistance, and antenna failure. When subjected to the weather, mechanic wire will rust easily, creating a never ending problem of either breakage, or a problem of MAJOR non-connectivity. It does NOT radiate RF energy well, and doesn't receive signals from other amateur stations transmitting to you. One of the best, and probably the cheapest is the electric fence wire that is coated with brass, or copper. Since we are dealing with ""skin effect"" properties, just the outer coating will bear the RF energy. Steel wire also should be avoided if possible. Steel will rust easily, even if it is coated in brass or copper. Tin wire that is used for electric fence wire that is not coated, also can be used, but make sure that you inspect the connections from time to time to remove any corrosion, and re-solder them if necessary. Insulated house wire that is solid copper can make one fantastic wire antenna. At least seventy (70) percent of all amateur radio antennas are made of some sort of insulated, or non - insulated wire. Those are the ones we will be talking about here in this article.

, You should NEVER be close to a power line that is energized. Many people have been seriously injured or have been fatally electrocuted due to their contact with high power transmission lines. It takes just one touch from these high power lines to kill someone who is trying to put up an antenna. Look for low hanging power lines, and stay away from them at least by one and a half lengths of the height of your longest pole closest to the power wires. The closer you are to your radio room, the better off you will be. Back yard antennas, right close to your radio room, or radio shack, make it easy to set up and operate. Try to avoid placing any portion of your antenna close to the place where electricity enters your home. Use good straight wire, and avoid serious bends or twists in the wire. If you are using tin with copper or brass coatings, watch out for the tendency to coil back onto the wire. Some tightly wound wire may also coil back on itself, regardless of what it is made from, or coatings. Some wires also have a tendency of having sharp ends when cut. Steel is the worst. Good sharp side cutter pliers, or diagonal cutters can also leave a ridge that is sharp if using certain metals. The smaller the wire, the harder it is to work with also. Using wire of light gauge, either 17, 18, right through 22 or 24 gauge, has many problems, not the least of which is its durability. Wind can destroy an antenna in a few moves with small gauge wires 17 through 22. I recommend using not less than 18 gauge for most antennas. There are places, that we mentioned earlier, that won't allow antennas, towers or antenna poles to be constructed. A dipole in the attic of your home is a good idea if you have enough space in your attic to place one. Folded dipole antennas will work great if you do not have a metal roof.

, Make sure it is a wire that can withstand the weather, both summer and winter, and that it is of a workable nature. In other words, don't use a wire that can cause problems down the road when it is actually put into use. Insulated copper house wire is excellent. Please! do NOT remove the insulation! As a matter of a fact, the life of the antenna can greatly be extended if you do leave the insulation on the wire. Also, it insulates it from a short against a green tree, or tree leaf, or even a weed, or branch that may fall. Make sure that if it is bare wire, that you keep it up from the ground, (and we will get into that also later ) so no unsuspecting person comes in contact with the line, in the event it is energized with RF currents. RF burns can hurt, and burn deeply into the flesh of a finger or hand. RF is a sort of invisible energy, and it is the forced movements of electrons along a given path that is an AC style current.

, It burns, and sometimes actually fries your skin into a white powder. This is called ""RF BITE"" since it feels like you got bit by some sort of bad bug, or stung by a bee that has no poison, but can seriously hurt. Amplified RF also hurts worse, due to the added power applied to the antenna. If you are using a tube type amplifier, depending on the wattage it has been tuned to, can and will give you one powerful bite,!, and it will hurt badly.

, Dipole antennas often are the easiest to build, and then turned into inverted V antennas by raising the center of the antennas up into the inverted V style. It's a good idea to have your antenna at least one half ( 1/2 ) wavelength of the antenna. one quarter (1/4) wave is the minimum height above ground for effective performance. Wire ""J"" poles for VHF are easily built, and can be used in an emergency. These inventions simply use the ever popular 300 Ohm antenna lead in wire. You can use them for any frequency, including the HF bands, but you will need a tall tower, or a high tree to hang them high in the sky. As of this writing, 300 Ohm antenna wire is pretty scarce. A roll of 300 or 450 Ohm antenna wire was $55.00 just a year ago. Now if you can find it from any source, the same roll costs $95.00.

, Choose which ever line fits your particular need. RG8 mini 8 can handle up to 2 kilowatts. RG8U, which is the large wire, with either foam or plastic center insulator and can be used up to 3 kilowatts, Hard line such 9913 series is the best for VHF or UHF transmissions. 300 Ohm covered ladder line is great if you have a long run, say more than 150 feet (45.7 m). Open feed line is trouble, but you can use it, IF IT DOESN'T act like like an antenna. If you cut open ladder line in less than a wave, it can act as your antenna instead of your radiator antenna element. Avoid using odd lengths of transmission line, and try to do the wave lengths version to prevent parasitic transmissions, and falling on your neighbors antenna, or bleeding off into someones cell phone, or perhaps even setting off home alarm systems that are close in your neighborhood. Car alarms that are not shielded can oft times be set off by using certain frequencies. Please take note here, if you are running amateur radio, and it's been checked out, it's NOT your fault that your neighbors are having problems. It's the poor design, shielding and the sensitivity of their equipment that is at fault. Sometimes, a solution can be reached, other times, there is no solution other than they have to put a filter, or a suppressor on their equipment to keep their equipment from malfunctioning, and acting as a receiver. The FCC also states that our equipment must not cause unwanted interference from occurring. In order to defend yourself, make note of the frequency you were using at the time the incident occurred, and if you have not had your equipment tested, have your equipment put on a spectrum analyzer, or a harmonic detector to PROVE your equipment is NOT causing any unwanted interference. If your equipment is clean, then it's up to the other party to take action to prevent them from getting on the ham band.

, Some idiot kids are blaming amateur radio operators for their stupid mistakes. There are frequencies that we use that can cause malfunctions of their precious little toys, such as RC cars, airplanes and robots. Once again, its not the hams fault. It's mainly due to a flaw in design, shielding or it could be that their toys are acting as a receiver, and for that, they blame you. Such was a case not long ago, and we will discuss the outcome of that incident, but first let us talk building antennas.

, What is maximum output.? The term Peak Envelope Power or PEP, is the maximum output power allowed by law peak to peak envelope, cycling from an AC source, RF output. With recent changes to some laws, the local government can also regulate how much power you can use. Legally, Amateur radio operators can run up to 1500 watts! That's a lot, but consider this, a ten thousand dollar set up with a 50 cent antenna, isn't gonna serve you well. Whether you live in the country, or in the city, the antenna is the root of good transmit / receive functions.

, The way to find out what length you need for a DIPOLE antenna, which is the most common antenna used, you use mathematical equation, 468/ FMhz whereas, 468 is the one standard, the fMHz is Frequency in MEGAHERTZ, and that give you the total length of a dipole antenna in feet. Divide by 2 and place a ceramic, dog bone, or even PCV pipe insulator between them in the middle where you just cut, and you got a dipole antenna. Attach a feed line, and run to your tuner, or if you are gonna use resonant antennas, attach to your SWR meter, and check for high SWR readings. Usually, less than a 1:5 to one or less is acceptable, but a 1:1 match reading is the very best. Using resonant antennas can be the most fulfilling experience of antenna use, however space and materials can pose a factor in using several antennas that are resonant to each band.

, Inverted V antennas can be tied off as high as possible, but can go as low as 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) from the ground. Place a warning sign on the tie off point if your antenna is low enough to touch, telling anyone that high voltages can be present at any time, and not to touch the wire in any way.

, The more capture area that is available, the better the transmit or receive. Secure line with good strong, nylon or rayon rope. Use either 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 inch (0.6 or 1.3 cm) plastic nylon or rayon rope, and then you will find that these works best, but you should inspect them at least twice a year for frays, or weathering problems. Replace if necessary.

, For many years now, designing antennas has been a passion for many a ham operator. The next one on the list is a cage dipole. For this, you will need either 4 or 6 inch (10.2 or 15.2 cm), thick wall PVC sewer, or water pipe, and a way to cut it in either 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 inch (0.6 or 1.3 cm) spreaders. Use of a compound mitre saw makes this job easy. Use a 12"" saw to cut the 6 and 4 inch pipes. WATCH OUT THOUGH, SINCE THE LAST FOOT OF THE PIPE COULD BUCK AGAINST THE SAW and may not cut through the pipe, and throw it back at you. Cut only where it will NOT be dangerous. usually 12 to 14 inches (30.5 to 35.6 cm) of the pipe will be left. If you own, or have a friend who owns one of the saws, use it to cut the pipes. Once they have been cut, measure the outside diameter of the pipe spreaders on the OUTSIDE in metric CM and MM. After you have the circumference, divide by 6 if you are using 6 wires, or divide by 8 if you plan on using 8 wires for this project. After you have the pattern down, use a drill with a 1/8th or a 5/32ths drill bit, depending on the gauge wire used to put 6 or 8 holes in each spreader. Be accurate as possible.

, It will be shorter than a regular dipole! It is relative to the size spreader used! You can only use the original formula as a starting point. Depending on spreader size you may have to reduce the length by as much as 4% or more!Just remember that you will either use 6 wires or 8 wires. Electric fence wire is often a choice in this type of an antenna, as it is relatively inexpensive, and can be bought in large rolls of one quarter or half mile or more wire on one spool. Tin wire will work in this project, however copper is best Using anything other than copper can compromise performance

, It's always better to go a little too long, than too short, and then have to add wire. Cut full run lengths of 6 or 8 wires. Its always a good idea to have a couple friends working with you when it comes to this project. Make the wires you have cut come together at the center when you have done your measurements.

, Slide 5 spreaders on the wire, using 4 of them, easing them all the way down to the other end. Next, space the spreaders with the wires through the holes at intervals of either 18 or 20 inches (45.7 or 50.8 cm) apart. Put contact cement on the tooth picks, or match stems before sliding them into the holes with the wires to hold them firm. Leave one spreader at the first end, that way, it will show you where to place your wires into the spreaders. Continue with the spreaders, using 4 or 5 spreaders at a time, leaving one at the end each time. Tighten wire, and then peg the wires with the sharp toothpicks, or wood matches, using ONLY the wood on the matches. After you reach the end of one side of the cage, gather up all the loose wires at both ends, and tie them together using a piece of wire, wrapping all wire ends together near the center of the spreader. Lay this leg of the dipole aside, and do the same with the other leg.

, Whether you use 18 inch (45.7 cm) or 20 inch (50.8 cm) spacings in between the spreaders, to make it look good, don't change the spreaders in alternately positions. If you use 18 inch (45.7 cm) spacings, use them all the way to the end of the antenna. If you use 20 inch (50.8 cm) spacings, use all spacings at 20 inches (50.8 cm) apart. Larger wires in gauges of 14 or 12 can add weight to this project, so it takes a lot to get these antennas going. Don't rush this project! Take your time, do it right the first time, and then, you can rest assured that your antenna will serve your purpose. The capture area of a 6 wire cage dipole has increased 5 times ! An EIGHT wire antenna increases gain of capture by 7 ! Although it is hard to work with, and build this antenna, for amateur radio use, it's one of the best.

, One of the best kept secrets of Amateur radio antennas are either the box, or delta loop antennas. Resonant antennas cut to the exact frequency, in the middle portion of the band, and used with a tuner of sufficient size, can tune several bands. The formula used to find a full wave loop antenna is 1005 / FMhz. This gives you the length of a full wave loop antenna for the band you are using. Horizontal positioning into a TRIANGLE shape, makes it a DELTA loop, If you put it into a square, or rectangle shape, you have a BOX loop antenna. Out in the country is where this antenna is most often used. It requires a large area of land, and also it can be fed either in the middle, or an end portion of the loop. When hoisting this little monster of an antenna into the air, watch out, as we said before, for POWER LINES~! Trees that are spaced far enough apart provide ample heights above ground for this antenna. Trees are often called, ""Poor Mans Towers"" and either can be accessed for use by using several methods, including a good fishing pole and a 4 ounce sinker, properly aimed at a high branch in the tree. When it is successful, tie a masons line, or even affix the rope you are going to use to the line, and gently roll in your catch over the branches of the tree, and pull it down to the ground. Don't forget to use adequate lengths of rope, or safety cord for this project. You can use PVC pipe here as an insulator. Cut 3 or 4 pieces of 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) PVC pipe about 6 or 7 inches (15.2 or 17.8 cm) long. Drill 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) holes using a good drill bit, and never drill close to the end of the pipe. About 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end gives you a good spacing for the insulators. For the feed point, use yet another piece of PVC pipe, drilling a hole through the center to provide for a strain relief for the feedline. Put the stress on the pipe, not on the antenna or on the feedline. Pull up your antenna into the trees or your tower very carefully, making sure that it is as close as possible to the design you chose to make the antenna. Box or rectangle loop, or a triangle, spacing them out as much as possible. Yes, you can fudge a little if you have to on the sides, making one a little longer, but its best to keep your antenna as practical as possible to the design.

Compare radio features and quality by going to a store that has a selection of short wave radios from which to listen.,
Upgrade to a larger and/or external antenna to improve reception.,
Become familiar with shortwave bands.,
Scan the shortwave bands and find content ""hit or miss"".,
Request and collect QSL cards by sending an ""SWL (Short Wave Listener) Reception Report"" to a broadcaster.",How to Use a Shortwave Radio,"


Analog shortwave can be found at $30-70 and well beyond. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a common mode for broadcasters, but there is also Single Side Band (SSB) mode.
An SSB radio will receive both SSB and AM modes, but an AM only mode radio will not allow intelligible SSB monitoring.
Digital tuners (sometimes called PLL or Phase Locked Loop) are more expensive, but make it easy to precisely tune and lock on a particular frequency. Drift is virtually eliminated. These tuners can also easily scan and memorize frequencies. However, many inexpensive digital tuners present the listener with ""chopping"" sounds or ""automatic muting"" while tuning, that analog tuners do not exhibit. This would only be a problem when attempting to scan shortwave bands for content, not when there is a specific frequency that you wish to tune. See Tips.;
, Google ""SWL Antenna"" for ready to install types from manufacturers, or make your own. Nearly anything will be better than just the telescopic rod type antenna included with the radio; adding long length of wire clamped to the rod antenna with a simple alligator clip can work wonders! Move the wire around to find the optimum location for best reception.

, There are multiple shortwave bands named 25 meters, 31 meters, 49 meters, etc. Each band encompasses a specific frequency range. Some radios show frequency in megahertz (MHz) and other in kilohertz (KHz). You may need to consult your radio's manual in order to find out how to get into specific bands. Generally, most bands have the clearest signals at sunrise and sunset, although some are better at night and others are better during the day (see Sources below).

,


Annual publications like World Radio TV Handbook and Passport to World Band Radio provide frequencies and schedules of broadcasters.
There are websites that will tell you which broadcaster is using the frequency as well as provide a schedule of English language shortwave broadcast .
Some people look for certain kinds of content:
Foreign stations - this pursuit is often referred to as DXing; DX is the telegraphic shorthand for ""distant.""
Specialized shortwave utility, or ""ute"", transmissions - e.g. maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals.
Numbers stations - broadcasts of voices reading in unidentified code; the origin is uncertain, and the purpose is suspected by many to be espionage.
Interactive communication between amateur radio operators.



, This is optional, but many shortwave listeners enjoy collecting QSLs as keepsakes, and you provide the broadcaster with valuable feedback and information. To put together an SWL Reception Report, you'll need to record the following information:
• When and how the station identifies itself.
• The name of the program.
• Content of the news or other program
• Names of the announcer(s).
• Items unique to the locality of the station.
• How well the signal was received using the SINPO code:


Signal. Refers to the strength of the signal received.
Interference. Indicates whether other stations were interfering with the signal.
Noise. Identifies the presence of atmospheric or other noise on the frequency.
Propagation. Refers to the fading characteristics of the signal.
Overall. Tells the station how well you received their signal.

In some cases the only sign is an out of place wire. Unless you're very familiar with your car, keep the manual handy to stop yourself yanking out a vital part.;
, Get on your back and shine your flashlight onto the underside of the car. Most trackers link to GPS satellites, and won't function deep under your car where metal blocks the connection.Focus on the perimeter of the underside, looking for suspicious boxes, taped-on objects, and antennas.


If you see something odd, give it a light tug. Most tracking devices are magnetic and will detach easily.
Check the gas tank first. Its large metal surface makes it an easy spot to attach a magnetic device.

, Check under the plastic guard of each wheel well, especially if it feels loose or bent. Any tracker should be obvious here — your car did not come with any weird boxes in this location.


If someone had extended access to your vehicle, you could remove the tires and check behind them, but it's not too likely a location. If you do look there, be aware that some brakes have a wired sensor behind them that is supposed to be there., The front and rear bumpers are the last common exterior locations to place a cheap tracker.Check behind them anywhere someone could slip in a device.


A device under the front bumper may be wired to the car's electrical system. Always compare the wiring to the manual before you remove anything.

, This is only a feasible location in two scenarios. First, an SUV or other tall vehicle can host a device perched in plain sight. Second, a sunroof can hide a small device inside the retraction slot.

, The front of a car is a hot, solid metal box regularly inspected by the driver. This makes it a terrible spot for a tracker. It's not impossible, but the average jealous partner or paranoid neighbor is unlikely to try this. Give it a quick glance and move on to the interior.


Out of place wires to the car battery may lead to a tracking device. Compare the wiring to your manual's diagrams before jumping to conclusions.

, Unzip seat cushions and headrests if possible. Look under any removable parts.

, Shine the flashlight up onto the underside of the seats. Note that some seats have heating mechanisms built in. Compare the appearance of the two front seats to find anomalies.

, On most models, you can unscrew the glovebox compartment, plus the panel underneath the steering wheel. Look for a loose wire that isn't taped or tied to other wires, and try to trace it back to its source. Run your fingers on the underside of the dash to feel for an antenna that's been glued or taped on., Remember that most trackers cannot receive signals through metal. Focus on areas directly underneath the rear window before checking metal trunks. Remove the spare tire and check the well thoroughly.

, If you still haven't found a tracker, chances are good there isn't one. If you're still suspicious, hire someone to sweep the vehicle again. Try these professionals:


A car alarm installer that sells GPS trackers
A mechanic with experience finding trackers
A private investigator

, Devices that actively transmit your location can be pinpointed with handheld detectors. (Some devices store info for later retrieval, and can hide from these sensors.) If you're willing to pay a significant price, look for a company that sells Technical Surveillance Counter Measures (TSCM).The tracker may only transmit occasionally and/or when the car is moving, so test while your friend is driving somewhere remote. (Nearby cell phone transmissions can interfere with the device.)"

To prevent this, always work on a flat surface away from moving vehicles or distractions. The surface you work on should be hard and sturdy so that it will not shift or give way while you are working.


A concrete driveway or garage away from the road are good examples. A yard is a bad choice — even if it's flat, the dirt may not be strong enough to support the car.;
, Chocks are wedge-shaped blocks made from metal and rubber that keep the wheels from rolling. Set a chock in front of each wheel at the opposite end of the car from where you intend to lift.""









If you don't have chocks, some sources recommend bricks, cinder blocks, large rocks, or wedge-shaped pieces of wood., Set the park brake and ensure the transmission is in ""P."" If the car has a manual transmission, put it in the lowest forward gear.








, As noted above, the instructions in this section are intended to protect yourself and others in the event the car slips off its jack. If you can't meet the conditions above but you absolutely must jack up the car, use the instructions below to make the process safer:









If you must jack the car on a soft or broken surface such as a dirt shoulder, use a thick, flat piece of wood to make a stable platform for the jack.
If you must jack the car on a slight incline, park next to the curb and turn the wheels in to the curb so that they are touching it. This will prevent an out-of-control car from hurting others if it slips off the jack.
Similarly, if you don't have anything to block the wheels with, turn the tires into the curb.Never jack the car on the shoulder of a roadway. If you must jack the car somewhere near traffic, put on your hazard lights. If you have flares, cones, or pylons, use these to direct traffic away from you.

, Most vehicles have several points along the body where the vehicle is designed to be lifted. If you lift somewhere else, the car's own weight may cause damage to the frame (or, worse — cause it to slip off the jack). Luckily, the owner's manual will almost always tell you where a car's jack points are.


Typically, there is a jack point on each side behind the front wheels and in front of the back wheels. This will often be next to the rocker panels (the metal or plastic strips beneath the doors).
Sometimes, there are two more central jack points located just behind the front and rear bumpers.
If you're not sure where the jack points are, look for a flat metal area along the pinch weld (the weld running down the side of the car beneath the doors). There may also be a notch that matches the shape of the top of the jack, a cutout in the plastic skirt that exposes metal, or a sturdy plastic block attached to the frame. There may even be a spot labeled ""jack"" on the undercarriage.

, Slide your jack underneath the jack point you just found. It doesn't need to be lined up perfectly — you will be able to slide it around until it is touching the car.









Make sure the correct side is facing up. If the jack itself isn't labeled with a ""this side up"" warning, look in your owner's manual for visual instructions. Typically, the jack will have a wide, flat base and a smaller upward-facing arm with ""teeth"" at the edges pointing up into the body of the car.

, The precise way to do this will depend on which type of jack you have (see below). As the upper arm of the jack nears the underside of the car, make last-minute adjustments as needed so that it lines up with the jack point.










Scissor Jacks: These jacks look like two horizontal metal plates with a diamond-shaped mechanism in between. On one side of the jack is a metal hole connected to the main screw drive. Slip the included rod tool through the hole and turn to pull the sides of the jack inward and push the top and bottom of the jack apart. This lifts the vehicle.

Hydraulic Jacks: Also called bottle or floor jacks. These look like metal base sections with a lever-like base extending to one side. There is a slot to slip the included rod tool into on one side. Crank the rod up and down in long, steady strokes to pump hydraulic fluid into the cylinder and raise the jack.

, When the jack makes contact with the underside of the car, it will become harder to raise. Keep working the jack upward until you notice the corner of the car leave the ground. You can stop when the car has enough clearance for you to do your work. For common tasks like changing a tire, just a few inches is all that's necessary.









Pay careful attention to any sound or movement while lifting the car. It is common to hear a 'pop' or a 'thud' as the jack shifts slightly. If this happens, check that it hasn't slipped out of position before continuing.
Keep all parts of your body out from under the car at all times while lifting it. Though unlikely, serious injury or death can result if the car slips off the jack past this point.

, Work that requires you to put any part of your body under the car calls for jack stands. These offer a wider, more secure base for the car's weight than ordinary jacks. It is unsafe to work under the car without jack stands. See our jack stands article for detailed instructions. Typical use is as follows:








Slip two jack stands underneath the car near where the jack is supporting it. Line the stands up with the pinch weld or jack point. Raise the jack stands until they are nearly touching the underside of the car. Lower the jack slowly and carefully until the jack stands ""catch"" the car.
If you are not working under the car (for instance, if you are changing a tire), you can proceed without jack stands. Take care not to put any part of your body underneath the car as you work.

, At this point, you are ready to do whatever work you need to do on your car. When you are done, gradually lower the car back to the ground, remove the jack, and put it away. If you are using jack stands, you must first raise the car off of the stands, then remove the stands, and finally lower the car. See below:










Scissor Jacks: Slip the rod into the screw drive hole and turn in the opposite direction as you did to raise the car.

Hydraulic Jacks: Open the relief valve to let fluid drain from the hydraulic cylinder, which lowers the arm. The valve is usually a small screw keyed to the lever. Take care to open the valve slowly to avoid suddenly dropping the car.

Get involved with a local station.,
Get an internship.,
If possible, get a broadcasting education.,
Be prepared to pay for time on for-profit stations.,
Consider starting with internet radio.",How to Host Your Own Talk Radio Show1," If you're starting with zero experience, the best way (bar none) to get any sort of radio show is to start participating in the process of creating an existing radio show. Working or volunteering in a radio station gives you an introduction to the workflow and regular tasks that go into producing a successful radio show. It also gives you much-needed experience to put on your resume when you're applying for airtime. Most importantly, it gives you a chance to make contacts inside the station. Knowing someone in the industry can make all the difference in the world when it comes to landing your first show — radio station staff are much, much more likely to hire people they know and trust to be show hosts than they are to hire strangers.


One great idea for building up your radio station experience is to try volunteering for a local community radio station (like, for instance, a college radio station). These stations are usually not operated for profit and depend on the work of volunteers to stay on the air, which means it can be relatively easy to find a place on the staff compared to a for-profit station.;
, Some radio stations offer internships and apprenticeships to interested applicants, especially young students. Some of these internships are integrated with a local school or college's communications department, which means that they usually recruit solely from the pool of students in the department, while other internships may accept applicants from the general public.


Depending on the amount of time you work, an internship can sometimes be more useful for getting a show than working from the bottom up in the station. Good internships are career-focused and offer opportunities for employment after the completion of the internship. However, even with an internship, it may be necessary to work in the radio industry for several years before getting a show.

, Following the correct educational path for becoming a radio host will only help your chances of getting your own show. Also, as noted above, educational programs often pave the way for valuable internship and apprenticeship opportunities. If it's financially feasible for you to do so, consider earning a degree in communications or broadcasting to boost your resume and give you valuable background knowledge and experience.


It's worth noting that an educational background in communications or broadcasting isn't absolutely necessary for a successful career in radio. Several of the most recognizable names in radio, like Howard Stern, have communications degrees, but others have no pertinent educational background. For instance, Adam Carolla, one-time host of Loveline and The Adam Carolla Show, completed only a partial junior college education which included work in a ceramics major., Though all stations will have their own rules for their show hosts, generally, local for-profit stations will charge the hosts for their show time.Times where listener numbers are high (like morning and afternoon commute times) are generally expensive, while less-popular times are generally cheaper. The hosts can pay for their shows with their own money, solicit donations from viewers, or sell advertising time to third parties. If they make more money from advertising fees than it costs to keep the show on the air, they generally keep the difference as a profit. Successful radio hosts can support themselves this way. Understanding ahead of time that you may need to pay for your show time is crucial — you don't want to pursue a coveted time slot only to find out that you can't afford to run your show.


Because of the cost of hosting a radio show, it's often a wise idea to retain another job (at least until you can generate enough advertising revenue to support your show). Dedicating yourself full-time to your radio career is great for your show, but not if you run out of funds and have to go off the air in a few months.
Costs vary. For instance, at some local stations, radio time can cost anywhere from $60-$200 per hour, depending on the time slot.

, For first-timers to the world of radio broadcasting, the internet offers a way to get your voice hear with very few (if any) up-front costs and no experience requirements. If you have the computer know-how, you may want to set up a dedicated audio stream to broadcast your show (see How to Stream Live Audio or an online guide, like the one here). You may also want to try a cheap or free online broadcasting service like Justin.tv (free; allows video broadcasting), Live365.com (cheap; free trial) or Radionomy.com (free for 9 months with conditions).The downside of having an internet radio show is that it's basically up to you to promote your own show and grow your audience — you won't have the resources of an established station to help you.
Another great option is to record a regular podcast. Podcasts are essentially pre-recorded talk radio shows that listeners can download and listen to as they please. For more information on podcasts, see How to Start Your Own Podcast or scroll down to the podcasting section below.

Don't forget to promote your show.",How to Host Your Own Talk Radio Show2," Before you start broadcasting, you'll want to have decided on a ""purpose"" for your show. While many shows are remarkably flexible in terms of their structure and the topics they cover, in general, most successful talk shows have a pre-defined theme or goal. This can be quite broad, so don't feel the need to pigeon-hole your show with an extremely specific theme. Simply ask yourself, ""what is my show about?"" Below are a few common talk radio show themes to get you started:


News/current events
Political commentary
Music news/Underground music discussion
Humor/parody
Educational topics (history, science, etc.)
Advice (relationships, DIY projects, etc.)
Niche topics (paranormal, conspiracy theories, etc.)

, Don't ""wing it"" in the studio unless you're an experienced broadcaster. Scheduling (or ""blocking"") out the time you have available for your show is a must, especially if it's your first show. Having a plan beforehand allows you to keep the momentum of the show high and makes it harder for you to run out of things to talk about. During your first few shows, you'll inevitably discover that your schedule doesn't perfectly match with reality — some segments may take longer than you anticipated, while others take less time. Take note of these differences and adjust your schedule as needed.


Let's say that we've just gotten our first 90-minute political talk radio show. Here's an example of a schedule we might have for our first show:






(5 minutes) Theme song and introductions.

(20 minutes) Guest interview: Author Jane Smith.

(15 minutes) Discussion topic 1: Minimum Wage — too high or too low?

(5 minutes) Ads.

(10 minutes) Take calls.

(15 minutes) Discussion topic 2: Gerrymandering — how big of problem is it in the modern age?

(5 minutes) Ads.

(10 minutes) Take calls.

(5 minutes) Allow guest to plug upcoming events. Follow with farewell and outro music.







, When it comes to talk radio, consistency is key. Listeners want to be confident that they'll be able to hear the same content and style of discussions whenever they tune into your show. Some change may be unavoidable: for instance, if a particular aspect of your show isn't working out, it's better to drop it than allow it to limp along as an unpopular part of the show. However, whenever possible, you'll want to keep the basics of your schedule the same from one show to the next while allowing for fresh content in the form of new segments and so on.

, One way to keep your show fresh and interesting while keeping its format consistent is to continuously invite interesting, exciting guests on to your show. Guests bring their own knowledge and conversational style to the show, contributing to enlightening (or at least entertaining) discussions. Usually, in exchange for coming on the show, the guest is allowed to promote his or her personal projects on-air.


The types of guests you should invite will vary based on the format of your show. For instance, if you're running a serious art criticism talk show, you might invite guests who offer new perspectives and unique expertise, like professors and artists. On the other hand, if you're hosting a crass ""shock jock"" comedy show, you might want to invite fellow comedians or even bizarre local personalities.

, It's almost always a good idea to encourage a friendly, open atmosphere between yourself and your callers. If you've got an active audience, it's easier to keep the momentum of your show's dialog high than if you don't. Opening up your phone line to callers allows you to briefly take a break from thinking up new, interesting avenues of discussion. Instead, you can let your listeners direct the conversation for you — all you have to do is respond.


If you're on a station with rules against profanity, be on the lookout for prank callers. Always know how to quickly disconnect a call. If your station operates on a time delay, be aware of how to delete the last few seconds of airtime in the event that a caller says something inappropriate. Most stations will have an easily-accessible delay button somewhere near the main sound board.
If you're broadcasting online, you may want to experiment with taking callers via voicechat software like Skype. Otherwise, you may want to have a text chat channel for your listeners which you occasionally monitor for relevant discussion.

, Whether you've got a show on community radio with a tiny local audience or a nationally-syndicated morning show, you'll want to follow the golden rule of radio broadcasting: avoid ""dead air"" (distracting periods of silence). Ordinary pauses in conversation are one thing — you don't need to be talking for every single second of your show. However, you will want to avoid stretches of silence that are more than a few seconds long. These are awkward to listen to, sound unprofessional, and can lead to an immediate dip in listenership if it sounds like you're having a technical error.


You may find that it's a good idea to keep a piece of new music (or a similar audio clip) queued up and ready to play in the event that something takes you by surprise and you need a few minutes of time.

, As noted above, it's a very real possibility that you may have to pay for your show's airtime. To help pay for your show, try to find advertisers who are willing to put up a little money to have their message broadcast on-air. Advertisers can pay you a fee or agree to cover some of the costs of your show in exchange for you dedicating a chunk of your airtime to ads. Some radio show hosts read the advertiser's ad themselves, while others opt to play pre-recorded ads. Generally, rates for radio advertising increase with the length of the ad, the desirability of the time slot, and the number of listeners to the show.


Ad prices can also vary greatly by market. For instance, 60 ads in a market like Los Angeles can cost up to $500, while the same number of ads might go for as little as $3 in a small rural town., Never forget that as a radio show host, you live and die by your listeners. The more listeners you have, the better. With more listeners, you can charge your advertisers more per ad, negotiate more lucrative deals with your station, and promote yourself and your guests to a wider audience, so always be trying to increase your listenership by promoting your show.


One great way to do this is by advertising on other shows (especially those in desirable time slots) that broadcast from the same station as you. Many stations offer a reduced in-house rate for cross-promoting your show.

Consider recruiting a co-host.,
Schedule regular features.,
Create memorable one-off segments.,
Build a relationship with frequent contributors.,
Create an on-air persona.,
When in doubt, learn from the greats.",How to Host Your Own Talk Radio Show3," For talk radio shows, having a second (or third, or fourth...) person in the studio with you every show makes your job easier in just about every way imaginable. Most importantly, co-hosts offer their own unique personality and thoughts to every discussion you have, ensuring that your own voice and views don't get stale. It also allows you to have friendly debate — the back-and-forth between a pair of co-hosts who can lovingly bicker is often one of the most entertaining parts of a talk show. If you're thinking of getting a co-host, make sure it's someone you get along with and who understands the commitments of the job.


Co-hosts have other benefits, too. For instance, some may be willing to split the cost of airtime with you or help search for and book guests.

, For the listener, some of the fun of listening to their favorite shows is from anticipating, listening to, and even participating in their favorite recurring features. As long as you obey the rules of your station (and, of course, local laws) there's virtually no limit when it comes to what sorts of segments you can run, so be creative! Below are just a few ideas to get you started:


Call-in trivia contests for prizes or recognition
Live or pre-recorded man-on-the-street segments
""100th caller wins"" type contests
Soliciting listeners for certain types of stories
On-air creative comedy/improv exercises

, Just because your viewers are likely to appreciate the consistency of recurring segments doesn't mean that you should necessarily shy away from special one-time events and features. Experimenting with new ideas while keeping the basic format and structure of your show intact allows you to continually innovate and surprise your audience. It's also a good way to find new directions for the show to go in — anything that gets an especially good reaction can eventually be made a recurring segment.

, If you notice that certain people seem to call in to the station on a regular basis or that certain guests seem especially popular with your listeners, don't let these people go to waste! Instead, try to create a friendly working relationship with them. Talk to these people off the air and ask if they'd like to become a regular part of the show. Even if they aren't interested in joining the show as a dedicated cast member, they may appreciate being made a ""friend of the show"" or gaining recognition as an official contributor.


For instance, if one of your callers has a boisterous, outrageous personality and insane political beliefs, you may want to have a semi-regular segment where he calls in and comments on the issues of the day.

, Some talk radio shows, especially those that examine or critique serious topics, are dignified affairs. However, many talk shows are known for the exaggerated, crass, or outlandish characters assumed by their hosts. If your show is mainly interested in entertaining your listeners, consider creating such a character for yourself. The interplay between a crazy host character and a straightman co-host or an unwitting caller can make for great radio.

, No one's radio show is perfect from the get-go. It can take years of experience to develop your broadcast craft to the point that you can deliver a great show every day. During this time, it's a great idea to look to some of the best radio shows and podcasts in the world for inspiration. There's no shame in getting ideas from those who are already successful — they, too, had role models in the world of broadcasting before they became famous (for instance, Howard Stern cites radio host Bob Grant as an influence).Below are a few great radio shows and podcasts you may want to consider listening to:



This American Life — Politics, serious issues, human interest stories

The Howard Stern Show — ""Shock jock"" style raunchy humor

The Ron and Fez Show — humor, chat

Car Talk (no longer running) — automotive advice

Comedy Bang Bang (podcast) — absurdist comedy, improv

The Bugle (podcast) — news, politics

Record your show.,
Edit your audio file.,
Upload your show to a hosting site.,
Optionally, create a blog or website for your podcast.",How to Host Your Own Talk Radio Show4," To the listener, the difference between a radio talk show and a podcast is minor — both involve listening to a host and/or a set of co-hosts talk about familiar subjects with or without a guest. However, for you, the host, recording a podcast is a little different than recording a live show. You'll perform your show basically as you normally would, but rather than broadcasting it live, you'll record it and offer it for download on the internet. To do this, you'll need to an equipment setup that allows you to record reasonably high-quality audio files and sufficient hard drive space to store them.


For the most basic podcasting needs, you can get away with a computer and a reasonable-quality microphone, which usually run upwards of $100 at audio equipment stores.

, After recording your show, you may want to listen to your audio file and, if necessary, cut out any portions that you don't want to make the final podcast. To do this, you'll need audio-editing software (some free programs, like Audacity, are available online). Insert ads, intro, and outro music, or anything else you'd to add to your podcast.


When you're done, save your file in a widely-used audio format that will be easy for your audience to use, like .mp3.

, Make your podcast available to your listeners online. A variety of free hosting sites, like Youtube.com, Soundcloud.com, and many others allow you to upload audio files with a free account. Note that, with these sites, per-file-bandwidth limits may require you to split your podcast into multiple parts. You may also want to try hosting your podcast on online audio stores like the iTunes Store, Google Play store, and so on.


Generally, most podcasts are offered to the listener for free and are supported by donations, sponsors, or advertisers. Charging money for your podcast can decimate your potential listenership when you're competing against literally hundreds of good free podcasts, so it's not usually a good idea.

, Generally, the most professional podcasts have their own websites which contain links to the podcast episodes, as well as podcast news, a store for merchandise, and so on. You may want to purchase your own domain name and build your site from scratch, but for many, a free blog-creation service like Wordpress.com works perfectly well.

Hold the metal frame as you exit the car.,
Use a coin to touch the car.,
Touch the window for a couple seconds.",How to Get out of a Car Without Getting Shocked by Static Electricity1," Most shocks happen because you and the car have picked up opposite charges. Leaving your seat separates these charges, creating the potential for a static shock. Touching the metal of the car as you get out lets the charge balance out by flowing harmlessly through your hand.If you still get shocked, the paint on the metal might not be conductive enough. Touch bare metal instead.;
, Another way to protect yourself is to touch the car with a coin or other metal object after you get out. You might see a spark travel between the car and the coin, but it won't hurt your hand.


Don't use a key that contains an electronic chip. The shock could destroy the chip and make your key unusable., If you've already left the car and don't have any coins on you, put your hand on the window. Glass is less conductive than metal, so the charge will run through you too gently to cause a shock."
"
Wear shoes with conductive soles.,
Treat the car seats with fabric softener.,
Be aware of your clothing.,
Attach a grounding strap if you have non-conductive tires.",How to Get out of a Car Without Getting Shocked by Static Electricity2," Most shoes with rubber or plastic soles insulate you from the ground. If you switch to shoes with real leather soles, or special electrical static discharge (ESD) shoes, charge will have more trouble building up on your body.Even if you do pick up charge during a car ride, it should flow out through these shoes as soon as you step onto the ground.

, Rubbing fabric softener sheets onto the car seat can eliminate static cling, at least for a few days. Alternatively, mix a teaspoon (5 mL) of liquid fabric softener in a quart (liter) of water. Mix well and spray onto the seat., Synthetic materials, such as most modern fleeces, increase the risk of static shock. Even natural fibers like wool or cotton can build up a high charge, though, so it's not worth changing your wardrobe.Just be extra careful while you're wearing polyester.

, ""Low rolling resistance"" tires made with silica are poor electrical conductors. This can cause the car to pick up a static charge as you drive, since it can't discharge it into the ground.A static discharge strap that connects your car to the road can solve this problem.


Very old vintage cars may use plain white rubber tires, which have the same problem.
Ordinary tires are treated with carbon black, a conductive material.A grounding strap makes no difference for cars with these tires. (Shocks can still happen, but the charge difference is between you and the car, not the car and the ground.)

Park near an identifying landmark.,
Park away from the crowds.,
Notice where you park.,
Remember what row you parked in.,
Say it out loud.,
Write it down.,
Take a photo.,
Add identifying features to your car.,
Try your panic button.,
Search up and down rows.,
Get an app.,
If all else fails, ask workers, security personnel, or attendants to help you.

",How to Find Your Car in a Crowded Parking Lot," If you have a choice of where you park, choose something distinctive, such as a tree or lamppost, or the entrance of a particular store.;
, If there is any space left, it will be at the far edges of the lot, furthest from the building. If you park there, you will have fewer other cars around you obscuring your view.


Try to park on the end of a row or near a small car, motorcycle spot, ramp, or something else that's not a full sized parking space. It will be harder to find your car if it's hidden behind a large van or SUV by the time you return. These odd spaces can also help to serve as landmarks.

, In places like theme parks, often there are landmarks (signs, towers, lights, etc.) to help you remember where you've parked. Many parking structures mark floors, sections and even spaces. If you have cues like these, note them down and take the note with you, especially if you will be spending a long time inside wherever you are going.

, If you are about to enter a building, see if you can remember which row you were in, so afterward, all you have to do is walk down that row. If the rows are not marked, with numbers or letters, look for other landmarks: two rows over from the left-hand entrance and about two thirds of the way down the row.

, If you don't write it down, at least state out loud where you are parking, right as you pull in to park there. ""I am now parking midway down the row directly under the sign for the beauty parlor."" Putting it into words will remind you and any passengers to be conscious of your location.


When you go in to the store, note which department that you came in (e.g. furniture department, shoe department, etc). That little bit of extra attention to that detail will at least get you out of the right side of the building.
Go one further and make up a story or jingle about where you parked. Set your parking space to music. If it's a bad or silly tune, all the better. You'll be less likely to forget.

, Chances are you have a scrap of paper in your purse or pocket. You can also put a note in your phone or even text the information to yourself.

, Do you carry a digital camera or cell phone with a camera in it? Photograph your parked car with identifying landmarks, especially if you are in an unfamiliar place. It's an instant reminder, and you can delete the photo when you no longer need it.

, If you drive a silver Honda, you already know that lots of other people do, too. A colorful ribbon, flag, or antenna ball, bumper sticker, license plate frame, or even interior features such as seat covers or a stuffed animal in the back window can help you pick yours out of a crowd. If you want to use an antenna ornament, make sure your antenna is fixed.

, If you have a remote key fob that sets your alarm or horn off, try pressing it. Remember that most don't have a very good range. Be prepared to turn your alarm off again promptly, and don't do this in the middle of the night if there are residences around where people might be disturbed.

, Start walking up and down the rows, scanning for your car. Start at one edge of the area where you think it might be and be systematic about it.

, You can download apps that use your phone's GPS record your location and then lead you back to your car.

Examine the odometer for the number of miles.,
Ask the seller to show you the original title, not a duplicate.,
Ask to see oil change and maintenance receipts and inspection stickers.,
Look for missing screws on or near the dashboard.,
Inspect the brake pedal and floor mats.,
Take the vehicle to a mechanic and ask him to examine the car for wear and tear.,
Measure the depth of the tread on the car's tires.",How to Avoid Odometer Fraud,"


Automobiles average about 12,000 miles a year. For example, if a car is 5 years old but has far fewer than 60,000 miles, the odometer may have been tampered with.
Look closely at the numbers on the odometer. Some auto makers program odometers to show an asterisk if the mileage is changed.
General Motors mechanical odometers have a black space between the numbers. If you see a white or silver space, the GM odometer probably has been changed.;
, If the title is from out of state or brand new, it may be a case of title washing or title fraud, and the mileage given may be false.


Be sure to examine the title's mileage number closely and look for smudging or other tampering. The title should show the mileage in crisp type on a clean background.

, Examine the mileage on the receipts and inspection stickers and compare to the odometer. Inspection stickers can be found on door frames or windows.

, If the dashboard isn't put together perfectly, the odometer may have been tampered with.

, If either is badly worn but the odometer has low mileage, it may be a case of odometer fraud.

, A mechanic knows what parts would be original on an older car. For example, a car's odometer may say 30,000 miles. Beware if the car has new parts that ordinarily would not be replaced until 60,000 miles. This may indicate odometer tampering.

, If the odometer says 25,000 miles, the car should still have its original tires, with tread deeper than than 2/32 of an inch (1.5875 mm). Ask the mechanic to check tire tread with a depth gauge.


You can check tire tread depth yourself using a penny. Insert the penny into the tread upside down. If Abraham Lincoln's head is partly covered, the tire has more than 2/32 of an inch.

Decide how visible you want your tracker to be.,
Look for special features.,
Contact different car tracking companies.,
Try a local auto or electronics store.,
Check online stores.,
Check the warranty.,
Contact local car dealerships.",How to Choose a Car Tracking System," What you use the tracking system for will help you decide what features you'll want. Is this system to monitor teens using the family car? Do you want your tracking system for theft protection? Would you like to keep close tabs on the company car? Certain tracking systems will help you more than others, depending on your needs.

Be ethical with your car tracking usage. Using a car tracker without the driver's consent can be an invasion of privacy.Let others know your intentions.
If you're a delivery company, you can use car trackers so your customers can see the exact location of their item. Some car tracking systems will have software better equipped for this than others.;
, Knowing how tracking devices work will help you consider the pros and cons. Car tracking devices usually use a wireless transmitter, cellular technology, and/or a network of satellites orbiting around the world. By receiving information from these sources, the system can monitor its relative position.Using certain systems can have downsides. If you use a GPS tracker, your tracker will need a clear view of the sky to work, meaning that it can't calculate your car when below ground level.Cellular trackers will also have dead spots where they cannot send signals depending on which carrier you use.

, Car trackers will vary in price based on special features and brands. Set a budget for yourself before you shop so you avoid spending more than you can afford. You may feel lured into buying a more expensive tracker than you need if you don't research beforehand.

Some GPS trackers will require monthly fees or subscriptions, depending on the company you buy the tracker from. Factor this cost into your overall budget, and consider how much you'd be willing to spend long-term.

, Tracking devices vary in how and where they track your car. Some will provide real-time updates every minute, while others will provide updates every few hours. Inexpensive trackers only work once you notify the tracking company that your car has been stolen. Depending on your circumstances, one tracker might work better than another.

Accuracy and speed of your tracking system will greatly change the cost of a tracking system.
Consider how complex you want the tracking software to be. Expensive models will have more features but might be confusing to use.

, Cellular tracking systems are the most economical. The tracker uses cellular data to transmit location information to the device company or on the internet using supporting software. Usually, cellular systems are not real-time: instead, they update every thirty minutes to an hour.

You are also required to pay a monthly fee to avail service. Know that while Cellular systems are cheaper at first, the cost may add up over time.

, Wireless tracking systems generally require you to pay a one-time purchase and installation fee. The main disadvantage is that you can only access tracking information once the vehicle is stopped so you can upload the data.

If you want a tracker in case of emergencies, wireless systems are not useful. Install a cellular or satellite-based system if you want theft protection.

, Satellite-based GPS systems are costly and require monthly service fees. The benefit is accuracy: with satellites, you can have real-time updates where cellular companies won't cover.

Some trackers use a mix of satellite, wireless, and/or cellular systems. Consider a system that combines the benefits of several systems.

, Passive tracking systems store location, speed, and other information while on the road. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point (like your house), you can remove the device and download the information on your computer. Active tracking systems collect the same information but will transfer the information online in real-time.Many vehicles combine active and passive abilities: you might view its location in real-time and have an option to download speed, stops, and specific details after the vehicle has stopped.

, Covert tracking devices are often used for shipping companies, employers, or parents so their child or employee cannot remove the tracker. If you choose a more visible tracker, it will often be more affordable.

If you choose a less visible model, make sure you choose one with an extended battery life so you remove and reinstall it less often.

, Certain car trackers come with special features. You may want a model that can double as a car navigation system, especially if you choose a GPS device. Other car trackers double as alarms and will alert the tracking company if it is stolen. The more benefits a tracking system has, the pricier it will be., If you're buying a tracker with monthly fees or theft alert systems, call or email different tracking companies. Ask them what deals they have and what monthly costs you will have to pay., Visit a local electronics store or auto shop and chat with the employees about different models. Even if you don't buy your device there, they can help you find the ideal model based on your needs.

Visit a local retailer even if you want to buy online to try out a few different models.
Ask about the store's return policies. You may realize a certain tracker doesn't work for you after a few days.

, Visit websites or auction sites, which often have deals on electronics. Research the website before you buy to make sure the site is reputable. Some websites might offer an item for a low price but offer low-quality items or scam buyers out of their money.

If you want to buy your tracker used, look at local classifieds online. Ask the seller lots of questions about its condition and how the tracker works. Always meet the seller in-person to avoid getting scammed., Most device manufacturers will offer a warranty for their car trackers. If your tracker accidentally breaks, you'll want the reassurance a warranty gives. If you buy your tracker used, know that you most likely will not receive warranty coverage.Some stores may offer additional warranty coverage for an extra price. Ask retailer employees about warranty options and decide what works best for you.

, If you're looking for a new car, consider buying a car with a built-in tracking system. Visit car dealerships and ask salesmen about models that offer tracking systems and the benefits of different models.

Ask the employees if you can try the model out before you buy it. Some retailers will let you drive around and see how the tracker works.

Try a mechanical immobilizer.,
Consider an electronic immobilizer.,
Install a ""Kill Switch."",
Invest in a car alarm.,
Try VIN Etching.,
Install a vehicle tracking system.",How to Choose the Best Anti Theft Devices to Protect Your Car," These are the least expensive car anti-theft devices, designed to restrict access to or movement of the vehicle. The biggest advantage of mechanical immobilizers is their highly visual appearance, which should ward off amateur car thieves, but not the pros. Police authorities recommend including one of these in conjunction with other anti-theft devices.



Steering-Wheel Lock: “The Club” is the most popular steering wheel lock, and the least expensive anti-theft option. This device goes over the steering wheel and locks it in place, so no one can drive it until they remove the lock. Price Range: Low End: $25, High End: $100







Hood Lock: This device will block access to the battery and deter thieves who sell cars off for parts. Price Range: Low End: $20, High End: $50







Tire Lock: These deterrents are highly visible and hard to get off. (Again, I know you’ve seen car ""boots"" used by law enforcement on illegally parked cars on the “Parking Wars” TV show.) Since tire locks take time and effort to attach and remove, these would not be my first choice for your daily driver vehicle. Price Range: Low End: $80, High End: $200







Other Car Anti-Theft Options: Gearshift locks, ignition/steering wheel column and crook locks, gear shifter locks and brake pedal locks.





;
, Many modern vehicles come standard with car keys and fobs that protect their cars via electronic immobilizers. These built-in transponders or microchips send signals to the anti-theft system, which then send a signal that it's ok to start the car. When anyone attempts to use the car without these signals, the car will not start. Car thieves often avoid cars with electronic immobilizers.

, This anti-theft device can be activated to shut down part of the engine's electrical system. (You may have seen them used in “bait cars” on the “COPS” TV show.) Some cars have them built in, and they are pretty easy to install. Price Range: Low End: $10, High End: $200


A popular model is the Master Lock Starter Sentry, which kills the fuel or ignition system via a wireless transmitter.
Other ignition kill switches are activated the moment a car is locked and cannot be deactivated until a series of tasks are completed (i.e., unlocking the car, pressing the gas pedal once, buckling your seat belt, etc.).
Always check your car's warranty first, because some don’t allow installation, and remember to hide the Kill Switch, so a thief won’t see and disable it.

, These are the most visually effective anti-theft devices. Sometimes drawing a potential thief’s attention to the fact that your car has an alarm system is enough to deter them. So, be sure to put a sticker in the window, on both sides, proudly proclaiming you have a car security system activated. Car alarms feature electronic sensors designed to activate when a vehicle is breached: unauthorized entry, breaking of glass, sudden movement, and perimeter violations. When a threat is detected by the sensors, a siren activates (at over 120 dBs), alerting the car’s driver and everyone else within earshot. Price Range: Low End: $150, High End: $1,000


Be wary of older, cheaper car alarms, flexible-circuit alarms, and single-stage sirens, which are too easily triggered, and may come at the expense of your neighbors' friendship.
Always hook your car alarm up to a backup battery and/or invest in a hood lock. Many car thieves know how to unplug a car alarm’s battery, which will silence it.
Even if you don't have a car alarm, you can buy & apply stickers proclaiming your vehicle is protected by an alarm. The thought of a security system should make any thief choose another victim!

, Every vehicle has a unique, 17-digit serial number assigned to it called the Vehicle Identification Number or VIN. The VIN will be on the car’s title, on the dashboard (driver-side), and on your insurance and registration cards. You can “brand” your car’s parts by etching it’s VIN number on all windows and all important parts. Doing this serves as both a tracking device and a theft deterrent. Most car thieves steer clear of etched vehicles because of the expense in replacing and disposing of VIN-coded glass. Price Range: DIY kits sell for $20, or you can hire a professional to do this for you.

, This is the “Cadillac” of auto theft protection, so be prepared to pay top dollar. Electronic tracking devices offer a real-time location of the stolen vehicle using Global Positioning Systems (GPS). These are sold with service contracts, and have a reputation for relocating many vehicles a mere hour after they have been stolen. Price Range: Low End: $295, High End: $1395 (for car alarm & tracking system)


The two biggest companies are LoJack and OnStar. LoJack features a hidden transmitter in the car, which is activated once a theft is reported. This company works directly with law enforcement, and boasts a 90 percent return rate on stolen vehicles. OnStar offers a similar system, which comes standard on all new model cars from GM, Acura, Audi, Isuzu and Volkswagen.

Find the vehicle identification number (VIN).,
Check that the VIN hasn’t been tampered with.The entire VIN label should be securely fastened to the vehicle without any loose corners.,
Search the VINCheck website.,
Report fraud.,
Contact your insurer.,
Perform a title search.You can perform a title search by contacting your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or an equivalent office and provide the car’s VIN.,
Ask your mechanic to inspect the vehicle.,
Review the car’s service records.,
Proceed cautiously if the seller uses a cell phone.,
Be careful of cars advertised online or in the newspaper.Although many legitimate sales occur this way, most stolen vehicles are also advertised online or in the newspaper.,
Demand a bill of sale.,
Be wary of any deal that is too good to be true.If you’re shocked at what a great deal you’re getting, then chances are something is amiss.",How to Check if a Car Is Stolen," Every car has a VIN, which you should check so that you can perform a search. The VIN is made up of 17 characters and is like the car’s Social Security Number. Don’t just accept whatever VIN the seller gives you. Instead, thoroughly inspect the vehicle yourself to find the VIN.You can find the VIN in the following places:lower-left corner of the dashboard in front of the steering wheel
inside the driver-side doorjamb
in the rear wheel well directly above the tire
in the front of the car frame, near the container that holds windshield washer fluid
the front of the engine block
underneath the spare tire;
, Also check for scratches, tears, or gouge marks.


Also run your fingers over the VIN label. It should be smooth to the touch.If it is scratchy, then it may have been tampered with.
The VIN label should not be obscured with a screw or plug. If so, the owner might be trying to hide the VIN.

, The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) has a VINCheck database which collects the VINs for vehicles reported as stolen.Enter the VIN at the NICB website. You can perform five searches within 24 hours.

, If the vehicle has been stolen, call the police and report the vehicle. In the U.S., you should call the NICB at 800-835-6422 or submit an anonymous tip to TIP411.You can also call your local police. Share as many details about the seller as you can: name, address, and appearance.

, Your insurer has their own database which you can ask them to check for possible clones.Car cloning occurs when the thief pries the VIN plate off the stolen car and replaces it with a different one. The new VIN is often stolen from another car., The report should list whether the car was ever salvaged or declared as a total loss by an insurance company.It costs money to run a title search, so contact the DMV ahead of time to check the price and acceptable methods of payment.
Make sure the seller’s information matches the information on the title.If there’s a discrepancy, then the car was probably stolen.

, Your mechanic might be able to spot that the VIN has been tampered with.Furthermore, your mechanic can check the overall condition of the car so that you aren’t buying a clunker. Don’t buy a used car without having your mechanic look at it.

, The car’s VIN should also appear on service records, which the owner might share with you. Make sure the VIN on the service records matches the VIN on the car. If not, then the car has probably been stolen.


Of course, the car’s owner might fudge service records to hide the fact that the car has been stolen. Accordingly, you might want to order your own copy of the service records through Carfax or AutoCheck for under $100. You’ll need the VIN.When you get the reports, compare the description of the car in the service reports with the car you want to buy.

, Thieves move around a lot, so they prefer to do business using a cell phone. They also probably don’t have a fixed address, either.When you go to look at the car, ask the seller where they live and work. If they hesitate, then you may be buying a stolen car.

, It’s always better to buy from a reputable dealer or from someone you know personally.


Check a dealer’s reputation at the Better Business Bureau website.

, You want some sort of document that establishes you bought the car. If the seller hesitates to give this to you, then you should walk away. Typically, you’ll want a bill of sale, which should include the following information:car’s make, model, and year
VIN
seller’s name and address
your name and address
amount of the sale
seller’s signature and date

, Ask questions about why the seller is trying to sell the vehicle so cheaply. If the story doesn’t add up, then walk away.

Obtain a vehicle history report.,
Look for fender and bumper cracks.,
Check the windshield.,
Assess the car's body lines.,
Examine panel and door gaps.,
Feel the body for filler spots.,
Check for clamp marks.,
Look for repainting.",How to Check Cars for Accident Damage,"


Use a vehicle history research company like Carfax to get a full report on the car's history. This file will contain a list of all past owners, insurance information and any accident reports or claims filed involving the vehicle. This will help you know what kind of damage to look for when physically inspecting the car.;
,


Examine both ends of the vehicle and look for any cracks or patched areas. Fenders and bumpers break easily in a collision because they are often made of lightweight or plastic composite material. Breakage or repairs to the fender or bumper is a good indicator of further car accident damage.

,


Look at all windows and the front and back windshields of the car to check for vehicle accident damage. Note any chips, cracks or webbing. This could indicate that the car was involved in a collision and these areas will definitely require repairs.







,


Crouch down at one end of the car so you're eye level with the body of the car. Look along the main line down the side of the car's body. This line should be straight and even and the car's paint should reflect normally. An uneven line or distorted reflection indicates that body panels of the car have been replaced or hammered out due to body damage.

,


Look at the gaps between each door and the adjoining body panel. The gaps should be straight and an even width from top to bottom. A car that has had auto accident damage will have uneven gaps due to misalignment or replaced panels or doors.

,


Run the palm of your hand down the body panels of the car and around the corners of the fender and bumper. A car with accident damage will have bumps or uneven spots from filler used to repair damaged areas.







,


Clamp marks around the frame of the car indicate that the car has been on a frame machine, so the car has likely sustained damage that required major repairs to the car's body after an accident.

,


Look closely along the edges of the car's doors and body panels for any nicks, scratches or uneven paint areas. Signs of a different color paint underneath could mean that the car has been repainted after an accident or that a door or panel was replaced and repainted to match the rest of the car.

Even worse, you can run out of space to fit all of the pieces on your car. Run all of the ideas past a car expert before making any financial commitments to them.;
, If all you're looking for is a better look, you might find a paint job does everything you want it to. Cars can be painted with specialized spray paint in your garage. Due to the value of your vehicle, it's very important to be slow and consistent with your paint.


If you're painting the car from home, don't forget to give your car a primer coat beforehand.Car modification garages can offer more intense paint jobs with graphics like flames. These are very stylized, but make sure your car model is worthy of the flair before you commit to something so flashy. Graphic flames on a Toyota Camry won't get you the sort of attention you're looking for.

, Tinted windows add fast class to a vehicle. The mystery factor and privacy of tinted windows can make even an average car look posh by comparison.


By replacing factory parts, you may void your vehicle's warranty. Check with the manufacturer before proceeding.

, Changing them for a snazzier design is relatively inexpensive by car mod standards. The subtle difference it makes to your vehicle's appearance won't go unnoticed by those who know where to look.


Make sure your taillight modifications are road-friendly. Although you can change your car's look by replacing the lights on it, you still want to make sure they comply with road regulations.

, While a lot of car modification focuses on the outside presentation, you can revamp your experience on the vehicle by changing the seating. Most stock car seating is cloth-upholstered. For a fashionable touch, replacing this with leather seats is very luxurious.


If you go with leather seating, make sure you take care to maintain it as leather demands.

, This is because car modders tend to have preferences for certain models over others, and more popular models will have a greater number of readymade options. Even a broken down beater can be souped up into something special if you have the money for it. If it's your first time pimping out a car however, you can make it easier on yourself by picking a mod-friendly vehicle to start with.


Look online for some examples of your car model being modded. Some car models will come up with lots of results, while others will draw a blank. The number of results will probably give you an idea whether your car is seen as mod-friendly or not.

, This can be done at a car modification garage. Even a slight drop can have a big effect on the look of your vehicle.


On the other hand, you can boost your suspension up for a more rugged look. This option is popular on trucks and SUVs.
There is a safety concern involved in lowering your car's suspension. Although it may look cool, you'll be sacrificing some of your car's handling in the process. Keep this in mind if you are considering lowering suspension. A faster-looking car doesn't necessarily mean a better one.

, Spoilers are meant to give your car the visual impression that it's fast enough to need some aerodynamic support. Of course, for all except the fastest race cars, spoilers are just for show.Even so, many gearheads find the look of a spoiler very appealing on a car. Depending on how common the add-on is to your model, your mechanic specialist may be able to direct you to a spoiler specially suited to the car you want modded.

, A stereo system doesn't change your car's appearance in any significant way, but a new subwoofer will be felt. If you have the money to spend upgrading your car, giving your stereo a facelift will give your vehicle the soundtrack to boot. Best of all, you can be as cheap or expensive as you'd like with reinventing your sound system. A new pair of front speakers might only set you back $50, while a full-blown stereo system can cost you thousands of dollars.


Bass isn't everything to a stereo system. A rich sound will give you more listening enjoyment than a rig with all its power on the bass end of the spectrum.
Don't be inconsiderate by blasting your subwoofer in crowded areas.

, Hydraulics are a theatrical twist on your car. With hydraulics, you can boost your car's suspension and make it ""dance"". Hydraulics are a big part of car modder culture, and are preferred on vehicles with low suspension, called low-riders. If you want a playful trick to your car, take it to a garage and get this specialized suspension control installed.


Hydraulic suspension is pricey, and many outside the car modding community associate it with gang culture.
If you're in with a car modding community, you might try joining a car hydraulics ""dance competition"".

, If you are interested in increasing the functionality of your vehicle, getting a higher-quality brand of tire for your vehicle can change your experience of driving it. This is an important trick whether you're a car modding or a ""casual"" car owner.


Keep your area's weather in mind when you pick out tires. Some tires are specially designed to function in rain or snow.
Generally speaking, the bigger your wheels are, the less responsive they'll be when you're driving.Try to strike a balance between form and function with your tires.

, These computers determine how much fuel is injected into the engine at different RPMs. If you want to get an added boost (and fuel economy) from your car, you can buy an input panel for your ECU and have it installed in your car. Although it's only recommended you change an ECU's default settings if you know what you're doing, you can squeeze some extra power out of your car just by improving the efficiency of parts you already have.


By cutting out fuel at precise times, you can make your car ""backfire"", shooting a burst of flame out the exhaust when you rev it. This is not recommended for street vehicles however, and should only be approached if you know what you're doing.

, Having you exhaust and muffler replaced with something more sleek can help improve the vehicle's efficiency. Some car modders also enjoy playing around with the sound a car makes. Removing a muffler will make your car sound considerably louder. While this might make the car sound faster, it's also inconsiderate to other people using the road.

, However, these erode with time. Replacing them with durable polyurethane may be a largely invisible improvement to your vehicle, but it can do wonders for a vehicle's handling if you've been driving it a while.

, Car modifications can affect your insurance premiums. It's best to look into the ways each modification may affect your insurance before committing to them. Talk to your insurance company if you're unclear., All the same you'll want to keep legality in mind while modding your car to make sure it's not taken away from you once you're on the road.


Legality will depend on the specific country you're living in. As a general rule, if your car looks more like it's designed for a racetrack, there's probably something about it that conflicts with regulation.

, At the end of the day, you should make sure you're keeping your car safe and useable. Even if something may look cool, nothing is worth putting your life and others in danger.

, Most tasteful mods will be received positively, while more bombastic changes might be seen as a joke by other street users. Make a point of avoiding inconsiderate mods. Removing your car's muffler vastly increases the noise pollution your car will create, and anything that creates excess smoke should be rightly avoided.

Look for imperfections to repair, such as dings, dents, holes and especially rust or corrosion that can eat through the new paint job.;
,,,


Use masking tape and paper to cover any areas of the car you do not want any paint on. If possible, include door jambs and trunk and hood lids, to avoid overspray getting into the interior, engine bay, or trunk.

,,,


If possible, arm yourself with separate guns for the different stages, to save time cleaning between stages and to avoid cross-contamination of colors and types of paint.

,


If possible, use full-spectrum lighting to ensure the light will show accurate color.

,


Overlap each pass by about 50% to ensure even coverage.

,


Watch for any body repairs or blemishes that may surface.

,,,,,,,


Because candy colors are translucent, like looking through hard candy, you will need to apply at least four coats. The color darkens as you layer it.. Pearl powder in candy paints intensifies or complement the color, depending on what color pearl you use. The color coat underneath will show through, with this candy color tinting it, and the pearl giving off an extra deep glow.
Overlap each pass by 75%.
Some professionals also elect to spray a clear coat between the base color and the candy color as added sealant.

Sand the paint either to the bare metal, the original primer, or at least sufficiently for the new paint to adhere to.,
Clean all surfaces thoroughly, using mineral spirits or denatured alcohol to make sure no oils (including body oils from fingers and hands) are on the car.
,
Use masking tape and paper to cover all surfaces not to be painted, including glass, window trim, door handles, mirrors, and grills.",How to Paint a Car1," You will need a place with excellent ventilation, minimal dust, good lighting, electricity, and lots of room to work around the vehicle. Residential garages are not usually suitable because of the presence of water heaters or furnaces that may cause ignition of paint fumes which can accumulate during the painting process.

, See ""Things You'll Need"" for a complete list, but here is a general outline:

Painting equipment
Paint
Sanding and polishing tools and supplies
Safety equipment

,, Much of the body panel moldings used on cars can be snapped off and snapped back on easily, but if a gentle attempt to remove it is not successful, do not try to force it off. Some stores sell tools that aid in the process of removing trim.
, How much you choose to sand is up to you, but the best results will require removing the paint down to bare metal, re-priming the surface with an automotive primer, and then applying your finish paint.
,, Make sure that there are no holes in the masking tape and paper that will allow overspray to get through.

Covering your garage with plastic is also a good idea to avoid permanently coloring the room

Prime the surface with a corrosion resistant, self-etching primer if you have removed all paint down to bare metal.,
Allow the primer to cure thoroughly.,
Sand all primed surfaces smooth.,
Clean the surface after priming to remove any dust or oil that has accumulated during priming.,
Spray the finish paint on the car.,
Allow the paint to fully cure.,
Finish sanding the car.,
Use a rubbing compound to polish the paint and begin to bring out a gloss.",How to Paint a Car2," Prime any surface you used body filler or removed rust from, feathering these areas to a smooth transition and applying enough paint to fill scratches or pits left in the preparation process.
, Check the information on the container. Primer curing times may differ, and some primers require recoating (applying finish paint) in a certain time period after application.
, Use a 600 grit wet/dry paper to smooth paint runs or drips smooth to the surface, being careful not to sand too far and exposing the metal again.
, Wipe it using a wax and grease remover or acetone.
, Prepare the paint for spraying according to manufacturer's directions. Automotive enamels and some polyurethanes give better results with a hardener or catalyst.

Make sure the paint is thinned correctly for the equipment you are using, but avoid over-thinning, which will decrease the gloss of the finished surface and can cause runs.

, When using a catalyst, your paint should be dry to touch in less than 24 hours with full cure taking as long as 7 days depending of the product. During the interval between beginning the painting process and tack free time, the car must remain free of dust.
, Use 1200 or finer grit wet sandpaper, and sand the finish coat of paint until it is perfectly smooth. Rinse any sanding residue from the surface and allow it to dry.

Clear-Coat may be used if desired to give a deeper, higher gloss look.
Clear-Coat may be sanded with 1500 grit wet sandpaper to remove small runs, dirt, and other minor imperfections.

, This step is best accomplished by hand, but buffing machines and power polishers are available that can make it much easier. Be cautious, as they can ruin a paint job if misused. It may be a good idea when using a machine to tape off the edges and buff them by hand.

",How to Make Your Car Look Like a VIP's Car," VIP styling generally begins with a large, rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan. In the U.S., Lexus and Infiniti sedans are the most popular platforms for VIP modification, but European imports such as Mercedes are growing more common, and even American cars are sometimes done up in VIP Style.


Unless you're a purist, the model of car isn't as important as how it looks. People are increasingly applying VIP styling to Kias, Scions, and even minivans, but you want a flawless car, not a beater.






VIP cars are traditionally black, white, grey or silver. Try to find an appropriate car in one of these colors or have it professionally painted one of these colors. If you're not too concerned about the constraints of tradition, you can choose any color you like.





;
, There are a couple of ways to lower the vehicle. Probably the most popular now is the use of air suspension, since many of the high-end models that are modified into VIP cars already come equipped with air suspension. Since factory air suspension won't allow you to lower the car enough, many enthusiasts install a special air control system. Coil overs can also attain the desired lowness. Try to minimize the distance between the wheel and the fender. Edit if you are a purist coil overs are the only way to go. A true VIP car uses coil overs only, and airbags are looked down on.

, The wheels are perhaps the most important characteristic of VIP styling. Oversize (18-20"") wheels are essential. Another almost-universal trait is that the wheels should be flush with the car's fenders, which requires a very low wheel offset (rear-wheel drive vehicles typically have a lower offset than front-wheel drive vehicles, but most VIP-styled cars have even lower offsets). Negative camber angle (the angle between the vertical axis of the wheel and the vertical axis of the vehicle, as viewed from the front or rear) is also very common. Wheels with large lips are common, but not essential.

, Tires are usually stretched dangerously thin on the wheels, as tire stretching (Hipari) allows a flush, or close to flush, wheel to fender fit. The idea is not to tuck the wheel into the fender but rather have the lip of the wheel as close to the fender's edge as possible. Only the tire is tucked in, while the wheel is emphasized.

, VIP-style cars should be not only low, but also wide. A body kit can enhance both of these features. Add a body kit that emphasizes the car's lines while adding presence. Go all out with a full aero kit, or, at the very least add a lip kit.

, VIP style exudes luxury inside and out. Curtains on the windows are very popular, as are custom leather seats, floor mats (fur, anyone?), an accessorized dash, custom lighting and wood grain trim throughout. Tint the windows in either green or black to keep prying eyes out.

, A VIP-style car without a quality system just won't do. While a trunk full of subs is a good start, focus also on fitting your car with video and audio accessories to give it all the comforts of home. From electronic gauges to a DVD player to a navigation system, screens and monitors give the car the look of the luxury spaceship.

, While there are certain conventions that should be followed when modifying in VIP style, there's plenty of room for your individual tastes. From custom taillights to interior accessories, there are plenty of options to set your car apart from the rest.

Make simple adjustments to maximize fuel economy and power.,
Install a cold air intake.,
Purchase a higher flowing exhaust.,
Reprogram your engine control unit.,
Swap your tires for high performance alternatives.,
Replace your spark plugs.",How to Modify Your Car for Better Performance1," Modifying your car to increase its performance will do you very little good if you fail to stay on top of the required maintenance that keeps your car running smoothly. By changing your oil regularly, ensuring your tires are properly inflated, and following the recommended schedule of service for your vehicle, you can make your vehicle perform better and last longer. Check your vehicle’s owner manual for recommended service at different mileage points. Some cars may require timing belt or chain adjustments or fluid changes at specific mileage markers to ensure the vehicle continues to run as it was designed.Professional “tune ups” that include air and fuel filter changes, spark plugs, and even transmission fluid and filter changes are a great way to keep your vehicle running properly.
Ensure your tires are inflated to their recommended pressure to improve fuel economy and extend the life of the tire.;
, Think of your car as an athlete running a race; the intake on your car is the way it breathes in as it runs. Stock intakes are designed for a number of purposes that include things like reducing engine noise. By replacing your stock intake pipe with one that was designed to maximize power, you will not only increase horsepower, but fuel efficiency as well. Cold air intakes often have a larger diameter than the stock pipe and are designed to take the most direct route to the throttle body as possible.Cold air intakes usually include an aftermarket air filter that increases the filter surface. This allows for more air to travel through it at a higher volume.
Some cold air intakes even include heat shielding to prevent the engine temperature from warming the air as it travels into the engine.
The cooler the air, the denser it is with oxygen, allowing for a hotter burn which creates more horsepower.

, If the intake is how an athlete (your car) breathes in as it runs, the exhaust is how it breathes back out. There are a number of options available to you when it comes to installing higher flowing exhausts. Many people opt to install a catalyst-back aftermarket exhaust, which replaces the piping from your catalytic converter(s) to the muffler. Higher flowing catalytic converters, front pipes and even exhaust manifolds are all also common modifications. Replacing the entire exhaust system (from exhaust manifold to muffler) will maximize the performance of your engine.Larger diameter, higher flowing exhaust systems have a more significant effect on turbocharged vehicles. The increased exhaust flow also serves to increase the efficiency of the turbocharger.
Some states have strict regulations about replacing your catalytic converters. Check on the website of your local Department of Motor Vehicles prior to modifying or replacing your catalytic converter.

, The engine control unit (ECU) in modern cars keeps the engine running smoothly. The ECU adjusts the air/fuel ratio of your engine to keep things consistent regardless of air density (altitude) and temperature. If your engine begins to run lean (too much oxygen), the ECU will add fuel to the mixture to re-achieve balance, and vice versa if the engine starts to run rich (too much fuel). The ratio the ECU maintains is established at the factory and based on a number of factors such as reducing emissions and increasing reliability. By using a programmer or taking your car to a performance shop to have your ECU flashed with a new program that prioritizes performance, you can free up power and even increase gas mileage.Some vehicles can be reprogrammed through their OBDII ports using programmers you can buy for your specific vehicle or “chips” you can install.
Higher end models of these programmers allow you to utilize more than one program or profile. This allows you to switch between air/fuel ratios that prioritize performance, gas mileage, or even using lower octane fuel.

, Tires are extremely important to the performance of your car. Good traction determines your car’s ability to put the power it produces to the ground; it’s the difference between getting a good launch and burning your tires at the starting line. Most people choose performance tires designed with a compromise between maximizing the tire’s “footprint” and allowing for water displacing tread.Pay attention to the speed rating on the tires you purchase. The rating is usually a single letter that refers to the maximum speed the tire is rated for. Most cars come with “S” rated tires that are safe up to 112 miles per hour. Many performance tires carry a “Z” rating, which is rated for speeds in excess of 149 miles per hour.Some high performance tires produce more ride noise than their stock alternatives.

, Spark plugs produce the electrical spark that ignites the mixture of air and fuel in each cylinder of your engine. Over time, they can wear out or become ruined by unfavorable running conditions such as running too lean or rich. Compromised spark plugs have limited ability to ignite the air/fuel mixture, which may result in the engine misfiring. There are many different options when it comes to spark plugs, so do some research or consult the clerk at your local auto parts store when choosing spark plugs to install in your engine. Spark plugs should be replaced at regular intervals as a part of your normal vehicle maintenance to ensure they don’t corrode or fail.Some spark plugs are made from different materials: copper conducts best but has to be replaced far more often due to corrosion, so many people choose iridium plugs for performance applications as they conduct nearly as well and last much longer.
Make sure you consult your car’s repair manual when gapping your spark plugs before you install them. The gap on the spark plug is the distance the spark needs to arc from one piece of the plug to another. An incorrect gap height can compromise the plug’s ability to ignite the air fuel mixture.

Replace your shocks and springs with higher performance alternatives.,
Install larger anti-roll bars.,
Swap rubber bushings with polyurethane.,
Install a strut tower bar.,
Upgrade your brakes.",How to Modify Your Car for Better Performance2," The shocks and springs in the suspension of your car were designed and built with your comfort in mind. In order to maximize comfort, the suspension allows the wheels to move up and down to limit how much the body of the car is affected by bumps. Replacing these components with stiffer shocks and springs will compromise some of your ride comfort, but the added stiffness will keep the tires in contact with the road better, thus improving traction when accelerating, braking, or turning.Coil-Overs are adjustable shocks and springs that allow you to lower the vehicle and stiffen the ride based on your preference and driving style.
Many stiffer suspensions also lower the vehicle, which lowers its center of gravity and also serves to improve handling.

, Anti-roll bars cross the undercarriage of your car at the front and rear to connect the sides of the body and increase the structural rigidity of your car. Swapping out the stock anti-roll bars with larger diameter replacements will increase the rigidity of your car’s body even further. This increased stiffness helps to ensure the tires remain as flat as possible on the ground to maintain good traction. When buying anti-roll bars, it’s best to purchase them in pairs so the front and back offer the same level of torsional strength and don’t permit your car to twist under the torque of hard launches or sharp turns.Anti-roll bars are also referred to as sway bars, anti-sway bars, stabilizer bars or roll bars.
High strength tubular steel is often a better alternative to solid bars, which can be extremely heavy.

, Your suspension has a number of bushings separating moving metal parts, reducing vibrations and helping to maintain your car’s weight distribution. Unfortunately, the rubber these bushings are made of tends to break down over time. Polyurethane replacement bushings are much stiffer than their rubber counterparts and won’t wear down the way stock ones will.Polyurethane bushings will make loud squeaking noises if not properly greased when installed.
Bushings can be replaced one by one or kits can be purchased to replace all of your bushings at once.
Some bushings may require the use of a press to remove from their housings.

, Strut tower bars connect the right and left side of your car in much the same way anti-roll bars do, but they are installed on the top of the car under the hood and trunk lid. These bars directly connect the driver’s and passenger’s side struts, increasing the structural rigidity of the car and aiding in efforts to keep the tires as flat on the pavement as possible during aggressive driving. These bars make an excellent addition to after-market anti-roll bars to reduce the amount your car leans and twists while turning.You may not be able to access the rear strut towers to install a bar in the back of some cars.
Strut tower bars may need to be removed when working on the engine of your car in the future.

, One could argue that being able to stop is the most important part of any car’s performance. The better quality your brakes, the longer you can wait to engage them before a turn, which means maintaining a higher rate of speed longer than your competitors. You have lots of options when it comes to upgrading your brakes, from purchasing better brake pads to replacing the entire system with larger, heavier duty components.Aftermarket brake pads are designed to improve your car’s ability to stop. They use the stock brake components and are a great option for most street applications.
Different brake pad compounds are designed for different uses. Ask your local auto parts store about the options available for your specific car.
Kits can be purchased to replace your car’s brake calipers and rotors with larger ones, increasing the friction surface of the brake pad and improving your ability to stop. It’s important to ensure your wheels are large enough to clear big brake upgrades.

Install a turbocharger kit.,
Supercharge your car.,
Add a “dry” nitrous kit to your car.,
Install a wet nitrous kit in your car.",How to Modify Your Car for Better Performance3," Turbochargers are basically air pumps that are powered by the exhaust gas exiting your engine. The exhaust exiting your engine spins a turbine, which transfers that energy through a driveshaft to a turbine on the other side that sucks in and compresses air into your engine’s intake. In effect, a turbocharger forces more air into the engine than it could possibly take in through normal aspiration. Most turbocharger kits include higher volume fuel pumps, ECU programmers, higher flow fuel pressure regulators and even fuel injectors. Turbocharger kits should be purchased for your specific car unless you are an experienced mechanic.Many turbocharged cars have intercoolers installed between the turbocharger and the car’s intake to cool the air and increase its density.
Turbocharging your car requires extensive tuning of the air/fuel ratio that may be best left to professionals.

, Centrifugal superchargers and turbochargers work in very similar ways. While a turbocharger is powered by the exhaust leaving the engine, superchargers are belt driven like your car’s power steering pump or air conditioner. Being belt driven means superchargers aren’t as efficient as turbochargers, but they don’t have to wait to be spooled by the exhaust. Because of this distinction, many people prefer superchargers for their more consistent distribution of power. Installing a supercharger kit involves most of the same modifications required for turbochargers in terms of fuel.Roots style superchargers do not mount in the same way but are still belt driven. These superchargers are traditionally found on older model, carbureted engines.
On forced induction applications like supercharged cars, you should use a higher octane fuel to increase the stability of the air/fuel mixture in the engine.

, Nitrous oxide is a gas that contains more oxygen than the regular air found in the atmosphere. As a result, adding nitrous oxide to the air traveling through your car’s intake serves a similar purpose to forcing more air into it with a turbocharger or supercharger. Instead of forcing more air into the engine mechanically, nitrous oxide introduces more molecules of oxygen into the same amount of space regular air would normally occupy. Nitrous kits that do not mix the nitrous oxide with fuel when injected are referred to as “dry.” These kits are designed to add a smaller amount of power as compared to wet kits, but can be an extremely cost effective method of giving your car a quick horsepower boost.Nitrous oxide kits only affect power output when they are in use, reducing the wear and tear on your engine as compared to consistent power adders like turbochargers and superchargers.
After turning on your nitrous kit, you usually control the spray of nitrous with a button or throttle switch that activates when you press the pedal to the floor.
Some dry nitrous kits use the fuel pressure regulator to increase fuel pressure going into the engine to compensate for the added oxygen, while some others do not.

, Wet nitrous oxide kits serve the same basic function as their dry counterparts, but they mix fuel directly with the nitrous as it is injected into the engine. As a result, wet nitrous kits are often considered to be safer for your engine, as the air/fuel ratio you choose is maintained even with the addition of the nitrous oxide. This stability allows for wet nitrous kits to add even more horsepower than dry kits with relatively low risk of pre-detonation. Like turbochargers and superchargers, properly utilizing nitrous oxide in your car might require custom tuning that may be beyond most hobby mechanics.Wet nitrous oxide kits are usually engaged using buttons just like dry kits.
Nitrous oxide is not flammable on its own like movies might have you believe. It must be mixed with a fuel to burn.
Nitrous oxide kits can be used in conjunction with a turbocharger or supercharger.

Make the vehicle as light as possible.,
Install a high-flow air filter and intake system.,
Upgrade to a performance exhaust system with test piping.",How to Max Your Car's Horsepower1," The simplest and cheapest way you can get the most efficiency and power out of your engine is by giving it the least amount of car to power. Even dropping 20 pounds will help you accelerate faster. Remove excess junk from your trunk and cab, and consider making extra modifications that will lighten your load:


Remove the rear seats, which can weigh up to a hundred pounds in some models.
Use lightweight wheels instead of steel, with high performance tires. This can help you drop up to 50 pounds.
Use carbon fiber or fiberglass body panels instead of the manufacturer panels. This is a more complex modification, but if you're trying to find your engine's max and make the vehicle lighter, it's a possibility.;
, Changing out the air-filter to a higher performance variety can add a few horsepower cheaply and quickly to your engine. You won't have to buy new air filters, and you'll allow your engine to breathe better, adding a small amount of power. For about $40 – $250 for most applications, this is an excellent place to start.


AEM dryflow air filters never need any oil added and are legal everywhere.K&N Air Filters are good for for 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km), and can add five horsepower or more depending on vehicle.
Cold-air or ram-air intake systems draw in air from a cooler place outside the vehicle. Some cars will benefit greatly, and some will not. Usually, higher-end cars will not be able to benefit from this, as they already have a well-designed air intake system.
Before making any filter modifications or using a high-performance system you get from the Internet, research the laws in your state regarding filter regulations. Some high-flow filters aren't legal in all 50 states.

, Ideally, a ""header-back"" exhaust system will be installed, in which the exhaust goes pretty much straight from the engine to the tailpipe, efficiently and quickly. Kits are available, should you choose to do it yourself, for several hundred dollars, though welding a new exhaust system onto the car requires that you have access to a shop with a hydraulic lift, the replacement system, the welding gear, and the know-how. It's usually better to have a muffler shop that knows what they're doing upgrade your exhaust system for a fee.


I-4 engines should go up to 2.5 exhaust, unless a turbocharger is equipped, then 3"" is acceptable. V6/V8 cars should have 2.5""-3"" exhaust all the way through.

Exhaust headers are expensive and will add only a small power gain. It's a good option, but only if you've exhausted most other HP-maxing opportunities available.

Consider installing a performance camshaft.,
Research your turbocharging, supercharging and Nitrous options.,
Install a water-injection or anti-detonant injection kit.",How to Max Your Car's Horsepower2," Performance cams increase the duration and timing of the valve openings during the engine stroke, increasing horsepower and making your car accelerate more quickly. You'll idle slightly rougher with a performance cam, but get a throaty rumble that's desirable for some gearheads, depending on your vehicle. They're on the expensive side, but work well in conjunction with header or exhaust upgrades.



To install a new camshaft, you must expose the valve train by removing the valve cover and possibility the distributor. Loosen and remove the timing chain and the old camshaft to install the new version. Adjust the timing and tweak the new cams as necessary.

, A turbocharger can add up to 25 – 30% power gains. However, turbocharger kits cost about $3,000 for common applications, and go up in price for less common applications. Turbochargers are excellent for any car, anywhere, but can be prohibitively expensive, and are difficult to install for novice mechanics. Research which systems and options would be effective for your model and weigh your options.



Turbochargers suck air into the engine, increasing boost and horsepower. An intercooler will also need to be installed with a turbocharger to avoid turbo-lag, in which the engine overheats and slows the impeller.Superchargers are belt-driven, making them more effective for 6+ cylinder engines. While a turbocharger results in a higher peak of HP, superchargers don't require the use of an intercooler, and result in fewer heating problems and maintenance issues. They're available in centrifugal, screw, and roots-type models, depending on the kind of engine.

Nitrous is power in a bottle, Nitrous is an oxidizer (like adding more air), couple that with some more fuel and you make power. Kits cost from $900 - 3000 for any application. Basic kits are easy to install with high performance kits needing some skill sets. Power gains can be anywhere from 5Hp to 1000Bhp over the whole rpm range. Unlike Turbo's and Superchargers if you change your vehicle you can take your kit from one vehicle to another so you don't lose your investment. Nitrous will also work with Turbocharging and Supercharging to reduce lag and increase top end so can be combined to make more power. Most vehicles will take a good increase in standard bhp around 25-50% more without modification. Higher levels may need improvement of ancillaries and eventually internals.

, For $300, a good water-injection kit increases gas mileage and power while reducing carbon deposits within the combustion chambers, preventing engine pinging. Most of the time, having such a system installed will even let you buy lower-octane fuel. While water-injection kits will have almost no performance gains on naturally-aspirated engines, they can help restore lost power. Turbo or supercharged engines will have massive power gains with water-injection.

Drive the vehicle to seat the springs.",How to Install Lowering Springs," There are two factors to consider when buying your springs. The first is how much you are willing to spend. Better (lower) springs can be more expensive. Second, decide how much you want to lower your car. Some springs can lower a vehicle as much as 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).This might not sound like much, but it is a considerable amount for a single small modification such as springs.


Lowering springs are made to replace coil springs and are not the same as a coilover design.;
, It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.

, Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:


Your service manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.

, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.

, You will need to support this part during the disassembly. Otherwise it may fall abruptly during disassembly and cause harm to yourself and/or the vehicle., The sway bar serves to keep the weight of the vehicle from shifting too much during cornering. It is attached to the lower control arm with bolts that will need to be removed. If the bolts are stuck, try using WD-40 and letting it set before trying to turn them.Once you have removed the bolts, move the sway bar away from the lower control arm. There is no need to take it all the way off of the vehicle.

, Shock absorbers are often run through the center of the spring and will need to be removed to remove the spring. Remove the upper and lower mountings that connect the shock absorber to the A-arms. Pull it out through the lower A-arm., It is made to go inside the coils and hook onto the spring. Once it is hooked, you tighten the bolt on the spring compressor and it slowly compresses the spring and holds it., Once you have compressed the spring, you will need to check the top and bottom A-arms for any connecting bolts. If any are found, remove them., Use a ball joint separator to break the connection., Now that the components are all loose, slowly release the spring. Loosen the bolt on the spring compressor slowly. This will allow the spring to expand to its normal size and you can remove it from the vehicle. Take it out through the bottom instead of trying to pull it out through the top., Remove any accessories such as insulators that are attached to the spring., Compress the new spring with the spring compressor. Just as with the old spring, latch the hooks of the spring compressor onto the spring and turn the bolt. This will apply the needed pressure to compress the spring.

, Install any accessories that were removed from the old spring onto the new one before installing the spring. This might include boots or gaskets.

, Since lowering springs are made to work with your factory suspension, you will just put the new lowering spring in the same place as the old coil spring. Fasten it in the same way as the old coil spring before reattaching other hardware.

, With the control arm held in place, you will be able to properly align the suspension components that you unhooked during disassembly., This needs to be done before decompressing the spring. Once the spring is decompressed, it will be its full length and will be in your way for this step.

, Unscrew the bolt slowly to release the tension held on the spring.This allows the spring to expand to its full decompressed size. It also slowly dissipates the potential energy contained in the compressed spring (which can be dangerous if released all at once).

, Put it back into place by going up through the lower A-arm. In many cases the shock absorber will fit through the center of the spring as well. Tighten the upper and lower mountings to the specified torque., Make sure to tighten the bolts to the specified torque. This will ensure that weight is distributed correctly during driving., You should slide the wheel back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheel in place while the car is still on the jackstands.

, Use the floor jack to lift the vehicle off of the jackstands. Remove the jackstands and lower the vehicle with the floor jack.

, Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual. Be sure to tighten lugs in a star pattern.

, This applies pressure to your newly installed springs and allows them to better fit into the other suspension components.You do not need to drive fast or far. The weight of the car will seat the springs quickly and you may not even notice.


If you notice your car’s handling is compromised, you should stop driving. If this happens, have your car checked by a professional to be sure that your installation was done correctly.

Remove the air intake system.,
Keep your original air intake.,
Install the new intake.,
Check to make sure the intake system is secured properly.,
Re-attach your battery terminals.,
Test drive your new intake!",How to Install an Aftermarket Air Intake," If you own a commonly customized car, such as a Honda Civic or a Volkswagen Jetta, you will likely need only your model, year, and engine type. If your car is less commonly modified, it may be harder to find aftermarket parts.;
,



Short-pipe intakes are the simplest design to install, but offer the least benefits in terms of horsepower, torque, and gas mileage. They pull hot air directly from within the engine compartment into the engine.

Cold air intakes pull cool air from places outside the engine compartment such as around the wheel well or bumper. These are a bit more complicated to install since you may have to install part of the intake from underneath the car. The cooler air is denser than the air inside the engine compartment so it gives a better boost to performance and gas mileage than short-pipe designs.

Ram-air intakes usually pull cool air from the bumper area. Because they are designed to be at the front of the car, they actually pressurize the cool air coming into the engine as the car moves faster. This provides maximum airflow and maximum benefits. It is also the most complicated to install since you will likely have to install part of the system from underneath the car. You may even have to remove your bumper., You should choose an area that has plenty of space for you to move around the front and sides of your vehicle. You also want a well-lit area so that you can see what you are doing. Be sure to turn your vehicle off before proceeding.

, Parts in the engine compartment can get very hot when the car is running.You do not want to get burned.

, Start by removing the negative terminal (black or unmarked) and then remove the positive terminal (red).

, This should be easy to identify. It will look like a large plastic tube running from the engine to a large plastic filter box.

, This consists of removing the air filter, the filter box, and the tube running from the filter box to the opening in the engine bay. Some of these parts will be attached to the engine bay by small plastic mounts. You will need a wrench or socket set to remove the small bolt holding the mounts in place. Some pieces of the intake system are fastened to each other with hose clamps, which can be loosened by turning the small bolt on the end with a screwdriver or socket.









You may need to remove one or more air sensors which feed information to the car's computer. These should be handled very delicately.

, If the new intake you purchased is damaged or doesn’t fit, you will have to re-install the original intake system before driving your car. Set the intake aside until you know the new one works properly.

, You should follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions as to which piece to install first. Be sure to secure the intake with hose clamps where appropriate. Carefully re-install any sensors removed with the old intake. Once the new intake is installed, install a new air filter.








Remember that if you purchased a cold air or ram air intake, you will likely need to climb under the car to complete the installation as these systems pull cool air from outside the engine compartment.

, If the intake easily strikes other objects in the engine bay, tighten the mountings until it is secure.








, You should attach the red (positive) terminal first. Next, attach the black (negative/ground) terminal.

, You want to make sure that the intake is functioning properly before you hit the open road.

, You can do this by using paint remover or by simply sanding all of it off the vehicle. If the paint is good, then you only need to sand it with 360 grit sandpaper. You should be down to bare metal when you are done.

, No exposed surface that you plan to paint should be left un-primed. Let the surface dry completely before you begin painting.

, You can use a painting prep solvent to remove any grease, wax or oils on it.

, Hold the sprayer 6"" – 10"" from the surface and spray in smooth and level strokes, overlapping strokes by about 50 percent. Check the paint manufacturer's instructions about drying times before sanding.

, This may not be a good idea for a metallic color because it could remove metallic flakes from the base coat.

, Let it dry completely before sanding. More than one coat may be needed to get full coverage on some metallic paints

Make a list of your favorite colors.,
Select a car make and model.,
Ask your dealer about color options for the make and model you want.,
Choose a color that will look good for the life of your car.,
Choose white or silver for a safe color.",How to Choose Car Paint Colors1," Be sure that you are thinking about what colors you like on cars and not on other things, like walls. Also, let the creative juices flow for now. There will be factors that narrow your choices, but a common insurance myth scares many car buyers. Rest assured, it is not true that insurance rates change at all based on a car’s color., The make and model of your car can greatly influence your choice of color. Many people wouldn’t choose the same color for a minivan as they would for a sports car. Mark any colors off of your list that you think wouldn’t suit the car you want to buy., Each make and model is available only in a certain variety of colors. Your dealer can tell you what color options they have for particular car. You can also do this research on your own ahead of time, but keep in mind that dealers typically keep neutral, safe colors.It is possible to special order a car. If you have the patience to wait for your car, you can order it in colors that the dealer does not have available., You want to make sure that the car you buy today is something you still want to drive a few years from now. Some colors come in style for a short period, and then they fade away. If you are driving one of these fad colors after it goes out of style, your car might be showing its age (and yours). Choose a color that will endure the test of time., Not only does your paint color affect how your car is perceived by other drivers, it also affects how your car is seen by other drivers. Having an easily visible car can possibly add an extra layer of safety to your driving experience. Drivers of silver cars are as much as 50% less likely to be harmed in an accident.Some colors also hide dirt better than others and boast a higher resale value than other colors (silver in particular does both).It is worth noting that white cars are also found to be in fewer accidents than other colors."

Match custom paint jobs to your car.,
Use your imagination.,
Consult a professional painter about your paint job.",How to Choose Car Paint Colors2," It is quite expensive to paint a whole car, and usually not worth it for an everyday driver. Most whole body paint jobs are the result of some kind of special customization or restore. With this in mind, you want to know a little bit about the car you intend to paint and make sure that you choose a color scheme that suits your car. often this means sticking with a vintage color ― something that might have been on the car when it was new. Other times, it means a color scheme that brings out the best features of the car, even if that color scheme was never an original from the manufacturer.An example of a paint job that isn’t likely to flow would be restoring a ‘69 Chevelle, having a supercharger sticking up out of the hood, and painting it pink with purple polka dots.

, The great thing about restoring or customizing a car is the opportunity to truly have whatever you want. The end result should be something you are proud of, so naturally it has to be something that you like. Envision exactly what you want your car to look like., Whether you know what you want or not, an open dialogue with the painter is never a bad idea. They can help steer you toward the paints that will give you the look your heart desires. A professional artist/painter can also help to expand on your ideas if you get stuck at any point."

Know where to get the color you want.,
Know what look you want.,
Consider less common paint options.,
Understand the pros and cons of different layering techniques.",How to Choose Car Paint Colors3," Paint basically falls into two very large categories. Factory paint is paint that comes standard on a particular model from the manufacturer. Custom paint is also just what it sounds like ― paint tailored specifically to your taste that is not available from the manufacturer., Three common paint options are solid colors, metallic colors, and pearl colors. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, solid colors can be cheaper and easier to apply evenly, but often look more plain. Metallic colors can be a bit more exciting, as they satisfy our lust for shiny things in a society fixated on technology, but light metallic colors can be quite difficult to apply. Pearls give a depth of color that solids nor metallics can match, but do not hide inconsistencies in the color very well., Two options that are seen on custom vehicles, but rarely on factory cars are candy color and chameleon paint. This is partly because candy colors are less durable than more common paints, and chameleon paints are quite difficult to apply evenly. That being said, candy colors are known for their superior depth of color (even compared to peal), and chameleon paints stand out in any crowd since the color changes depending on the viewer’s vantage point., You not only have the choice of what color to paint your car, you also get to choose what kind of paint to use. Single stage paints can be less expensive (you need less layers and less application time) and might be a good fit for solid colors. Two stage, or basecoat-clearcoat, paint applies the pigment (color) in the initial basecoat and then a glossy clearcoat is applied on top. This provides a great look and improved durability. Basecoat-clearcoat is almost always the best choice for metallic or pearl colors.Some pearls and metallics are actually applied as three-stage paints. The basecoat is applied first, and then the pearl or metallic finish is applied, and finally the clearcoat goes on last."

, This will help the paint adhere to the dashboard surface.

,, Try spraying 3 light coats of aerosol paint onto your dashboard.


If painting a dash with more than 1 color, you can also put painter's tape on parts of the dash painted in the first color that you want to protect before applying the second color.

, Remove any blue tape you put on the dashboard.

, This will prevent colored paint from the dashboard from getting on your fingers.

, Use small paintbrushes from a hobby or craft shop and canned car paint to do delicate or detailed work, such as lettering or a logo.

, These kits offer pieces of trim that can improve the look of wood dashboards and may be available for dashboards made of carbon fiber or other synthetic materials too. You may be able to paint over your kit's pieces or use a kit instead of paint.

Consider keeping an eye on a few cars with different prices to see how fast the cars sell. The ones that are in good condition but sell instantly could probably be priced a little higher, whereas the ones that sit for weeks and weeks without being sold most likely are too expensive.

, See how much they are asking for similar versions of your car. Keep in mind to always sell for lower than the dealers sell, as they can offer a buyer things that you can't, such as warranties., This is an online resource that will tell a close to exact price that your car is worth. Below are instructions for using Kelley Blue Book, both for used cars and new ones.

Understand the basics.,
Consider power.,
Consider semi-automatic transmission.,
Determine if fuel economy is an issue.,
Think about maintenance/repair costs.,
Identify your needs.,
Decide if you are willing to own a vehicle with a manual transmission.,
Notice if you are a multitasker.",How to Choose Between a Car with Automatic or Manual Transmission," Just like that of a manual transmission, the automatic transmission’s primary job is to allow the engine to operate in its narrow range of speeds while providing a wide range of output speeds. Without a transmission, cars would be limited to one gear ratio, and that ratio would have to be selected to allow the car to travel at the desired top speed.


If you wanted a top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h elsewhere), then the gear ratio would be similar to fourth gear in most manual transmission cars. You’ve probably never tried driving a manual transmission car using only fourth gear. If you did, you would quickly find out that you had almost no acceleration when starting out. A car like this would wear out very quickly and would not be drive-able.;
, If you want the most power from your engine, going with a manual transmission versus an automatic is most likely going to be your best bet. While some modern automatic transmissions, i.e. CVT transmissions, manumatics, and conventional 4 or 5-speed automatic transmissions allow for some excellent acceleration, there is still usually a substantial difference in 0-60 times between these types of automatics and a 5 or 6-speed manual transmission.


For example, an automatic equipped Dodge Neon has a reported 0 – 60 MPH time of approximately 10.5 seconds. The same Neon when equipped with a 5-speed manual has a reported 0 – 60 time of 8.1 seconds; a huge difference. While most cars do not have this large of a 0 – 60 MPH gap between auto and manual transmissions, 99 percent of the time you will receive noticeably better performance from a manual gearbox.
Acceleration with manual transmission is usually superior for a number of reasons, most predominantly gear ratios and the availability of more precise shifting. To explain, if you own a car that receives 200 horsepower at 7,000 RPM, but your automatic transmission will up-shift under full throttle at only 6,000 RPM, you probably will never feel the full amount of power that your engine was made to offer. So, your engine may be stamped with a 200 horsepower rating, but because your car is equipped with an automatic that up-shifts too soon, you may be missing up to 20% of available power. On the other side, with most manual transmissions, you can usually take the engine revs to the red line or past it. This enables you to get the most power possible to the front, rear, or all four wheels under full throttle take-offs.

, If you want a car for power, but someone also uses it for everyday, consider a semi-automatic transmission. These transmissions are called different names from one manufacturer to another. Usually, they're found on the sport models. Basically, they are an automatic transmission with the option to go manual. If you go into manual mode, it won't be the common gearshift with five options, but one with a + on the top and a - on the bottom. You push the shifter towards the + mark to shift up, and pull towards the - mark to downshift., If you answered yes, then going with a manual transmission is probably going to be your best bet, although it is far from your only choice. Many newer cars with automatics have an EPA rating of only 1 or 2 MPG less than the same model car equipped with the manual.


There are exceptions to this rule. Some vehicles get better mileage (5 mpg or more) as an automatic compared to the manual, most notably in Toyota's like RAV4, and the PT Cruiser. If this is the case, most people are not going to save a significant amount of money on fuel costs going with the 5-speed manual (especially if you do a lot of city driving). Since the majority of drivers do not manually shift for economy (or know how to), the 1 or 2 MPG that is lost with the automatic can easily be gained.
Check the EPA ratings (city and highway) of the car in question with both transmissions. EPA ratings are not always accurate, but they do give you a good idea on what type of fuel economy you will receive.

, Even though the automotive world has come extremely far with refining automatic transmissions, most automatic transmissions still need to be serviced far more often than manual transmissions (some auto manufacturers state that their manual transmissions never have to be serviced with fluid changes, etc. Manual transmissions are also usually slightly/much cheaper to fix when something mechanical goes haywire. This is not always the case, but on average, a manual transmission will cost you less to repair than an automatic in the same type of vehicle.


The clutch disc in manual transmissions does need to be replaced on occasion. There are many factors that determine how long a clutch will last such as driving style, the material the clutch disc is made of, and the amount of city vs. highway driving. Clutch replacement is often a labor intensive task and can cost several hundred dollars if performed at a repair shop.

, The engine that your car is equipped with makes a huge difference to which type of transmission should be chosen. To explain, if you are looking to buy a car with a 1.5 liter (0.4 US gal) 4-cylinder that pumps out 62 horsepower, and 75 lb/ft of torque you will most likely want/need to go with a manual transmission. Since power in this case is extremely limited, you will need to make the most out of your engine for hill climbing, passing power, etc. On the other hand, if you're looking to purchase a car with a V8 or V6 that offers plenty of power at both high and low revs, then going with a manual transmission is more of a preference than a necessity. While most drivers will still benefit in acceleration and fuel economy by going with a manual, it is not as detrimental as it would be with a car that was limited on power. Other things to consider:


An automatic transmission is better suited to starting out on a hill versus a manual transmission.
An newer vehicle with automatic transmission has more electronic controls than a car with manual transmission.

, Some people can't own a vehicle with a manual transmission for many reasons. They might be unwilling to learn to use one. They might have a physical handicap. They might need to share the car with someone who doesn't know how to operate a manual.


If this is the case, then search for an automatic that combines both good shift patterns and good fuel economy.
If you are willing to drive a manual transmission, there are a few features to look for. Manual transmissions all have their own unique shifting characteristics. Many are geared for fuel economy, others are geared for sport driving, and then there are many that offer the best of both worlds.

, Are you a multitasker that can do several things at once for an extended period? If you answered yes, then you qualify for a manual. If you answered no, then you do not. Manuals need you to concentrate on keeping your car on track, shifting the gears on time, and road hazards.


However, if you prefer to have your right hand available at all times to multitask then you will definitely prefer an automatic transmission. Bear in mind however that multitasking is, for a variety of reasons, very bad driving practice — not to mention illegal in a number of places.

Go buy yourself a car.,
Have a look through Car Magazines, Internet Searches and even Car Show Events, to see what other people have done.,
If you want your car be street drivable, ensure that every Mod you do is legal in your State or Country.,
Once the car is finished, take it to your local car show & start winning trophies!",How to Build a Showcar," Preferably one that does not already require a large amount of work. You don't want to spend all of your time & money on repairing the car. For example, find a modern vehicle that has been well looked after. Or if you want an Older car, see if you can find one off an elderly person as these cars are very likely to be well maintained and garaged so will not be rusty and smooth engines. Always get a mechanic to give the car a thorough check to highlight any problems that the vehicle have - and costs to repair (if you remove that part to do a mod, then don't worry about it). Its also a good idea to decide which MAKE & MODEL you want, before you go shopping (if you don't care about Makes/Models then just go hunting for the best).;
, This is a good way to see what cars you prefer (2Dr, 4Dr, Coupe, Sedan, Hatch, Wagon, SUVs, Utes, Trucks, Vans, etc) and what mod's work best with which vehicles. Once you have done some research - think what you want to do and try make it different - make your own ideas - try not too copy. Some of these following modifications, can make your car a show car. These can be expensive but it depends on how extreme you go. Keep it simple and you can easily DO IT YOURSELF and do it for a small cost. But some work may need to be done by a Professional if you are know too knowledgeable in these fields.


BODYKITS.






You can buy these pre-made or have one custom made. They can be made in Fibreglass or Plastic. Shop around Online, look thru Magazine adverts and visit some local businesses.


PAINT.






Although airbrushing & graphics can be cool, it can be over done - which is the case now-a-days, too many people go overboard and it can ruin a nice car. Try avoid going over the top, a nice two-tone paint or a nice glossy one-colour can score big points. Also adding a ""ghost flame"" or such into the paint is good also. Or a glitter or pearl in the clearcoat mix looks mint too. Have a look around, see what you prefer.


BODY MODS.






Mods such as:- rolling the guards, a/m front fenders, adding wings/spoilers (to front or back), a/m side mirrors, a/m head lights & tail lights, a/m bonnet (carbon fibre/fibreglass/vents). Just look for nice things that you can add to the body of the car. If you have a common make, there will be a lot out there. But some parts can be Universal Fit (eg can fit any vehicle) and need None or Minor mods to fit (check with the seller). You could also (preferred BEFORE you paint the car) is remove all the car badges, door handles, trimmings and door locks (this is called ""shaving"") - but best done professionally. You could also do- Flip Flop boot lid and/or Custom Bonnet Hinges (search the net for these if your unsure what these are).


INTERIOR.






 Re trimming seats/dash/pillars/floors/roof etc can score big points. Adding some colour like painting small plastic bits to suit the exterior colour can be good sometimes - or leave them unpainted or get them Chrome covered (some cars look even hotter like that). Look for other aftermarket parts like: pedals, shift knob, steering wheel, boot covers (gearshift and handbrake) and just anything else that is not factory. These items are usually very simple to install yourself - so go ahead but take your time. Adding lighting can be good, but try make it hidden so people only see the Glow, there is nothing worse than having a bright light in your face. Gauges are only cool, if they have a purpose eg Boost gauges for TURBO cars only. Make sure any gauges you fit, are actually working and custom gauge pods (holders) can look very staunch.


I.C.E.






(In Car Entertainment)- TV Screens, Speakers, CD Player, DVD Player, PS3, Xbox, Custom Installs, Subs, Amps, Capacitors, Lights, etc etc. All of these items installed properly and customized, can get big points! Try keep it all one brand if possible and try not to get to mixed up. These items are best left for the Pros to install for you so you get the BEST sound quality and can enter 'dB Drags' and battle for loudest ICE!


ENGINE.






The mods you can do will depend on what kind of car you have, and how fast you want it to go. Best to do some major research. See what can be done to your cars engine. Maybe go to some performance car workshops & see what they suggest. The main things that are done to show cars are: Major Turbo Setups / Superchargers, Custom Air Intake, Custom Exhaust System (and Extractors), and normal small items that help enhance power. But with power comes damage so make sure the cars engine can handle all the extreme mods - you may require:- rebuilt engine, forged pistons, larger fuel rail/injectors/pump etc the list goes on. PLEASE RESEARCH AND ASK PEOPLE. This can be tricky. But you don't have to be Turbo or Supercharged - a lot of Non-Turbo cars can have big power (N/A cars) simply by adding heaps of add-ons and doing big engine work. Adding some colour & polishing metal parts can also score big on engines & engine bays. Try make it look ""bling"" and people will love it. Even de looming (getting rid of wires) and shaving holes in the bay can be big points. Be sure you do it properly or get a Pro to do it - these jobs can be tricky.


WHEELS & SUSPENSION & BRAKES.






Massive wheels on a small car and vice versa can look ridiculous. Try the wheels on before buying, try a few sets and pick your favorite. Suspension & Brakes should be based on what engine mods you have done. You want to go fast, then you have to be able to stop & you want the car to handle good. Low does look good, but going too low can make your car illegal or impractical - check what's out there & see what he Pros say to do. Even airbag suspension or adjustable suspension can be done so look into that if you have the money. These can score big points and you can change the height of your car anytime.



, Before under going any Mods - check with your local Police Station or Vehicle Inspection agent. You don't want to spend BIG money on your car just so the Police can confiscate it and at worst, crush it! Also, please don't speed or race on Public roads! Take your pride n joy to the track!

, You may not win any, it depends on how extreme you go but at least you've got a PHAT RIDE! If you do not want to go to shows, at least you can show it off while cruising & picking up chicks!

Look for the best deal.After receiving all the bids from the dealerships you contacted, respond to all the dealerships except the one that offered you the lowest price and ask them if they can beat the lowest bid.,
Don’t settle for anything less than what you want.,
Close the deal.,
Apply for a fleet number.If you’re buying a number of cars through fleet sales for your business and plan on doing so again in the future, you should get a fleet number.",How to Buy a New Car Through Fleet Sales," Consider the color, manufacturer, and options of your car. Some of these might be irrelevant to you, but some might be important. Think about what matters to you in a car and what you’ll be doing with your car before deciding which to buy.


Certain features might depend on your intentions for the car. If you intend to haul lumber in your new vehicle, for instance, you should choose a sturdy pickup truck, not a small compact car.
If you have several kids you plan on shipping to soccer practice, school, and extracurricular activities, you might want a minivan.
Decide what parts of your specification are optional or negotiable. If you would prefer slate blue but will consider cobalt or want but don't require a sunroof, write that down, but don't disclose it right away. You can negotiate on these optional points later, if it makes sense to do so.;
, If you plan on selling your current car, you should include that money in the calculations when setting your budget. Be realistic when setting your budget. Don’t buy a car that is not affordable for you.


You could also think about getting financing for your car. Investigate what kinds of loans you qualify for with your bank or credit union.
Don’t forget to calculate the costs associated with taxes, licensing, and (potentially) interest.

, Consider cars that have high standards in safety and overall quality in addition to cars that meet the list of specifications you previously drafted. Check both user reviews and professional reviews written by automobile experts.


Consumer Reports, Kelly Blue Book, and Auto Trader are useful sources for researching and comparing cars.

, Typically, the final price of a fleet sales car is between $250 and $1,000 above the invoice price (what the dealership paid for the car).The fleet sales manager may talk about the price of the car you’re interested with from this reference point. For instance, if the fleet sales manager tells you a car is “$400 over,” that means it is $400 over the invoice price. A car that was invoiced for $20,000, then, would cost $2,400.


Each year, most dealerships get anywhere between $200,000 and several million dollars in volume bonuses (rebates given to dealerships when they move a certain number of vehicles). Therefore, their invoice price is not usually a true representation of the cost of the vehicle to the dealership.

, Knowing the dealer's invoice price and MSRP are the most important things when buying through fleet sales. Most dealerships will not hesitate to give you this information, if you ask. If the price is within your range, proceed with the purchase process. If it is not, find a car that better meets your financial specifications.


Many online tools will also help you figure out what a reasonable price for a given car is. For instance, the database at http://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html offers both MSRP and actual prices paid on a variety of vehicles.

, It can be a little tricky, however, because retail salesman may attempt to divert your shopping to their own department and might even pretend to be fleet salesmen. For this reason, it’s best to identify who the fleet manager of the dealership is before calling the dealership.Ask the operator or receptionist for the name of the fleet manager. If you are asked why you wish to know the fleet manager's name, say that you're doing research for your company's upcoming car purchase.
Be as insistent as you need to be. Once you get the name, ask to speak to the manager and tell him/her that you are interested in buying a car soon. Give a specific time frame (for instance, three days) to show that you're serious.
Call during regular weekday business hours. Fleet managers and salesmen deal with businesses, which usually operate on that schedule.If the manager asks which business you're affiliated with, give the name of the company you work for.Don't lie, however, and say the car is for business use when it's not. Fleet managers are often allowed to sell to private buyers, and if you handle the process professionally, the manager should have no problem doing business with you.

, Again, be sure it gets to the fleet department by using specific names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of fleet department managers or salespeople.


Note on the request for bids that you would like their best price and that you are asking other dealers. This should help shorten the process.
If you are willing to wait for the car you want to be ordered or transferred from another dealer, state as much on your specification sheet.

, After the various fleet managers get back to you with a bid, make an appointment to meet the ones who have what you’re looking for. If all you get is an invitation to come to the dealership without any kind of bid attached, ignore it; they probably don't have what you want and are hoping to convince you to get something else.


If you receive a bid that doesn't match exactly with your specifications, circle or underline any discrepancies so you can ask about them later.
If you're not seeing bids that you like, consider expanding your dealership radius, or shopping for a different car.

, Ask to see the car you're considering.Inspect it carefully. Look for dings in the windows, scratches on the surface, flat or low tires, and other imperfections. Pop the trunk and hood and look for anything that could be out of place. Read the window sticker to ensure the model has all the qualities you’re looking for. Finally, test drive the car.


Even if you've test driven that exact model already, sometimes individual cars have manufacturing variations, and it's worth taking a quick spin to make sure everything's in good shape.
During the test drive, listen for odd sounds coming from the engine, inoperable features like power windows, and other problems.
Remember, you are about to spend a lot of money and a lot of time in this car, so you should be sure that the car has everything you’re looking for.

, Many fleet departments waive these fees without you asking them to do so, but look over the final sale contract to ensure that they do. Ask that manufacturer rebates be factored into the final sales price as well.


If the fleet sales discounts are incompatible with regular retail sales discounts, ask that the more favorable set of sales discounts be applied to your purchase. For instance, if fleet sales offer cars at the invoice price plus $500, but the dealership is running a sale on that particular car that is lower than the fleet sales price, ask the dealership to sell you the car at the lower retail price.

,


Next, take your two lowest offers and call the dealership with the higher of the two. Make a firm offer to buy the car at a price that's slightly lower (maybe $200) than the lowest bid; if they say yes, ask them to fax you that bid immediately and make an appointment to fill out the paperwork and buy the car. If they say no, call the dealer with the lowest bid and make an appointment to fill out the paperwork and buy the car.
Starting this process a week before the end of the month will get you better bids because that's when most dealerships are eager to move inventory.
Buy under favorable conditions. For instance, you could choose to buy a summer car (a convertible, for instance) during winter. Sometimes a dealership will drop their selling price a few hundred dollars to move a stale car off their lot.

, Find a dealership that offers exactly what you're looking for.Your area, as far as car dealerships are concerned, should be pretty big. If you can save $500 or $1000 or more by going to another dealership, or get something much closer to what you want, it can be well worth a one-time drive to a dealer a few towns away.


Wait for the various dealerships to respond with a quotation and compare the offers. Read each offer carefully.

, Another unique thing about dealing with fleet sales is that a fleet manager or salesperson can do everything -- sell the car and arrange financing -- without the cryptic consultations between the retail and financing departments that you'd experience otherwise.If you haven't arranged your own financing, the fleet sales department can help you. However, be prepared to make a cash purchase, since many fleet sales departments expect you will.

, The fleet number will enable you to qualify for deeper discounts than you would as a private purchaser. When you get a fleet number from the automaker, you can use it in future purchases to smooth the transaction.


Contact the auto manufacturer you’re interested in purchasing from in order to apply for a fleet number.
If you’re just buying a private car for yourself through fleet sales, you don’t need (and cannot obtain) a fleet number.

You will need to know the vehicle's make, model, and vehicle identification number (VIN), which can all be found on the vehicle's registration paperwork.Though the process may vary somewhat by state, in general an inquiry will follow the same procedure. The DMV will be able to tell you the last date that a title was processed in that state, how many liens (if any) exist on the vehicle, and the name and address of each lien holder.Provide your contact information in the online form through the DMV's website. Fill in all the necessary information for the DMV to identify the vehicle. This will typically include the make, model and year of the vehicle, as well as the VIN.Save the form as a PDF or image file.Attach the form in an email and send it to the email address listed on the DMV website.;
, Many websites, including VehicleIdentificationNumber.comand Carfax, allow you to search for lien information, using the VIN and the vehicle's make and model. Some of these websites are free, while others charge a fee.

, Some countries have a government-run Personal Property Securities Register, or a similar registry in place, in which security interests held in personal property (in this case, automobiles) are cataloged online and can be searched for by interested parties. If you live in a place that has such a registry, you can search online to find out whether or not the car you're buying has money owed on it.Buyers in Australia and New Zealand can go to http://www.ppsr.govt.nz/cms and click ""search."" Buyers can also have search results texted to a mobile phone for a $3 service fee., HPI is a company that checks vehicle registrations to verify the histories of used cars.HPI Checks can tell potential buyers if a car has outstanding finance owed on it, as well as whether the vehicle is stolen or has altered mileage. HPI Checks are not free, but can provide peace of mind when it comes to buying a used vehicle., In some countries, a car owner must show potential buyers a copy of an official certificate of registration, which can only be had if there are no debts owed on the car. In other countries, the automobile's title will reflect that the bank has liens on the vehicle, indicating that the seller has outstanding loans with a financial institution., If you're interested in buying a used car with finances owed, you may want to first insist that the seller pays off his debt before you give him any money. You may want to suggest that the seller take out a personal loan to cover the costs, in order to secure the title before you buy it from him.If you insist that the seller pays off his loans before you buy the vehicle, make sure you get a signed, written proof of payment from the seller's bank or financing company. If you can, accompany the seller to the bank or financial institution so that you can oversee the process and know for certain that the vehicle's loans have been paid in full.If you cannot get something in writing from the bank verifying that the loans were paid in full, you may want to run another search through PPSR or HPI, if those options are available where you will be purchasing the vehicle. This will allow you to verify that the loans have been settled., If you're still interested in purchasing the vehicle, try to renegotiate the price you would pay to the seller, after factoring in how much he still owes on the vehicle's loans.Subtract the amount that the seller owes to the bank from the price you initially thought was a reasonable sales price for the vehicle. Offer to pay the seller that amount, after you've paid off the remainder of the seller's loan to the bank or financial institution who has a lien on the vehicle.Have the seller send a dated payout quote directly to you. Once you've paid off the loan, and given any remaining money to the seller after agreeing on a price, you can have the title transferred to your name., If you worry about the seller not holding his end of the agreement to pay off his car loans, you can always set up an escrow account. This would hold your money for a stipulated period of time, during which the seller must pay off his loans and transfer the title to you in order to receive your money.In the United States, the Department of Motor Vehicles recommends using PaySAFE Escrow.Set up an account at https://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow.
Create a transaction, and have the seller agree to the terms and conditions.Deposit your money. PaySAFE will not release the money to the seller until the loans have been settled and the title is ready to change hands., By getting a dealership involved, you ensure that there will be a paper trail that proves all payments were made and that ownership is legal. You may have to pay more, as the dealer will want to make a profit by buying the car from the seller and in turn selling it to you, but you will have peace of mind with your purchase.Expect this to be a costlier option, as the dealer will want to make some money from the sale. You could ask the seller to pay the dealer out of his or her profits, so that you do not end up having to pay more for the car."

Identify a location on the car for the decal.,
Place the decal on the vehicle to measure.,
Use a tape measure to help center the decal.,
Use pieces of masking tape to mark the location.,
Clean the area.,
Do not use any cleaner that leaves a film or oil on the car.,
Allow the cleaned area to dry completely.,
Peel off the beginning of the backing.,
Apply the corner of the exposed decal to the car.,
Unpeel the backing as you go.,
Leave the transfer tape on the decal while it dries in place.,
Peel the transfer tape off.,
Use a credit card to press out any bubbles.",How to Add Custom Decals to a Car," Before applying a decal, you must determine the location on the car you want to place it. This is particularly important for large decals that may extend onto multiple body components, as you will need to plan for applications that extend over gaps.Assess the area you want the decal to be placed and determine if it will fit there.;
, Hold the decal up against the vehicle to get a sense of how it will look and if it will fit in the area you’ve chosen. This will give you a sense of how the decal will look and the best placement for it.Leave the protective backing on the decal so it doesn’t stick as you hold it against the vehicle.
Ensure the vehicle is dry before pressing the decal and backing into it.

, While you can get a solid sense of where you’d like the decal by holding it up against the vehicle, using a tape measure can help to ensure you have it placed properly.If you are placing identical decals on either side, ensure they are an equal distance from at least three points on the body of the car to make the placement match on either side.
Measure the distance from things like the trunk lid, door or window.

, Once you’ve measured out exactly where you want the decal to sit, tear off small pieces of masking tape and place them at each corner of where the decal will be applied.The masking tape will serve as a guide when you begin applying the decal.
Masking tape will not damage the paint on the vehicle.

, Once you have the area the decal will be applied determined, use a soft cloth and a mild cleaner on the surface of the car. Rubbing alcohol will clean the area well and evaporate quickly, making it a common choice.Do not simply spray the cleaner onto the car or it may soak the masking tape you’ve used as a guide.
Apply cleaner to a rag and wipe where the decal will stick to the car.

, Some cleaners like Windex or spray on cleaner-waxes leave a residue intended to help maintain shine. This residue will prevent the decal from sticking properly to the vehicle.Rubbing alcohol or basic car wash soap both will clean the area sufficiently.
Be sure to rinse the area thoroughly if you use car wash soap.

, Decals won’t stick as well to a wet surface, so either dry the area you cleaned with a towel or allow it to air dry completely before moving on. If you opt to use a towel, use a chamois cloth to avoid damaging the paint.Wait for the surface to be completely dry before applying the decal.

, Depending on the size of the decal, you may choose to remove the entire backing or just a portion of it at a time. If the decal is larger than your forearm, you may want to peel off the backing in thirds to make application more manageable.Decals that are only a few inches long can have the backing completely removed.
Only peel off a bit of the backing at a time for larger decals such as ones that will stretch the length of the vehicle.

, Use the tape on the car as a guide as you begin by applying the corner of the decal to the vehicle. Press the corner into the vehicle firmly, then use a straight edged tool such as a credit card to press more of the decal down in a controlled manner.Keep the decal pulled taught as you press it into the vehicle to prevent bubbling from occurring.
Using a straight edged tool helps ensure you apply pressure over the entire decal, which will force out small bubbles.

, As you apply more of the decal to the vehicle, peel more of the backing off to reveal more of the decal. Peel the backing off a few inches at a time to ensure you can keep the decal straight as you apply it without worrying about other parts sticking.Continue to apply the decal to the car while peeling back more of the backing as you progress.

, While you may be able to remove the transfer tape immediately upon pressing the decal into the car, it’s best that you leave it to dry for a bit of time. Waiting 30 minutes can make removing the transfer tape much easier and reduce the chances that you’ll pull any of the decal off with it.Allowing the decal to sit in direct sunlight will make the transfer tape easier to remove.
Do not attempt to speed up the process by using a heat source such a hair dryer, as it may melt the decal.

, After thirty minutes or so, peel the transfer tape off starting at one corner. Peel the tape back slowly while watching for any areas the decal may peel back with the transfer tape. If the decal begins to peel off with the tape, press the tape and decal back into place firmly, and begin peeling the tape away again from another angle.Be careful not to tear the decal while removing the transfer tape.
Slow, steady movements are the best way to prevent damage to the decal.

, With the transfer tape removed, you will be able to see the decal on the vehicle. It is normal for there to be some bubbling in the decal. Some of those bubbles are easy to remove by pressing a credit card or other flat tool onto the decal and pushing the bubble toward the edge.Be careful not to press a sharp edge into the decal or it may tear it.
Small bubbles will disappear on their own over the first few days.

If for some reason you do not have the original Certificate of Title, you must get a duplicate from the Department of Motor Vehicles.


If the car was previously titled in Nevada, you must apply to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles for a duplicate. The application form is available at http://dmvnv.com/pdfforms/vp012.pdf.
If the car was previously titled in another state, you must apply to that state to get a duplicate title.;
, In Nevada, you may not sell a car that has outstanding liens on it. The new owner is not allowed to agree to take over your payments. You must first satisfy those liens and have the lien holder sign off that the loans are paid, and then you can proceed with your sale., It is important that you accurately complete all the seller’s information as it is typed on the Certificate of Title. If you do not complete the transfer information accurately, then the sale may not be valid.


If the original title listed more than one name as owner, you need to pay close attention to the way they are listed. If the original owners were listed as A “and” B, then both people must sign the transfer. If the original owners were listed as A “or” B, then either one may sign the transfer for it to be valid., Federal and state laws require that the seller must disclose the accurate odometer reading whenever a vehicle is sold or transferred by gift, inheritance, etc., Both the seller (one or more, as required) and the buyer must sign the transfer portion of the Certificate of Title to complete the sale. The title is then given to the buyer, who then becomes responsible for his own insurance and registration with the state.One exception is that if the buyer is getting a loan to buy the vehicle, and if that lender is keeping a lien on the vehicle, then the title will go to the lender. The lender will keep the title until the loan is repaid in full. The buyer is still responsible for insurance and registration for the vehicle in order to be able to drive it.

, The Bill of Sale provides proof of sale for your car. It will also protect you from being responsible for the car if it is abandoned by the person you sold it to.You can get a copy of the Official Nevada Bill of Sale form in three different ways:


Download the DMV Bill of Sale form. You can find the official Nevada DMV Bill of Sale form at http://dmvnv.com/pdfforms/vp104.pdf. Print a copy of that form and complete it as part of your sale of the vehicle.
Visit a Nevada DMV office in your area to pick up a copy.
Call the DMV's Vehicle Title department 775-684-4810 to request that a Bill of Sale form be mailed to you.

, All spaces on the form must be filled in completely and accurately. Any mistakes on the form - even if there is evidence of erasing a mistake - will require you to start over or get additional documentation.The Bill of Sale requires:


Identification and address of the buyer(s)
Identification and address of the seller(s)
Sale price
Vehicle Identification Number for the car
Signatures of buyer(s) and seller(s).

, The seller will keep the Bill of Sale as a record of the transaction. A copy should be made for the buyer. It will be needed for the buyer to register the vehicle., This process will cancel the registration that you had on the vehicle and will release you from any financial or legal obligations and responsibilities that could arise after the sale. You may also be entitled to a registration fee credit.Use the online portal. To provide notice of the transfer online (and save a trip to the DMV in person), you can visit the DMV website at https://dmvapp.nv.gov/DMV/Application/DMVPortal/Pages/Default.aspx. You will be asked to create an account, and then you can follow the links to notify the state of the transfer of the vehicle.
Visit a DMV office. Call ahead to find out if you can make an appointment to save time waiting in line. You can find the list of DMV offices at http://dmvnv.com/locat.htm#Full.

, When you sell a car in Nevada, you may not leave the plates on the car for the new buyer. You must remove them and either transfer them to another car that you own or return them to the DMV. Your surrender options include returning your plates to a DMV office, mailing your plates to the DMV, or keeping your plates as a souvenir.Surrender the plates in person. Take your license plates to a full service DMV office location and turn them in to a DMV representative. Call ahead to find out if you can make an appointment to save time waiting in line. You can find the list of DMV offices at http://dmvnv.com/locat.htm#Full.
Surrender the plates by mail. Mail your license plates, decals, and a signed letter that contains your contact information and requests license plate cancellation to the DMV. Send your plates to: Department of Motor Vehicles, Central Services Division, 555 Wright Way, Carson City, Nevada 89711-0700., If you would like to use the license plates on another car that you own, you can complete this transfer and register the plates to the new car online. You will use the MyDMV portal at https://dmvapp.nv.gov/DMV/Application/DMVPortal/Pages/Default.aspx., This procedure will require you to take the plates to a DMV office and scrape the decal from your rear license plate in person in front of a DMV representative. You will then be allowed to keep the plates as a souvenir or for possible use again in the future.

Reduce the weight of the car.,
Upgrade to a free-flowing exhaust system.,
Use test piping.,
Upgrade to a free-flow aftermarket air filter.,
Research turbocharge and supercharge options.",How to Boost Your Car's Horsepower1," One of the easiest things that you can do right now to increase the horsepower is to make your vehicle as light as possible, which allows your vehicle accelerate better. Remove unnecessary clutter from your car, and strip it down as much as possible for optimum performance.;
, Upgrading to a high-performance exhaust system can increase your horsepower by a measure of five to 10 on some natural aspiration vehicles, while vehicles with an additional supercharger can pick up much more.


It's a common misconception that oversized piping negatively affects back pressure, resulting in a loss of low-end torque and power. In truth, most engines prefer the most free-flowing system, in terms of intake, header and exhaust.

, Research ""cat-back"" systems for purchase, also sometimes called ""test piping."" These systems run from your catalytic converter to the end of the exhaust piping, increasing horsepower. The installation kit is generally several hundred dollars, but you could save on the price by shopping around and doing it yourself.


Measure the diameter of the pipe that comes out of your catalytic converter, and replace with larger exhaust piping. You can pay to have this installed at the shop, or you can do it yourself by cutting the old exhaust piping and leaving a few inches to weld onto. If you do, position the new system in place and weld or clamp it to the spot you just cut. Reinstall the hangers that you removed.

, It's also a good idea to buy a free-flow air filter that fits your car and install it to slightly increase your HP. It's not a big change, but it's a good way to ensure that your vehicle is performing at the highest-possible level.


Open the hood, locate the air filter housing, and remove it. Unscrew clamps or screws, taking care to avoid getting any contaminants into the filter housing. Remove and discard the old air filter. Clean the inside of the box with a damp cloth and insert your new, free-flow filter.
Be aware the many aftermarket air filters will actually allow greater particulate matter to pass into the engine and oil filters, especially if improperly maintained, and will also spray oil into the intake. The oil from the filter can damage or destroy the mass air flow (MAF) sensor on vehicles so equipped. In forced-induction engines the marginal benefit of increased air flow with an aftermarket filter is generally outweighed by the fact that the turbo will supply the requested air regardless of the filter used, and greatly increased reliability from not having oil and sand in the intake and on the MAF.

, Installing a supercharger in a large-block engine, or a turbocharger in a smaller-block, will basically involve completely rebuilding your engine and upgrading the stress-bearing components of the engine, which will cost several thousands of dollars. It's a huge project, but is the most effective way to increase the horsepower of your vehicle.If you're committed to installing a supercharger in your car, you might consider the following varieties:



Root superchargers are the oldest type of supercharger system, usually among the cheapest, are and quite popular among racing vehicles. They work by funneling extremely large quantities of air through the intake manifold, providing quick bursts of energy.

Twin screw superchargers pull air through lobes, which becomes trapped in the rotor housing and becomes compressed in a cone-shaped tapering device. Not legal in all states, these superchargers tend to be extremely loud.

Centrifugal superchargers make use of a powered impeller to pull high-pressure air into a compressor, reaching upward of 60,000 RPM easily, making them the most efficient supercharger for your vehicle.

Resist the urge to customize.",How to Increase Your Car's Resale Value," As you probably know, mileage is really the first thing a car's value depends on. Your car might look astonishingly new, but the price will mostly be determined by how many miles it has traveled. If you're planning on selling the car after a few years, you shouldn't bring it with you on your road trip around the globe.


Math is not always that objective. There are some psychological barriers: the gap between 98,000 and 100,000 is wider than it looks. If you're approaching one of such round figures, it's better to keep your mileage below the limit.;
, You can find the schedule in the back of the owner's manual. Your prospective buyers wants to know that the car was properly looked after by its previous owner: make sure the car is always in good mechanical conditions.


Whenever there's a problem or a cosmetic issue, don't put it off: make repairs straight away.
If the repair involves a minor issue, consult your mechanic to check whether its costs are worth the trade-in value.

, Save all receipts for maintenance and repair work, no matter how minor. A documented service history underscores the fact that your car has been well taken care of. Savvy used-car buyers will be willing to pay extra for that reassurance.


There are websites that keep your car's history on file, like Carfax or Experian.

, Physical protection is extremely important in maintaining your car properly. Sunlight and weather can damage your vehicle or make it age more quickly. Storing the car in a garage is by far the best option.


Parking your car under a tree is risky for several reasons: birds' droppings, sap and falling branches can damage the exterior.

, The better your car appears to be kept up, the more it will be worth: most people associate cleanliness with care. The best bet is to apply a paint and fabric protection pack , which makes washing and waxing much easier. pack.


Put the same care in keeping the interior clean as you would for the exterior: floor mats can prevent stains and are easily washable or removable.Empty side and glove compartments from cups and other trash on a regular basis.
If you have a dog, it's not the best idea to take it around in your car. The smell and hair can be hard to remove if you want to resell it.
Smoking is also a no-no if you want to resell your car: it'll be very hard to get rid of the smell, no matter how much you wash it.

, Any history of collision damage can ding your car's resale value: a trained used-car appraiser can spot body work from a mile away. Although it's hard for any car to avoid an occasional dent or scratch in its lifetime, try to keep these down to a minimum.


If your car is in a collision, use an experienced repair shop with a good reputation and insist on using factory (also known as OEM, for Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts. Save all receipts and be upfront about any collision repair work when it comes time to sell or trade. Being evasive may lead the buyer to believe that the damage was more extensive than you are letting on.

, If there isn't a huge demand for used cars or fuel prices go up, you might want to wait a little longer before putting your car on the market.


Your timing in choosing when to visit the used-car dealership is just as important. Avoid busy days: dealers will listen to you more carefully and probably offer you a better price., Talk to your mechanic to see which repair costs outweigh the trade-in price. Some fixes won't be worth bothering, while some others can increase your car's value with little money. For example:


replacing lights is usually cheap, but they'll make a huge difference for your prospective buyer;
Repairing a cracked windshield is less expensive than what a second-hand buyer would deduct when seeing the damage, so it's well worth the price;
worn-out tires can also be replaced at a cost that is worth the car's selling value;
visible dents and scratches should be fixed before reselling. This might get pricey, but the car's exterior look has a huge impact on its value., Needless to say, the car should look at its best both inside and outside when you trade it in. Replacing floor mats is a good idea, if they don't look like new.


Don't use household cleaners in your car, except the glass cleaner on windows: buy specific products.
Clean headlight covers with the right cleaning product: this is just a cosmetic fix, but it will make your lights look brand new even if you haven't replace them.If your car is worth a fair amount of money, it might be good for you to invest some in a professional detailing service ('detailing' means 'cleaning every corner to the smallest detail'). You might do your best with your sponge and vacuum, but a professionally cleaned car will always look better.

, Polishing your car with wax will bring its color back to its glorious days. If you barely remember what it looked like, check the interior of your door frame and you'll get a sense of what the exterior should look like., Talk to as many as you can and pick the one that gives you the best figure. As a matter of fact, buying your car was an investment and you don't want to throw it away at the first occasion.


Be prepared to make a convincing case when trading in the car. You should do some homework online before to check how much your car is worth, and then argue for a higher price based on evidence. State the pros and cons of your vehicle and cite sources with current estimates of your car's value.

, A car's brand plays a major role in it based on many factors, including desirability and reliability. Consult a good used car pricing site to research the resale history of the models in which you are interested. If you do your research well, the car can retain up to 60 percent of its resale value after three years.


Some Japanese makes, such as Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Hyundai and Mazda always hold their value well. In the United States, imports generally hold their value better than American cars.
In the luxury market share, Lexus, Acura, Mercedes and Audi are the makes that usually have better trade-in value. Generally speaking, the value of luxury cars tends to decrease less with time., Selling a used car with a live warranty can greatly boost its value. A factory warranty is usually valued more highly than an extended one from your local dealer.


Although warranties once covered up to three years or 100,000 miles, it is now possible to purchase cars with factory warranties of up to seven years., Because of the decreased demand in manual transmission, a car with no stick is more likely to resell at a higher price. It might be worth spending more on this if you're planning to sell your car after a few years: you'll probably recoup the cost., Except for sports cars, where a rear-wheel-drive is generally preferred, four-wheel drives are worth much more at resale time.


Climate is also a factor in this. If you're reselling the car in regions with harsh weather conditions and snow, a four-wheel drive is a must-have feature.

, Let's face it: bright paints, also known as 'hero colors', are not as popular as black, white, grey and metallic finishes. They also age much faster.


For some sport cars and specific makes, like Falcons and Commodores, brash colors are part of the car's unique selling points. In this case, it's unlikely that the resale value will be affected., Although you can get an inexpensive phone app to direct you to your final destination, navigators are always appreciated as an in-car technology, and they're now considerably cheaper than they used to be.


There's no point in wasting money on technologies worth a fortune. Buyers of used cars are not usually on the lookout for the latest gizmo. An inexpensive navigation system is enough to recoup the costs.

, Spending unnecessary money on add-ons can actually backfire. The point of aftermarket options is to personalize the car to your taste, not everyone else's. Your prospective second-hand buyer might have very different ideas on what a car should or shouldn't have.For example, expensive stereos are among the most expensive aftermarket options which aren't worth their price. If you like a top-quality listening experience, go ahead and spend your money, but don't expect it to pay off once you resell!
Performance modifications are also looked down on at trade-in time: second-hand buyers are looking for a safe and well-maintained car, not a fast-and-furious showpiece.
There are exceptions to this rule. Some add-ons that enhance a car's resale value are alloy wheels, sunroofs and intelligent keys (with which you can start a car without physically turning a switch, or automatically configure seats' and mirrors' position based on your preference)."
"
Enhance a turbocharged engine with a programmer.,
Enhance supercharged engine's computer with a power module.,
Weigh the pros and cons.",How to Boost Your Car's Horsepower2," These devices modify the programming on your vehicle's computer, called ""reflashing,"" to allow for more horsepower, torque, and sometimes better fuel economy. On a naturally-aspirated engine, the horsepower increase will be quite minor, but with a supercharger you can see huge gains in HP.


Some auto shops will advertise flashing options, saving you lots of money in the process. In practical terms, it's not something people often do themselves, so you might talk with a mechanic you trust about it if you're interested., Aftermarket power modules can be used in a similar way, sometimes offering up to 30 extra HP with proper installation.


To install, look in the driver's manual, a Chilton or a Haynes guide to see how to access the car's computer, then disconnect negative battery cable and unplug the wiring harness from the computer.
Plug in an aftermarket power module. Insert it between the wiring harness and the computer. Reconnect negative battery cable.

, On the upside, re-flashing the computer in your car can be a great and efficient way of upping the horsepower, giving you a powerful ride. On the downside, it's an expensive process that requires you already have a supercharged engine — another expensive process. Many performance modifications to an engine can also decrease its fuel economy, and reflashing also generally voids any warranty on a vehicle you've purchased. Know that if you choose to complete the process, it's on you.

You can download and print this form online here.Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form REG 262. This form isn't available online because it is printed on special security paper. To get it, you need to call the DMV at 1-800-777-0133 and request to have a copy mailed to you.;
, Selling many cars requires up-to-date certification from a STAR smog test station. You can search for STAR stations near you here.Smog certifications are valid for 90 days — you must complete the sale within this time or get re-tested. Note, however, that many cars do not need smog certification when sold. Cars that do not need to be tested include:""Hybrid"" cars
Cars that run on diesel
Cars that run on electricity
Cars that run on natural gas
Cars less than four years old
Cars made before 1975

, The vast majority of consumer guides recommend buyers to have the car they plan to purchase inspected by a licensed technician before exchanging any money for it.It is typically the buyer's responsibility to pay for the inspection or perform it personally. However, it's still your car at this point, so you may need to work out an arrangement to accommodate the buyer's request.Consider getting a mobile inspection service to inspect the car on your property if you don't want to go to the trouble of taking it to a mechanic.


Be sure to keep all documentation from the inspection — especially if the mechanic finds an issue that may be cause for concern.

, Depending on the specifics of your situation, the fees you and the buyer may need to pay can vary. The fees you owe are determined when the transfer application is submitted to the DMV. These may include, but are not limited to:Transfer fee ($15 plus tax). This is paid by the buyer.Use tax (depends on the county and city) This is paid by the buyer.Duplicate title fee

, For most car sales, the forms above will be sufficient. However, some situation call for extra documentation. See below:If you are selling a commercial vehicle, you may need Declaration of Gross Vehicle Weight/Combined Gross Vehicle Weight Form Form REG 4008 (available here.If you are selling to a family member, you need Statement of Facts Form REG 256 (available here).
If your car is under a lien, you will need the lienholder's release notarized. Note also that there are sections on the transfer forms above for the lienholder to sign.
If your name is misspelled or printed in error on your car title, you will need Statement of Error or Erasure REG 101 (available here).If your car is missing a license plate, registration stickers, or other important documentation, you will need Application for Replacement Plates, Stickers, Documents Form REG 156 (available here)., Download and print the forms in the section above that you need. Call the DMV to request Form REG 262, making sure to allow enough time for it to arrive in the mail.


If your car is under a lien, this is a good time to get the lienholder's release (as well as his or her signature on the transfer forms).

, This is your chance to clarify any misunderstandings and work out any differences of opinion. The most important thing to review and agree on is the price of the sale (documented on REG 227), but it's a good idea to go over all of the documents together to ensure total agreement.


In addition to completing the forms together, you will also need to sign your car's title to confirm that you release ownership of it.

, Because the number of miles a car has traveled can affect its monetary value, this information is critical. Be sure to record the odometer reading on REG 262 and the title and make sure the buyer sees and understands the reading. Falsifying this information, failing to disclose it, or tampering with the odometer is a crime. However, you don't need to do this if thevehicle is 10 years old or more., When you and your buyer have reviewed all of the paperwork, give it to an associate at the DMV. Your transfer request will be registered and logged in the official records.

, As the seller, you have five days to report the transfer. Luckily, you can do this online here, or at the DMV when you submit your paperwork.You will need the car's license plate number, the last five digits of the VIN, and the new owner's name and address.


The buyer must also report the transfer of the car. However, s/he has 10 days.

Start working on the main chassis. In this picture, the wooden stand is holding the forks in their desired position. Trying to figure out how to build the main connecting chassis. Don't use more 2"" round tube like the scooter frame. It's not strong enough.

, The photo shows the beginnings of the vehicle with a plank clamped to the frame for a seat, after three months of building. There's also a forward foot rest using conduit coming forward from the frame, hung with red straps, and a speedometer connected to the handlebars. This experience should prove the concept and provide a helpful inspiration to the next phase: building the body.

, In this photo, the white panels of the overhead door are done, but the windows must be sculpted once the position of the lower edges are decided upon.

When all are ready, the panel is removed, silicone caulk is applied, and the whole thing finally screwed down and excess caulk removed. Screw holes are also caulked. You can see that seating experiments were also going on: a rather minimalist plank and bungee cords used as a backrest. Not enough comfort!


In the lower picture, you see some bald guy bending the 1.5"" wide by eighth-inch thick flatbar, which will be the forward frame of the overhead door, using the forward arch as a form for the bending. A small piece of conduit is used to help the bending. Be sure to overbend the arch, so it is sprung in place when attached. Otherwise the sides will bow outward and let in weather. This picture, of course, was taken before the picture above.

, This will eventually disappear behind the black side panels with the moonbeam logo, which you see on the home page. I didn't want to mess with the widely-spaced steering head bearings., This photo is looking forward from the driver's seat. It's a good view of the back-to-back ""Heim"" fittings which go from the steering arm below the handlebars out in opposite directions to each wheel. You can also see some of the 2"" flatbar welded between the two forward frame members to be junctions of the plastic body panels. You can see the 4"" automotive headlights jammed into 4"" rubber pipe couplings as a nice simple way to mount headlight bulbs. You can see the steering post , wrapped in black tape to minimize glare, coming out of the front frame member to give the maximum legroom to the passenger."

Connect the manual or electronic latches.",How to Add a Sunroof to Your Car," There are a number of different options in aftermarket sunroofs. You will need to decide on a type of sunroof in order to establish the dimensions you want and the budget you have to work with. Pop up sunroofs are often the least expensive, while fully automatic sunroofs usually cost the most.Pop up sunroofs cannot slide open. Instead, the back of the sunroof pops up with a hinge on the front.
Some sunroofs can be slide backward by hand without having to purchase an expensive electronic sunroof.
Electronic sunroofs use motors to open and close and can be purchased to slide open, pop open, or both.;
, The size of the sunroof you can purchase depends on the amount of completely flat space on the roof of your vehicle. Measure from left to right until the roof begins to curve down towards the windows, then measure from front to back in the same manner.While it is possible to mount a sunroof that extends into the curved area of the roof, it would require custom bodywork to accomplish.
Write down the dimensions of the flat area of you roof to help you choose a sunroof kit that would fit.

, Armed with the maximum dimensions for a sunroof your vehicle could support, go online and find a sunroof kit that combines the type of sunroof you want with the size you need to fit on your vehicle. Choose a sunroof that is at least an inch smaller than the maximum dimensions to ensure you have no issues with fitment.You can find sunroof kits for most vehicle applications at www.Webasto.com, www.TGautomotive.com or www.summitracing.com
Look for a complete kit that includes weather proofing, template, and wiring if you purchase an electronic sunroof.

, Masking tape will protect the paint on your roof from being damaged as you position the sunroof template over it and begin the drilling and cutting process. The tape will keep the paint from cracking or tearing as you cut through it. This will prevent you from having to repaint the top of the vehicle upon the completion of the project.Painters tape will also work for this purpose.
Do not use duct tape or any other strong adhesive tape or it may leave a residue or damage the paint when removed.

, The sunroof kit will come with a rubber template you can use to determine where exactly you want to have the sunroof positioned once installed. Center it on the roof on top of the masking tape. Measure the distance from the front, back and each side to ensure it is perfectly centered.Use a tape measure to ensure the template is equal distance from each side of the car.
Depending on the size and style of your vehicle, you may want the sunroof closer to the front than the rear of the roof.

, With the rubber template in place, use a razor blade or exacto-knife to trace the template into the masking tape on your roof. Trace it slowly and carefully to ensure you create an exact outline of the template in the tape. You do not need to press the blade down hard enough to penetrate the paint through the tape.If you press through the tape into the roof, be very careful not to make any mistakes that will damage the paint that will remain after the sunroof install.
Tracing with a blade instead of a pen will create a groove that will make it easier to cut along the line.

, Use a 4 millimeter drill bit to drill four holes into the top of the roof. Make each hole about five inches from the corner of the sunroof outline along the traced line you already cut with the razor blade. Be careful not to get the drill caught in the cloth headliner inside the vehicle.Drill these holes very careful to ensure they are on the line and not to either side of it.
Remember that drilling holes through the roof is the point of no return. Once you drill the holes, the roof will leak unless you complete the installation of the sunroof.

, The sunroof kit will come with a supplied 4 millimeter probe to use to penetrate the cloth headliner beneath the roof. Press the probe down through the drilled holes and then through the headliner. These holes will serve as your guide when cutting the headliner in the next step.If your kit did not come with a supplied probe, use a sharp object to pierce the cloth of the headliner.
Be careful to pierce the headliner instead of tearing it.

, Use a sharp pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut the headliner inside the vehicle, using the four holes as a guide. Be careful not to tear the headliner while doing so. Once there is a hole in the headliner, remove any sound proofing or insulation between where it was and the metal of the roof.If you tear the headliner, it will have to be replaced.
You may need to use a razor blade to cut any sound proofing or insulation above the headliner as well.

, Using a larger drill bit than previously used, enlarge one of the four holes in the roof enough to fit a sheet metal nibbler tool in. You may also use a rat-tail file to enlarge the hole. Be careful to enlarge it without drilling or filing past the outside of the traced template for the sunroof, otherwise that portion will leak after the sunroof is installed.Use the nibbler tool to assess how large you will need to make the hole in order to fit it in.
Do not drill or file past the traced outline of the sunroof.

, Insert the sheet metal nibbler tool into the enlarged hole in the roof, then slowly and careful cut along the traced line in the roof. Keep the blades of the nibbler precisely in the groove you created with the razor blade, but it’s okay if you cut into the center portion of the outline.Cut very slowly to ensure you stay along the traced line. The lines must be straight in order for the sunroof to mount properly.
Take breaks if you need to in order to ensure you are able to continue to cut slowly and carefully.

, Once you have cut along the outline entirely, put on a pair of heavy duty gloves and remove the sheet metal that you cut out from the roof. Be very careful, as the metal may be quite sharp. Inspect the hole you cut and ensure you removed all of the metal inside the traced area.If there are any small portions of metal left inside the traced area, use the nibbler tool to trim them off now.
Be very careful when trimming the edges not to cut into the roof beyond the outline.

, With the cutting complete, you can now remove all of the masking tape you layered onto the roof of the car. Once done, inspect the hole you cut and use a metal file to file down any jagged edges sticking out as a result of the cutting. Be careful not to damage the remaining paint with the file.File the edges until the hole’s lines are all straight and free from burrs or jagged bits of metal sticking out.
Be careful not to damage the paint on the roof of the vehicle now that the masking tape is removed.

, The metal surrounding the hole you cut in the roof will be susceptible to rust without any form of protection. Purchase a small bottle of primer and apply it to any visible metal in and around the hole. Allow the primer to dry completely, then do the same with the clear coat.The primer and clear coat will not be visible once the sunroof is installed, but it will prevent rust from forming beneath it.
Check the label on the primer and clear coat to know how long to let each dry before moving on to the next step.

, Remove the weather sealing trim from the sunroof kit and put it on the sunroof frame if it does not come together. The weather seal will be adhesive, so peel the cover off of it then stick to around the perimeter of the bottom of the frame. Then place the frame into the newly cut hole in your roof, weather seal down.If the weather seal came attached to the frame, simple drop the frame into place.
Be careful not to move the frame around once in place or it may damage the paint on the roof.
Electronic sunroofs may contain the sunroof itself as a part of the outer frame.

, From inside the car, slide the inner frame into place with the outer frame. Use the supplied screws to secure the two together. Screwing the inner and outer frames together will secure the front hinges and the rear latch on non-electronic sunroofs. If your sunroof is electronic, you will need to run the wiring from the inner frame above the headliner and into the A-pillar to reach the fuse box near the driver’s side seat.If you need to run wires above the headliner, you will likely need to remove it completely. You will need to purchase and install a new headliner.
Once you’ve run the wiring down through the A-pillar of your car, wire it into the fuse box the same way you would wire in a car stereo.

, To make sure the headliner doesn’t hang loose around the new sunroof, you will need to glue it back into place. Apply the adhesive strips provided in the sunroof kit to the underside of the roof above the headliner, then press the headliner up into the strips. Be careful to press the headliner into the strips evenly to avoid creating wrinkles in the headliner.Be careful when applying the adhesive strips. They are not intended to be applied and removed again, so take your time.
Trying to pull the headliner from the strips once it is in place will likely tear the headliner.

, Once the headliner is glued down, ensure you cut off any remaining bits of cloth that hang out and then slide the finishing trim into place over it. This finishing trim is usually applied with adhesive, but may be held in place with screws instead depending on the kit you purchase.This finishing trim does not increase the seal, but rather just makes the edges of the sunroof look good from inside the vehicle.
Be careful if applying the trim with adhesive, as it is not designed to be removed again once in place.

, Place the glass sunroof vertically on the hinges at the front of the hole. Slip the hinge tags on the sunroof into the hinges on the installed frame and ensure the lip of the glass is positioned outside the lip of the seal. Keep pressure on the hinges as you lower the glass into place, closing the sunroof.Ensure the hinges stay connected and are engaged once the sunroof is in place, otherwise it will not be able to open properly.
Make sure the glass fits properly in the frame and does not leave any gaps.

, If your sunroof is electronic, the glass sunroof itself may have been pre-installed in the outer frame when you put it in place. If it is not electronic, open the manual bracket handle and slip the sunroof toggle into it. Pivot the handle back down to close and seal the sunroof.Test a manual latch by opening it. The back of the sunroof should pop up.
Start the vehicle and test the buttons on the frame to ensure electronic sunroofs are powered properly.

Some ""cartists"", however, prefer to leave their art cars parked, and only move them by towing to destinations such as art shows. Since you'll probably be modifying the outside heavily, it doesn't matter too much if the finish is damaged, although an additional investment of time and effort will be required to remove any rust if you're going to paint the car.;
, Themes are unlimited. You can go with a hobby, a political statement, self-expression or a commercial venture. If the car is going to be driven, it's likely to draw attention and can be a good medium through which to advance a cause or promote a business.

, During the planning stage, let your creativity run wild. Make sketches or collect swatches and samples of possible materials or colors to use. Then, choose an idea and modify it so that you can execute it.

, If your plan calls for see-through panels, for instance, it's best to make the cuts before painting.

, If you can do these separately from the car itself, they will help you to get the colors and arrangement right on the rest of the vehicle. It's also a good idea to do these first, at least the larger ones, to determine whether you're really committed to the project before you cut and paint.


Keep in mind that you can also expand the surface of the car with expandable spray foam or Bondo body-filler. This may reduce the need to attach separate large objects to the car.

, Choose a color or colors that will go with your theme. The paint can be the art in itself or it can be a background for other additions, or both. One-shot sign enamel is available in bright colors and is very durable, but you can also use oil paint (for more expression and less convenience) or even poster paint (for a temporary design).

, For larger pieces, be very sure that you secure them firmly (see warnings below). It's likely that you'll need to use bolts, screws, pop rivets or welding. There are, however, ways to attach large pieces temporarily, such as with string or rope, or even creating edges that wrap around doors and trunks so that they are secured when the door or trunk is closed.

, A car that has its surface almost covered in small objects is often referred to as a ""gluey"". You can use silicone adhesive, epoxy or liquid nails. Use the larger works to get the spacing and arrangement right.


Smaller objects can be attached temporarily with magnets. This is useful if you only want the car to be a work of art for a short time, or if there's a chance the objects will be stolen when the car is unattended.
Don't forget that if the car is driven, these items will see vibration, acceleration, and high wind. They should also be relatively weatherproof.

, If the art car will be on display after hours, you can add Christmas lights, el wire or neon tubes, which can be powered independently (battery in the back seat?), through the cigarette lighter, or wired to the battery.

, Will you add a protective coating of shellac or fill in grooves with caulk of some sort?

, Will you add furry trim or bright colors to go with your theme?

, Wear outfits that match or compliment the design of the car.

, Go to shows, parades, or just drive around town. Be prepared to answer questions! To find other ""cartists"" go to an art car parade.

Take ownership of your car search!


Get the most recent annual auto issue by Consumer Reports magazine, which is usually put out in April. Consumer Reports will give you a wide range of reports — everything from the best cars priced under $25,000 to the worst cars of the year.;
, Nothing beats a good old-fashioned conversation with a human being. Why is that? Because reports made by ""industry experts,"" while valuable in their own right, might not hit home with Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Solicit feedback from people you trust about the cars they love.

, What's most important to you in a new car? Do you have a small but growing family you need to accommodate? Look for roomy sedans and/or minivans with stellar safety ratings. Do you have a job in sales and want to project an image? A sports vehicle or coupe might fit the lifestyle. Do you plan on hauling or towing cargo on a regular basis? A truck is probably what you're looking for. Try to match the vehicles you're interested in with the lifestyle you want or have. You won't be as happy if your needs and your car are at crosscurrents.

, You've done the initial research, and maybe you have half a dozen cars you're interested in. Now comes the hard part — making a budget. Because financing is so ubiquitous these days, it can be tempting to overestimate what you can actually afford in monthly payments, as well as the type of interest rate you'll get. Making a reasonable budget based on your financial facts will further winnow down the cars that you can afford.


How much of a down payment can you make? The larger the down payment, the less you'll have to pay over the life of your loan. It's likely you'll pay lower monthly payments as well.
Decide what to do with your current car, if you have one. Usually, you'll be able to get more for your current car if you sell it yourself than if you trade it in.On the other hand, it may take significantly longer, and include much more hassle, selling it on the open market.
Figure paying about 10% in fees, taxes, etc. when you determine how much you can truly afford. For example, if you set a budget of $25,000, that doesn't necessarily mean that you can afford a $25,000 car; that's because a total of $2,500 will probably be added on to the MSRP, making it $27,500.

, The invoice price is the price that the dealership paid for the car. This price will probably be one of the most important bargaining tools in your arsenal. Still, it doesn't tell the full story. For one, the invoice price doesn't factor in advertising, promotion, display, and sales costs that dealers pay for the vehicle. And dealers traditionally only mark up new cars 10% more than the invoice price. It's possible that asking for a vehicle at or just above the invoice price will cost the dealership money. So use the invoice price, but don't abuse it.

, The MSRP is the ""manufacturer's suggested retail price,"" and it's exactly what the name implies. The manufacturer usually sets the MSRP so that dealers can still make a profit while offering customers a discount on the MSRP.The fair purchase price is a weekly-updated report on what actual buyers are paying for specific cars in current market conditions. This average transaction price is good to look at as you decide what you feel comfortable paying for a new car.
Be prepared for the market to fluctuate. Like any other market, the market for new cars fluctuates. A popular car in short supply will most likely command a price above the MSRP and even above the fair purchase price.

, Insurance is a necessity in many states, and the truth is that certain cars — sports cars, or super- or turbocharged cars — can add a hefty amount to your premium. You'll probably find it helpful to talk with your insurance dealer about possible cars before you pull the trigger. You could end up exceeding your budget if you have to tack on an additional $150 per month in insurance costs.

, If you don't have enough cash to pay for the entire sticker price of the car, you're going to have to finance. Financing means that you make an initial down payment, and pay for the rest of the car with monthly payments, which are influenced by an interest rate the lender is willing to give you. In general, the higher your credit score, the less you'll pay in interest rates. The higher your monthly payments, the less you'll pay for the car over the life of the loan.


Sometimes, the car dealer will offer you very attractive financing options, such as 0% financing deals, which means you pay 0% interest on the money the dealer gives you.These offers, however, are usually only extended to the buyers with the best credit. The dealers lure you in the door with an attractive teaser rate, and then when you fall in love with a car, say that you're not eligible.
For the most part, getting financing from a dealer isn't going to get you the best deal. Getting financing from you local lender or credit union will usually give you a more attractive rate. Unless you have perfect or near-perfect credit, if a dealer asks you how you intend to pay, tell them you're paying cash. (You don't actually have to pay cash, but you can use the money from outside financing to bankroll your car purchase.), If you've got your dream car, that's fine too, but it doesn't give you as much flexibility if you're bargain-hunting. Go to the manufacturer websites and configure your vehicle(s) with the options you want. Get the invoice prices and MSRPs for each of these cars, and print them out (along with the details of the configuration you want). Finally, look to see if there are any manufacturer incentives available for the car you want, such as $1500 cash back or a $500 rebate for recent college grads and/or those in the military.

, Take them for a drive. So far, your search has been pretty theoretical and very methodical. It's time to have fun and experience what it's actually like to test drive the models you've been fantasizing about. Here are some tips for making sure you get the best of the test drive and not let the test drive get the better of you:


Take note of how everything feels to you when you test drive, especially your gut reactions. Small problems during the test drive can be magnified later if you do buy the car, so it's best to listen to your instincts.
Try not to show any outward emotion when test driving. Your adrenaline may be pumping, and you're probably excited, but experienced salespeople will pick up on this and exploit it.

, When you call the dealership, ask to speak to the internet sales manager or the fleet sales manager. Don't speak with the ""traditional"" car sales worker, as they typically won't discount as much as a internet sales or fleet sales manager.Here's what you say:


Say:""I'm looking for a with . Do you have any of these in stock and if so, how much are you selling it for?"" Tell them you've already test-driven the car. Emphasize that you need a quote over the phone.
Start your bidding at the invoice price minus rebates, plus 1%. You can do this by multiplying the invoice number by 1.01. For example, if a car has an invoice cost of $15,000, and a cash back rebate of $2,000, then $15,000 - $2,000 = $13000 x 1.01 = $13,130.
If possible get the quote in writing (fax or e-mail), along with any options, taxes, and DMV fees, so that you can show other dealers. Confirm the price before visiting the dealership.

, After calling five to seven dealerships and getting prices, you're probably around $200 from the lowest price you can get.Call back the dealerships you spoke with and ask them if they want to beat their competitor's price. Resist any invitation to go to the dealer. Do this with as many dealerships you feel comfortable haggling with, or until the price drops below the fair purchase price or close to the invoice price.


When you've finalized a deal over the phone, ask the internet sales manager to print out and fax over a worksheet detailing the final price, along with any options, taxes, and fees. If you don't get a worksheet from an internet manager, it's safe to assume they're not ready to sell you the car for the agreed-upon price.

, In most cases, because the brunt of the legwork is done and any feints now will be easily detectable, the dealer will sell you the car right then and there. If they don't sell you the car at the rate they promised, simply walk away. It's a powerful statement that says ""I'm not here to play around."" Most salespeople would rather close a sale than let you walk out the door.

, If you don't understand a part of the contract you're signing, don't sign it. Ask the dealer to explain. If they consciously mislead you about a part of the contract, they could be subject to major fines and even jail time. Take your time to go through any contract or worksheet the dealer sends you and double-check that it doesn't contain any funny stuff.


Unscrupulous dealers will sometimes increase an agreed-upon interest or add a warranty to your car without telling you. This is illegal, and it's called ""packing payments.""It's easy for the dealer to change your monthly payment from $347 to $357 because it's difficult to spot and it's ""only"" $10. But that $10, over the life of a 48-month loan, becomes almost $500 for the dealer. Don't get scammed by packed payments.

, Ask yourself what is truly necessary and what is merely satisfactory. At the end of the day, do you really need rustproofing on your brand new car, or are you just too tired to put up a fight?

, If you see your salesperson brandishing a four-square worksheet, tell him you'll walk away unless he puts it away. Four-square worksheets are pieces of paper that salespeople whip out in desperate attempts to fool the buyer. Essentially, here's how they work:


The sheet in divided up into four quadrants: Trade-in value; purchase price; down payment; and monthly payment. The salesperson keys in on what you're most concerned about (maybe it's lowering your monthly payment), and reduces the payment in one square while increasing the payment in another.The worksheet looks logical, but it's more like a three-card monte trick. The dealer uses this piece of paper principally to confuse you.

, Shrewd salespeople will come up to you and ask you how much you want to pay a month for a car. Agreeing to a monthly payment before you've agreed on a final price of the car is a certain recipe for paying way more than you need to. Think about it. If a salesperson gets you locked into a monthly payment first, he can massage the final price of the vehicle depending on how many months he uses. That's not good. Always agree on a final price before talking monthly payments.

, People who sell cars are a different breed of salespeople. They can be very adept at manipulating emotion in order to close a sale. It's a good idea to try not to let emotion get in the way of making a huge financial purchase, especially when that emotion is being staged by a salesperson.


For example, don't let them harass with something like: ""You don't haggle with the cashier at the supermarket for a gallon of milk do you?"" They are simply trying to guilt you into doing things their way. Respond by saying that in the grocery store, you don't have to worry about paying more for milk than the person before you did. Tell them that no-one has ever financed a gallon of milk.

Often, this means knowing what you want to get out of your car. Make a list of what you're looking for in your new car.


Some criteria include appearance, performance, safety, reliability, size, comfort, fuel efficiency, cost, resale value, transmission type, engine size, kilometers, miles per gallon, mileage (if car is used), as well as color.;
, What aspects of your would-be car are you willing to budge on, and which aspects do you need to find in your would-be car? Many people say they want safety, reliability, and mileage in their car, when in fact they're looking for performance, comfort, and appearance. Be honest with yourself; it will make the buying process much easier.

, The smell. The feel. The touch. Buying a new car can be like a religious experience, but it can bore a hole in your wallet if you're not careful. Carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of buying new based on your situation:


The advantages:
Freedom of choice. You can buy the car of your dream vs. being limited to the cars that are available.
Better financing. If you do decide to finance on a new car, your financing rates could be better than if you bought a used car.
Getting new features. New cars are stocked with new cutting-edge features.
Knowing what you're buying. When you buy new, you have an excellent idea of exactly what you're getting; there shouldn't be any uncertainty lurking the background about the car's history.


The disadvantages:
Spending more money. This one's a no-brainer. You spend more money on a new car than you do on a used.
Immediate depreciation. As soon as you drive the car off the lot, it loses about 11%of its value. This is informally called the ""lemon effect.""
Higher insurance costs. It'll cost more to insure that brand new convertible.
Ambiguous information for model year. Is the model you're buying a workhorse or a defective wreck? You can't really know until later on — sometimes much later on.



, Used cars are a great deal for many people: they're relatively cheap and the consumer has idea of what to expect out of the car. Still, there are some disadvantages associated with buying used. Know them before you pull the trigger.


The advantages:
Cost. Buying that car fresh off the lot sure can be expensive; buying a similar car from a classified listings can be drastically cheaper.
Better insurance rates. Insurance companies know that drivers of used cars tend to be more cautious and price their insurance accordingly.
Less depreciation. Your car will depreciate less if you buy used, because the initial depreciation was so drastic.


The disadvantages:
Higher dealer markup. Dealers know that they can make a killing on used cars. Buying a used car usually means a significant dealer markup.
Higher financing. It usually costs more to finance a used car.
Higher/more maintenance. Used cars usually need to be maintained more often and for more money.
Unknown mechanical and accident history. When you buy a used car, you don't necessarily have any information on who drove it, how often it was serviced, or whether it got into significant accidents.



, Give yourself a budget, regardless of how much you're spending or what kind of car you want to get. Your budget will keep you from overspending and will tell you when and why to walk away from a bad deal.

, Take your criteria identified above and the budget that you've made for yourself and start looking. You can look at dealerships, car websites, or classified postings, among others. A couple things to remember as you begin shopping:


Use the internet. A car salesman's worst dream is an educated buyer: a buyer who knows what s/he wants, does not want to be impulsive, and is aware of what's available based on their budget. Searching around on the internet can help you achieve this.
Save your preliminary results. Saving the results of your research will give you a reference point as you continue to shop, especially if you choose to go into a dealer. Dealers will have artificially high prices that you can spot if you've done your homework.

, If you can, try to go on a day/time when the dealership is closed so you can browse freely and not be bothered by any sales pitches or arm twisting. If salespeople do approach you, tell them you have no intention of buying, are just doing research, and would prefer to look undisturbed. If they continue to hound you, walk away and go to another dealership: you probably don't want to buy from a dealership that doesn't respect the customer's wishes.

, This is called the ""invoice price,"" and it's relatively easy to get on the internet. Arming yourself with the invoice price lets you haggle starting low and going up, as opposed to starting high and going down. It's a much better position to be in.


Make sure you find the invoice price with all the available features you want. The invoice price doesn't mean much unless it actually matches the features of the car you're trying to buy.

, Use websites such as Autobytel.com, VINSnoop.com and PriceQuotes.com to shop for quotes that you can use as bargaining chips when you actually decide to negotiate in person. Many dealerships will also have an online branch that will get you a quote in a couple days; use them!

, For the best possible bargain, it's essential to have your financial game plan laid out before you set foot on the dealership. This includes:


Knowing your credit score if you intend to finance. You can get a free report once a year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. If you haven't done so already, get your credit score.
Shopping around for a loan from a bank or credit agency. Getting a loan directly from the dealership can be a bad idea. Get a loan secured before you walk into the dealership; the dealership might be able to beat the price, and if they can't, you know you'll be able to finance your car another way.

, A smart buyer knows that they have the inherent bargaining edge if they choose to use it: being willing to walk away. A person who isn't willing to walk away from a deal — at any point in the negotiation process — is likely a person who will overpay for their car.


A smart dealer may try draw out the process, making you feel like you've invested a good amount of time in a car, and that walking away is the same thing as abandoning that investment. Don't fall for that trap. Know that any time you spend researching or negotiating, even if the negotiation falls apart, is an investment in itself and will eventually pay off.

, Car dealerships know that they can generally make money off of people who decide to lease a car. The prevailing myth that leasing a car is always bad isn't quite accurate; if you plan on keeping the car for less than three years, it's an okay deal. But if you want to hold onto your car for a good deal of time, paying that lease will usually leave you worse off than if you negotiated to buy the car., If you do decide to take a car on a test drive, keep your emotions in check. Dealers know that people get emotionally attached to cars when they take them for test-drives. When a customer is emotionally attached to a car, they are far likelier to overspend because they are less willing to walk away from a bad deal. Some things you can do in a test-drive to temper your enthusiasm:


Ask the salesperson for quiet, if necessary. In a test drive, a good salesperson will keep talking about all the features and amenities of a car, trying to convince you it's a sweet deal. S/he's trying to get you emotionally attached. If the salesperson won't give it a rest, ask them for quiet point blank.
Bring your spouse with you on that drive. Your spouse will help you remain analytical and focused on the task of extracting the best possible value for the car. S/he could also be another BS radar, if the salesperson tries to pull a fast one.
Take your time and nitpick. If you're going to buy this car, you should very well feel comfortable in it. Don't rush the drive and ask questions that you want answered. Wait for clear answers.

, Better yet, tell the salesperson up front that you're prepared to walk away if they bring out a four-square worksheet. A four-square worksheet is a clever mechanism the dealership uses to massage the numbers, getting you to agree on an inflated price. It's a three-card Monte trick the dealer uses. Don't get scammed.

, Dealers will try to ""sweeten the deal"" (ostensibly for you, but really for them) by adding on services, perks, etc. onto the price that you initially agreed on, making you feel bad about or guilty about not accepting because it's ""agreed on."" Don't get fooled by this.


You can say something like: ""I'm only prepared to negotiate on the final out-the-door price. If we can agree on a number, I expect that number to be the final number, not the starting point for another negotiation.""

, Not all salespeople are slimy and wily, but a lot are in the car industry. Knowing the tricks of their trade will help you be prepared when you sit down to negotiate.


Don't fall for the guilt trick. Don't feel guilty for refusing an offer that you know if bad. A salesperson might make you feel guilty for ""wasting his time"" after taking a test-drive. This is their job. Don't feel guilty. They certainly don't.
Know that salespeople will start negotiating with an achingly, ridiculously high number. It's their way of ""breaking"" you, and making you feel like the number they're willing to come down on is actually a good one. If you know the invoice price (the price the dealer paid for the car), don't be afraid to walk away from an insultingly high bid.
Know the commission structure. After a ""holdback,"" the salesperson gets about a 10% to 25% cut of the difference between the sales price and the invoice price. The higher the total sales price of the car, the more money the salesperson makes in commission.

, Decide exactly what kind of car you want to buy. Locate several dealerships in the area that have that car. Call each one of the dealerships up and tell them that you're planning on buying such and such a car at 5 PM from the dealer that gives you the best price. Tell them you're not negotiating, aren't willing to come into the office until the price is agreed upon, and that you want an out-the-door prices (taxes, everything included).


The dealer may not want to play this game with you, but they'd be missing out on an opportunity to sell a car (something a dealer hates to do). Assure them that if they can give you the lowest possible offer, you'll take their offer.

, If you're buying a used car from a private seller or even a dealership, ask to take the car to a trusted mechanic to check for performance, accident history, or even water damage. Buying with peace of mind will help you find the best deal.

, Check if the car was reported stolen, salvaged, or ever recalled before you buy. You can get a full history report at CARFAX.com.

, Don't put your guard down until you've driven the car of your dreams off the lot. Make sure you understand any contract you're reading, and don't be afraid to ask questions. A lot of the time, a dealership will try to add on $10 a month or even hidden fees to wring extra money out of your purchase. Don't be gullible and trust that the salespeople necessarily have your best interest at heart.


If the dealership tries to ""pack payments"" by surreptitiously increasing your interest rate, for example, know that the dealer may be subject to heavy fines, as is it illegal.If you believe you are a victim of packing payments, contact a lawyer.

Check your credit report 3-6 months ahead of time.,
Demonstrate non-SSDI income.,
Demonstrate ""situational"" bad credit.,
Get a co-signer for the loan.,
Choose a reasonably-priced vehicle.,
Try to get a free car through charity.",How to Get a Car Loan While Living on Disability Income," It is important to have the cleanest credit history possible when applying for any loan. When you're faced with the need to overcome a possible roadblock like disability income, this is even more important. By giving yourself six months of lead time, you can dispute any errors that may be marring your credit long before you apply. After all, the credit bureaus have 30 days to investigate each credit dispute.;
, Most auto lenders require a minimum monthly income of $1500 in order to approve you for a car loan, or $375 per week . If you can offer sufficient proof of income from sources other than disability insurance, this will increase your odds of approval. The greater this income, and the longer your history of earning it, the better your chances.

, If you have recent problems on your credit report such as late or missed payments, there is a good chance these are due, at least in part, to the medical hardship behind your disability. Communicating this to your lender shows that your credit problems are acute rather than chronic, thereby increasing your chances of an approval.

, If you are able to get someone to co-sign your auto loan, the lender will look at their ability to repay the loan completely on their credit and income. This obviates the disability income problem. However, the co-signer must have sufficient income and credit and repay the loan on their own, and their credit will be impacted by your success or failure in making payments on time.

, If you look at the average price of each new car sold in the US compared to the average income, Americans spend more than 70% of their cars as a percentage of annual income. This is much too high, as most personal finance experts recommend purchasing a vehicle that costs just 30-35% of the amount you earn each year. By going to your lender with a reasonably-priced vehicle, you lower the risk inherent to your loan and increase your odds of approval.

, If all else fails and you desperately need a car, there are a number of charities that provide donated cars to individuals or the families of individuals who are disabled. Application criteria vary depending on the charity. You can learn more here: Get a Free Car if You Have a Disability.

Take inventory of the vehicle.,

Drive or tow the car to the junkyard, if you are able and feel comfortable doing so.,
Arrange for the junkyard to pick up your car.,
Return the license plates and cancel your registration.",How to Get Cash for Junk Cars," Just how “junky” is it? A junked vehicle is one that is so damaged and beyond repair that it makes the most sense to just sell it for parts.Can the car be driven or is it completely immovable? Note any areas of severe damage. Determine if there are any valuable parts to your car, such as a GPS system, tires in good condition, or the alternator.Write down everything you see and observe, so that you can give the junkyards an accurate description of the car you’re selling.;
, The Kelley Blue Book is a respected and widely-used resource for vehicle valuation.Of course, the actual amount of money you can expect for your car will be much less than the Blue Book value, as you’ve clearly deemed it “junk” rather than in good condition. This is simply a way to get a general idea about how much the pristine version of the same make and model car is selling for.


If you are knowledgeable about car repair, you can take the Kelley Blue Book price and subtract all the costs of potential repairs to get a general idea of how much money you should expect when you sell it., You need your title to prove that you own the car. Most junkyards will not buy your car unless you can prove that it’s yours to sell. When you transfer it to the junkyard, you will need to sign the title over to them to get it officially off your hands. If you don't sign over the title of the car, you will technically still own it despite having nothing to do with it., It’s easy to forget an old iPod in the glovebox or a notebook stuffed in the seat pocket. Open your trunk, check under your floor mats, and slide your hands under all the seats. Make sure that you’ve removed every personal item from the car before you sell it.This includes your license plates. These are easily forgotten, but it’s important to remove them from your car before you part with it.

, Just like with all other car-related issues, the DMV of each state handles the process of relinquishing junk cars differently. When you’re ready to get rid of your junk car, make sure to research the regulations of your particular state. A quick Google search for “Salvaged Vehicle Regulations” and the name of your state will get you started!, You shouldn’t do this until you have assessed the details of the car you’re selling. You need to describe the vehicle thoroughly so that they can give you an accurate quote of how much they’ll pay you for it.Keep a running list of the different amounts you’re quoted by different junkyards so that you can compare your options.

, Some junkyards will dismantle the cars themselves. Others will pay you more money if you do it yourself and save them the time. Ask them if they pay more if you are able to drive the car to their lot, versus if they have to come pick it up with a tow truck. Ask them exactly what paperwork they will need to see from you. Make sure you know the ins and outs of each junkyard., If you aren’t desperate to get every penny out of your car, you can choose the most convenient option. A junkyard across town may give you a higher offer if you drive it all the way to them, but you may opt for a lesser offer if they’re willing to tow your unreliable junk car. If you aren’t experienced in working with cars hands-on, it’s probably not wise to try to dismantle the car yourself for a few extra bucks. Consider which option works best for you, while still bringing you a reasonable amount of money.

, Some junkyards will give you more money if you save them the time and labor by delivering the car to them.Additionally, junkyards will pay more for a car that can still be driven and was driven recently, so driving it to the junkyard will up your cars value.

, This is the most convenient option. They’ll come to wherever you’re located, pick up your car, and pay you on the spot. If your car can’t be driven, this is absolutely your best bet. After you’ve gotten prices from different junk removal companies, you can choose the best one.


Sometimes junkyards will quote you a price, and then lower it significantly once they’ve already loaded the car onto the tow truck. This is why it is so important to know your cars value and stick to your guns.
Don’t fight the junk car towers over a few dollars, but stick to your guns if they try to offer you something much lower than what you were previously told.

, The exact protocol differs by state, but typically you need to return the license plates to the DMV in order to cancel your registration. The junkyard should have this information available for you, so ask them what is expected of you when you hand off your vehicle. The Internet is also an excellent resource, and the DMV website for your state should give you an exact procedure for canceling your registration and returning your plates."

If you have personal items like blankets, spare pairs of shoes or the like, you should remove them as well.Use a trash bag to collect scraps, loose wrappers, or any other trash from the floor, seats or ashtrays in the vehicle.
Collect your personal items and set them aside to bring inside.
Don’t forget to clean any trash or personal items out of the trunk as well.;
, Either use a shop vacuum with a long hose or take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center. Be sure to vacuum all of the carpeted surfaces in the vehicle, including the trunk and beneath the seats.If you take your vehicle to an automotive vacuum center (usually located with car washes) you will likely need quarters to pay for the vacuum.
Keep an eye out for stains in the carpet you’ll need to address as you vacuum.

, Use an automotive interior cleaner to wipe down all plastic trim components in the interior of your vehicle. If you don’t have automotive cleaner, an all purpose cleaner will also suffice for wiping away dust or any stuck on grime.Don’t use all purpose or interior cleaner on leather.
Make sure to wipe in the nooks and crannies of the dashboard where dust tends to collect.
You can purchase interior cleaners at most automotive and large retail stores.

, Use a cleaner designed specifically for use on leather when cleaning leather seats or upholstery inserts. This will prolong the life of the leather and prevent it from cracking.They make spray-on leather cleaner as well as pre-moistened wipes you can use to simply wipe the seats and trip components down.
If you wish, you may also use a leather treater after cleaning the leather. This will condition the leather deeper and help it maintain its softness and shine longer.

, Use a glass cleaner to spray and wipe down all of the glass surfaces on the interior of the vehicle, including the inside of the windshield and the rear view mirror. Pay close attention to wipe away any streaks or fingerprints.You should wash the exterior of the windows with glass cleaner after washing the car to ensure there are no water spots.

, If there are any stains in the seats or carpets that need to be addressed you can use either a spot-stain remover or a small carpet shampooer. Prior to using a stain remover on the stain, test it in an inconspicuous area to ensure the stain remover will not negatively affect the dye in the material.After you’ve tested your stain removal method, scrub it into any stains on the carpet or seats.
Follow the directions for how long to leave it on the stain and how to properly wipe it away to remove the stain completely.

, Engine degreaser works best on a warm application. Start the vehicle and allow it to run for a few minutes to bring up the temperature of the engine block and other components. This will make removing stuck on grime significantly easier.Don’t leave the engine running for too long or it may get too hot to touch.

, Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the nut holding the negative cable onto the battery terminal. Slide the cable off and tuck it down to the side of the battery. Then use some plastic bags and tape to cover the battery and any other loose bits of wiring you see in the engine compartment.While the engine likely won’t suffer any issues from getting wet, it’s better to protect electronics that could feasibly arc when reconnected.
If there are any aftermarket wires in your engine bay for things like external amplifiers or subwoofers, make sure they are covered.

, Spray the engine degreaser directly onto the metal portions of the engine and cylinder head. If some of it over-sprays onto plastic components that’s all right, but try to avoid getting it on painted surfaces as it may damage paint.Read the instructions on the specific type of engine degreaser you purchased to know how long to let it sit.
The longer you let the degreaser set (within reason) the deeper it will clean.

, Use a stiff bristled brush to scrub large deposits of stuck on dirt or grime in your engine while the degreaser works. It should loosen the grime, allowing you to remove it with the brush. Be extremely careful not to burn yourself or breath the fumes in too deeply.It’s best to use engine degreaser in open, well ventilated areas.
Remember that the engine is hot, so avoid touching it directly with your hands.

, Use a hose to rinse the engine degreaser and all of the grime off of the engine. After you finish rinsing it, look around for areas that you may need to apply degreaser to again. Repeat the process if necessary.If certain parts of the engine are still dirty, apply the degreaser again and repeat the process.
Plastic that still looks dirty can be cleaned with an all-purpose cleaner.

, Before washing the body of the car, apply tire and wheel cleaners to your tires and rims. You may choose to buy a combination tire and wheel cleaner to minimize the steps, or you may choose to purchase cleaners for each portion of the wheel. Allow the cleaner to set for a while and scrub away brake dust or stuck on grime with a soft bristled brush and a rag.Make sure to use a sponge or rag that you do not intend to use washing the body of the vehicle.
Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes on the wheels and tires before spraying them off.

, Use a hose to rinse the wheel and tire cleaners off, then rinse the rest of the car in its entirety. If there are any leaves or other debris on the car, you may want to remove them by hand before continuing to rinse the body.A lot of the dirt and road sludge should come off of the car as you rinse it.
A high pressure nozzle will help get more of the tough to clean dirt off of the vehicle.

, Fill a bucket with water and a bit of automotive soap. Soak a clean sponge in the soapy water and use it to begin washing the top of the body of the vehicle. Walk all the way around the vehicle cleaning the high portions of the body before moving lower.If it is a very large vehicle, you may choose to wash only sections, such as the front of the vehicle, at a time.
Don’t apply soapy water to a vehicle in direct sunlight or it may dry onto the paint.

, Once you have washed the entire body of the vehicle, rinse it thoroughly to ensure no soap can remain and dry on the paint. Just as you did with soaping it up, start rinsing at the top and ensure all the soap has been washed away before moving lower.Soap can dry onto paint, causing it to look duller.
Removing dried soap can remove wax and even damage clearcoat.

, You can use a towel to dry the vehicle, or you may choose to allow it to air dry. Once the vehicle is dry, use the applicator sponge that comes with automotive wax to apply a fresh coat to the painted metal portions of the exterior of your vehicle.Even if you use a towel, you will need to wait until the water dries in the small crevices all around the vehicle before you wax.
Apply the wax to the entire body of the vehicle, then give it time to dry.

, Most automotive wax will turn a white, chalky color upon drying enough to be buffed off. Check by touching the wax with your index finger. If it rubs away beneath your finger without you having to apply much pressure, it’s ready to be buffed off. Use a chamois towel and wipe the wax away in circular motions to reveal shiny paint beneath.If your chamois towel gets dirty, swap it out for another one. You don’t want to buff dirty into the new wax.

Bring it all together.",How to Calculate Diminished Value," Imagine that you have a new, $25,000 car and you get into an accident. It isn't your fault, so the other driver's insurance company pays to have your car repaired. You would think that your car is still worth $25,000 because it looks good as new. However, this isn't the case. If you tried to sell the car, you might get considerably less for it, maybe $20,000, once the buyer or dealership determined that the car had been in accident. This is diminished value, and it can drastically hurt the resale value of any vehicle.Diminished value isn't the only determinate of sale price. The actual sale price depends upon such things as depreciation, damage, the extent of repairs, and the popularity of the car's make and model.;
, Diminished value must be calculated by car dealerships and private buyers when determining what they are willing to pay for a used car. This helps the buyer get a fair discount for the vehicle if it has an accident history. However, because of the money lost in diminished value, claims are often made against insurance companies for diminished value. This means that insurance companies must also calculated diminished value to respond to these claims.


Buyers of used vehicles calculate diminished value objectively. This means that they offer an estimated value for the vehicle that they believe to be fair, given the vehicle's history. This will always be lower than the value for a similar car without an accident history. This value may vary widely between buyers and can depend on the extent of damage to your car.Insurance companies, in contract, use a very exact formula for calculating diminished value. This calculation is known as ""17c"" and has been adopted by many insurance companies in the United States.The 17c estimate methodology, by limiting the loss to an arbitrary percentage, generally favors the insurance company.

, State laws vary widely on the recognition of diminished value insurance claims. Some allow for claims to be made against a driver's own insurer, others against another driver's insurer, and others don't recognize these claims at all. They also differ in exactly how the diminished value may be calculated. Search online for your state's specific diminished value laws to get a better picture of your rights., If you've been in an accident that was the fault of another driver, you may be able to file a diminished value claim against their insurer. Again, this will depend on your state's specific laws and the particulars of your case. Contact the other driver's insurance company and inquire about a diminished value claim. If they resist or the amount is not as much as you think you deserve, there are many lawyers that specialize in diminished value claims. Search for one in your area and discuss your case with them.In any case, be sure to file your claim as soon as possible. Most states only allow a diminished value claim to be filed within three years of an accident., The easiest way to do this is to go to http://www.nadaguides.com/ and input your car's information. Fill out the various steps, including your make, model, mileage, and options. The website will give you estimate trade-in and sale values of your car. Insurance companies also use this information to determine a fair starting value for your car.This service is free to use.
To begin our example, imagine that NADA determines that your car is worth roughly $15,000.

, Insurance companies commonly divide the NADA value by 10 to arrive at a ""base loss of value."" This is, in theory, the largest amount of value that can be lost as diminished value. So for a $15,000 car, the base loss of value would be $1,500. This means that, at maximum, the diminished value after an accident and repair could be $1,500.Keep in mind that not all insurers use this calculation. Your insurer's calculation may take this calculation into consideration or completely ignore it.

, After the base value has been set, the company then adjusts it for values specific to your vehicles. The first, the damage multiplier, assesses how damaged your vehicle was by the accident from 0, which represents no structural damage or replaced panels, to 1, which represents major structural damage.Multiply the number by your base loss of value to get your damage-adjusted diminished value.


Specifically, the numbers are as follows:

1.00: Severe structural damage
0.75: Major damage to structure and panels
0.50: Moderate damage to structure and panels
0.25: Minor damage to structure and panels
0.00: No structural damage or replaced panels


For example, if your car experienced moderate damage, you would multiply your base loss value of $1,500 by 0.5 to get $750, your damage-adjusted diminished value., After adjusting for damage, your claim will now have to be adjusted for your car's mileage. Again, this relies on a set of values that are multiply by the result of your damage adjustment.


The values are as follows:

1.0: 0-19,999 miles
0.8: 20,000-39,999 miles
0.6: 40,000-59,999 miles
0.4: 60,000-79,999 miles
0.2: 80,000-99.999 miles
0.0: 100,000+So, if your car, with a damage adjusted diminished value of $750, has 65,000 miles on it, you would use the multiplier of 0.4 This would give you 0.4*$750, or $300.

, The remaining value after both adjustments is the total diminished value that the insurance company will allow you to claim because of your accident. Keep in mind that their specific calculation how produce a different number. However, this is a generalized form of the calculation that many insurers use., Try to determine the value of your car had it not been in an accident. Again, it's best to use the NADA website at http://www.nadaguides.com/ to get the value of your car. You can also use Kelly Blue Book or any used car site to estimate the value of your car or find similar vehicles for sale. Be sure to look for cars as similar to yours as possible, mainly in year and mileage, but other with certain options and in the same color.


Ignore vehicles that have been in accidents for now, but bookmark these vehicles for later if you come across them.
Be sure to also search in your area. The same car may be worth more or less, depending on where you live.

, You can begin to estimate your diminished value by using some expert standbys. For example, some law firms specializing in diminished value estimate that the value lost when a vehicle is in an accident is around 33 percent.This means that your car valued at $15,000 would be worth about $10,000 in reality when you tried to sell it. Use this type of estimation as a starting place for determining your diminished value.

, If you found any cars similar to yours in earlier searches that had an accident in their vehicle history, look at the relative prices of those cars. How much less are they being sold for than a similar car with no accident history? In addition, look at the price differences between ""pre-owned"" and ""certified pre-owned"" cars at dealerships. Oftentimes, cars with structural damage from accidents won't be sold as ""certified pre-owned."" Looking at the price of cars similar to yours sold as just ""pre-owned"" can give you an idea of what yours is worth.For example, imagine that a few cars similar to yours are selling for $9,500 and $11,000 on the used market. These cars have accident histories, but are in good visual condition. You can use this range to estimate the actual value of your own car.

, Start with what you found as the NADA or KBB value of your car if it had not been in accident. Then, consider your expert estimation and the prices of similar cars with accident histories to arrive at an actual value for your car. The difference between these two values is your estimated diminished value.


For example, using the $10,000 expert estimate from above and the two similar, used cars at $9,500 and $11,000, you estimate that your car is worth about $10,500. Your diminished value would be the difference between the value of your car if accident-free, $15,000, and your estimated lower value due to accident, $10,500. This gives you $4,500 in diminished value.

Investigate what you have.,
Establish a price for your car.,
Create an advertisement or sell your car online.,
Show off your car and yourself.,
Sell the car.,
Conclude the sale and draw up a bill of sale.",How to Buy and Sell Cars1," You need to be an informed seller so that you can provide the buyer with what they need to know. The most important information to gather is the car's title, service records and original sales paperwork. This information provides potential buyers with the information they need to make an informed decision.Other details to gather include year, make, model, current mileage, and any special features the car may have.
Receipts for regular oil changes are very also important. They show that the car was regularly maintained and help to increase the car's value.;
, The best way to set your price is by researching the value with Kelley Blue Book. There is a strong chance that a potential buyer will have looked up this number as well, so your figure should not be much higher than this. Setting the price around this level will help sell your car quickly, as potential buyers will know your offer is honest.


Many sellers believe their car is worth more than it is. Be aware of this. If you set the asking price too high, it is possible you will be unable to sell your car at all. You may consider having a pre-sell inspection that will give you an exact idea of how much your car is worth.Be mindful of psychology. Many products are priced with a number that ends in 99 or 95, as it makes people more likely to buy. Try this when pricing your car.Price your car higher if it is still under warranty or has new tires.
Price your car lower if you are looking to sell it quickly.
Build buffer space into the price. In other words, make the price slightly higher in anticipation that you will have to lower the price during negotiations.

, An advertisement is the best way to let the general public know that you are selling a car. One possible place to advertise is in a classified ad. You may want to consider the possibility of selling your car online. Websites such as ebay or autotrader have sections dedicated to selling pre-owned vehicles.


Your advertisement or online posting should include your contact information, up to 15 pictures of the car, your comments about what makes the vehicle unique, and key details such as mileage, price and features.An advertisement including this information will inform potential buyers about all they need to know.

, It is your time to shine when potential buyers come to view your car. Buyers will want to buy a car from someone responsible and honest, so be sure to appear so. Offer them a test drive, and before doing so check that they have a valid drivers license. Be aware that some buyers may want to take the car to a mechanic. If you have a pre-inspection, you can provide them with it to alleviate their worries. Otherwise, this is a reasonable request.Always evaluate potential buyers before showing them you car. Try to screen them on the phone, and if they sound suspicious do not do business with them.

, The potential buyer will want to negotiate a final price, so be prepared to stand firm or drop your price a little. You should know beforehand what the lowest possible price you will accept for the car is. If the offered price is too low, be prepared to walk away.

, To prevent yourself against any possible fraud, you should go with your buyer to the bank for a cashier's check. You will also need to draw up a bill of sale, which should include a description of the vehicle and its VIN number, any warranty that may have been agreed upon, a note if the car was sold as is, the final price, and the names and signatures of the buyer and seller.Call the DMV to check if your state requires any additional paperwork.
Don't forget to remove the car from your insurance.
Remove all personal items from the car.

Remember there are options other than selling privately.,
Research the value of your car before you go to the dealership.,
Take the car to the dealership and get the best possible price.,
Avoid making mistakes.",How to Buy and Sell Cars2," While selling privately usually means 15-20% more money for you, and it gives you the chance to negotiate directly with buyers, it can be a hassle.A trade-in is very convenient. It is quick, and you will not need to deal with emails and phone calls about your car.

, Keep in mind that the car dealership will have experience on their side when it comes to negotiating trade-ins. It is important that you know exactly how much your car is worth before you arrive so that you get the best possible value.


You can find the value of your car online at Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.
Experts suggest taking your car to Carmax for a free written appraisal, however. The written appraisal can be shown to other dealerships during negotiation., When you begin to discuss the trade-in with the salesperson, start by telling them that you have done research and know the value of the car. You should also show the dealer your maintenance records. If your car has been regularly maintained the value of your trade-in will increase., Experts note that fixing dings and dents it is not worthwhile before trading in your car. Also avoid washing the car before going to the dealership, as this is a sign that you are ready to buy a car that day and gives the dealer the advantage in negotiation."

Decide on buying a new or used car.,
Narrow down your list and see the cars in person.,
Reflect, make your decision and get the best price.,
Avoid paying cash as it is actually not to your advantage.,
Watch out for tricks.",How to Buy and Sell Cars3," Do you want style, fuel economy, interior space, safety, a car that doesn't effect the environment as much as others, or a car with a specific price. Which one of these factors is most important for you, and which is least important. It is helpful to make a list of your priorities, so you will know exactly what you are looking for., Visit the websites of major car companies and see what models they have to offer. Some companies to consider include Cadillac, Dodge, GM, Honda, Jeep, Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Volkswagen, Ford, Chrysler, Volvo and there are many others. Keep in mind that not every car company will have a car that fits you, but most will.

, This decision is a personal one. However you should be aware that there are valid reasons for either decision. Experts suggest asking yourself a few questions to help determine whether you want to buy new or used.If you are thinking about a used car, figure out if you can afford the possible maintenance and repair costs that come with buying used. Moreover, are you in a position to handle the time that your car may be in the repair shop?
If you are thinking of buying a new car, ask yourself whether you have enough money or trade-in value for a down payment. Also ask yourself if you are willing to take the depreciation hit, as new cars lose value as soon as they are driven off the lot.

, Try to come up with a list of 2-3 cars that match your needs. Look up the closest dealership that carries those specific models, and set aside a day to see the cars in person. Talk with a salesperson and be sure to take the car for a test drive. All of these steps will ensure that you are a well informed buyer.


When test driving, remember you will be spending a lot of time in this car. Ask yourself the following: are the controls easy to use (i.e. is the steering easy)? Are the seats comfortable and supportive? Does the air conditioning and heating work well? How is the stereo and does it work with your phone or mp3 player? Does the vehicle have enough power to merge on the highway? How does the car take a corner? How is your visibility? Is there too much road noise?, A car is a major purchase, so take time to reflect on the knowledge you have gained before deciding to purchase. When it is time to purchase know exactly how much the car you are buying is worth, and get the most value out of any trade-in. Always ask if there are any rebates available, as dealers typically offer them for students, military, and more.It is best to buy at the end of the month because dealers receive monthly incentives from manufactures.

, Dealerships would actually rather have you finance, so you can get a better price by financing. Think about talking to your bank about getting pre-approved for the loan you will need for the car, that way you will know exactly what you can afford., There are several tricks a salesperson may use that you need to watch for. They will try to get you to focus on a monthly payment, when you should focus on the total price of the car. They may also try to give an unfair price for your trade-in.By being well informed, you will be able to overcome these tricks.

Choose the biggest of the three online Internet sellers - eBay.,
Remember that this is an online auction, and success depends on the bidders and the selling option you choose.,
Take advantage of buying on line with eBay because the cost is all on the seller.",How to Buy or Sell a Car Online1," Of course, you must have an eBay account. It only takes a few minutes to establish an account and it is not difficult.;
, Take advantage of the tools available and add a picture of the vehicle.


eBay offers two methods of purchase. The ""buy it now"" option allows the seller to post the he will take to cancel the auction and sell the car outright. This is a good method in that it gets you the price you want for the car. The second purchase method is to establish a reserve price, which is the minimum for which you will let it go and let the auction go as far as it will. It is a gamble based on a bidding war that gets you the optimal price for your car with the safety of it not selling for less than your minimum price.
A disadvantage of eBay is that you will have to pay a listing fee to list your car and then an auction fee for selling the car. You pay the listing fee even if you do not sell the car. The auction fee is a percentage based on the amount of the sale.

, The only fees you pay would be if you use PayPal, the preferred method of payment on eBay. The downside is that you rarely get to see the vehicle you are buying until it is yours. Always check the seller's approval percentage of happy contacts. Think twice about buying from them if it is less than 90 percent.

Consider AutoTrader, which is an online seller of anything vehicular or transportation related.,
Use the website's search engine to narrow the vehicles available at the price and condition you want when you are buying.",How to Buy or Sell a Car Online2," The Internet portion of AutoTrader supports the magazine.


Unlike eBay, there is no auction part to AutoTrader. There are only advertisement listing charges, and these all fall on the seller.
You can submit your own photos to appear with the ad as with eBay. AutoTrader will walk you through the process of uploading a photo.

, Then, contact the seller and make your deal.

Get a free listing with Craigslist.,
Log onto the site when you buy from Craigslist and then use its search engine to find the vehicle of your choice at the condition and price you want to pay.",How to Buy or Sell a Car Online3," This online site is like eBay in some ways in that it has a little of everything. It is like AutoTrader in that it is not an auction. For some, this is the best way to pursue selling or buying a car without the pressure of a used car salesman.


To sell on Craigslist, it is required that you list the vehicle using the website's database. This allows you to show as much, or as little, information as you want to reveal on the car you are selling. You can either leave your phone number on the listing or provide an email address routed through the Craigslist server. Email is best if you want to maintain a certain distance from buyers until you are ready to make the deal. Be aware that, for some commercial accounts, you may have listing fees.
The standard image uploader provided on craigslist results in small low quality images to save craigslist bandwidth. For nice large images, first post to listhd.com, then post the provided html (which includes your images) to the craigslist description field.

, All that is left is to contact the seller by phone or through the Craigslist email server.

Search car auctions, classifieds, eBay, and Craigslist for cars sold by their owner.,
Use online appraisal sites to get a good idea of the base price.,
Always start the car from a cold engine.,
Check the oil levels and oil color.,
Search under the car for leaks once it's been running a while.,
Pop the hood to listen and look at the engine.,
Drive the car before buying whenever possible.,
Use any and all perceived defects to drive the price down.,
Be sure to get the title and copy of the car's registration.",How to Buy and Sell Cars for Profit1," You will rarely be able to buy a car from a dealer and flip it for a profit, as these cars are generally sold at their highest price. Random people, however, don't have to pay employees or rent on a lot, and can afford to let go of their used car for much less than a dealer can. Confine your search to these sellers for the best results.


Don't be immediately turned off by ""salvage titles,"" which are often some of the best deals on the market. Be sure, however, to ask what happened to earn the title. A broken window is a lot different than a cracked axle, but both could cause the car to be considered salvage.Carfax and other title check sites are good ways to get a cheap vehicle history for bigger buys.;
, Places like Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book let you input the car's make, model, year, and condition and see the general price. This is often a good baseline for negotiation, and can be used to effectively bargain if someone is grossly overestimating the price. These sites usually have ratings too, letting you see if the car has common issues to look for or has a record of reliability. Some tips to make the most of these sites include:


Note the ""dealer's price."" You can usually bargain down to the price they expect from a dealership, because there will be much less paperwork for both of you.
Check several sites at once, and always assume the car will be in worse shape than it is -- most people will try and sell at the highest price they can find online, and will err towards a better condition on their advertisement.

, Be wary of any cars you come across that are already on and running. It takes the most energy and momentum to get a cold car started, and you can often hear or feel any issues with a bad motor as it lugs to a start. Be on the lookout for:


Cars that don't start easily or smoothly.
Loud noises or grinding sounds in the engine.
Ticking, whining, or shaking as the car starts.

, As you do, ask about the car's history, starting with its last oil change. The lighter the oil, the better, and it shouldn't ever be dark brown or sludge-like, especially if it has been changed in the past six months. If you see any water or solid bits (like metal) in the oil, walk away -- repairs won't be cheap.


Have the seller rev the engine 5-6 times and watch the exhaust. If produces black or thick smoke you should walk away, especially if the oil levels are also low., A little water is to be expected. But oil or radiator fluid is a big no-no, and the car likely shouldn't be bought. Another good way to check this is to have someone rev the engine with the radiator cap off. If you see air bubbles in the radiator when the car revs, walk off -- the head gasket is likely blown.


Is the engine temperature high? If so, and there is hot water leaking from the car (not fluid or oil!), then you might be in for a bargain. This could just be a leaky house causing the overheating, meaning you can cheaply fix an expensive-seeming problem., There shouldn't be loud ticking noises or gurgling, and it's pretty obvious when something doesn't sound quite right. Have someone rev the engine in neutral and watch to make sure it still sounds good as you watch for any issues. Turn the car off and check the belts and hoses, looking for corrosion, rust, or heavy wear. While 1-2 belts and hoses are easy to fix, a complete overhaul could cut away any profits you hoped to make., If you're a true bargain hunter with some mechanical skills, you might buy a non-working car cheaply if you believe you can get it running. But in all other cases, you want to take the car for a spin. Test a variety of speeds and variations, ideally testing it in both a neighborhood and on a highway or road where you can get the speed up safely. As you do, pay careful attention to:



Steering: is it smooth and responsive?

Braking: Does it stop the car quickly, especially in quick-stop situations? Most importantly, does the car stop in a straight line?

Transmission: Does it shift smoothly? On automatic cars, you should be able to get into drive and reverse in less than a second and a half. Any longer delay could be a bad sign.

Electronics and Features: Do the lights, windows, and AC work? Is the odometer still running or is it stuck (and do they know how long ago it stopped running, if so?)., This is especially crucial if they didn't mention these deficits in the ad posting. Most people are honest and upfront about issues the car might have, but you should be constantly searching for other issues to use as a negotiating tool. If there are minor to serious issues that they didn't tell you, but you're confident can be fixed cheaply, you can often get serious discounts.


As you're examining the car, show them issues as you find them. Most people trust a calm, thorough buyer if you walk them through your tests and issues, making them more likely to take your word on price.
Gauge their own car knowledge as well. If they seem lost around an engine, you can use this to your advantage to play up any perceived issues.

, If they don't have a title on hand, you should be very wary about buying the car. The title is required to get the car registered, and to subsequently get insurance for the vehicle. If they can't hand over the title, you better be sure the car is worth the hassle of getting it re-titled.


For more expensive cars, use a site like CarFax to get the title history and avoid any unpleasant surprises."
"
Determine your lowest possible price and your target price before putting the car on the market.,
Get the car checked out by a mechanic and fix any issues, as long as they are cheap enough to still resell at a profit.,
Get the car as clean as you possibly can.,
Show any obvious defects to the buyer, and include them in your ad.,
Change the oil, radiator fluid, and wiper fluid if necessary to instantly raise the price.",How to Buy and Sell Cars for Profit2," Use the same appraisal sites you used when buying the car to set a reasonable price, using Craigslist and local ads to find nearby buyers. If you don't care how quickly the car sells, start the price on the high end. If you want it gone quickly, keep it on the lower end and note that you're firm on the price.Even if you say you're firm on the price, people will still be looking to negotiate.
The phrase OBO (""or best offer"") is used to indicate that you're willing to negotiate on the price, which is a good way to convince people to call you.
If the car is high value or a rare find, you might be able to make more money at an auction than a direct sale. Know, of course, that all auctions are a bit of a gamble: you might get way more than you hoped, but you could also get far less.

, This is why you must set your price point early on. If the cost of the repairs makes the care more expensive than you can sell it for, the repairs are obviously not worth it. However, if you can get a cheap car with relatively cheap fixes, you'll be able to charge more than it cost for the repairs. While buying a car that needs repairs can be a roll of the dice, smart buyers can turn big profits on small issues that the original seller was too lazy to fix.


Be sure to check online if the car has any common issues or problems. Can you do anything to convince potential buyers the problem has been handled?
What repairs can you do yourself? Older cars tend to have pages of advice on home repairs online, and more of them are in the range of a home mechanic than you might imagine., A clean car is much easier to sell, especially for a higher price. Furthermore, vacuuming and cleaning the windows costs you nothing, despite potentially making the difference between cash in hand and a missed sale. Be sure to:


Wipe down all surfaces with a clean cloth.
Vacuum all surfaces, including under and around the mats.
Rinse and wash off the exterior, including hubcaps. For higher-priced cars, consider a coat of wax to give it a clean sheen., If they know the problems beforehand and still show up, they can't use them to drive the price down. If they find issues you didn't mention, however, they suddenly have a few bargaining chips. Being honest upfront may seem like it is admitting to a bad sale, but it only brings in buyers who will be serious about the purchase. While you may be able to skate some smaller issues past a buyer without them noticing, people will generally pay more to a seller they find honest and trustworthy.


Be sure to provide plenty of pictures, especially of problem areas you noted (like a ripped seat). This inspires confidence and can help people stop worrying about potential defects., Unless these were done recently by the seller, this is a cheap way to clean the car up and raise the price. Be sure to note these services in your ad, as buyers will be happy to hear that they don't have to worry about these little hassles and are generally willing to pay a bit more.


Be sure to note the registration status as well. If it is almost up, people will have to pay $100 or more in order to re-register it, and they may factor that into their bargaining.
Be aware of state-specific requirements, like California's smog tests. If you can get this done ahead of time you can usually charge more than the test's cost, as you'll have eliminated the hassle of making them pay for a smog test.

"
Keep tabs on what other cars sell for, even if you're not interested in buying them right now.,
Look for buyers and sellers who want to move quickly with little hassle.,
Bargain like a shark.,
Bring a friend along, especially if they are knowledgeable about cars.,
Feel free to leave cars and come back later for a better price.,
Trust your instincts when dealing with buyers and sellers.",How to Buy and Sell Cars for Profit3," For example, imagine you see a clean 1987 BMW e30 sell for $2,500 at an auction. While this is far too high to buy and sell for a profit, you'll know that a similar car on sale for $1,500 might be a good investment later on. And, when you sell it, you can comfortably keep the price at $2,000 or higher, knowing someone will pay that much.


Watch or check out car auctions and car sale shows to get a good idea of prices on a variety of cars.
Check into car appraisal sites regularly and watch the newspapers for car sales even when you're not in the market. The more cars and prices you see, the sharper your sales mind will become.

, If you're working with other people trying to make a profit you're going to both be fighting for every penny. But people who just want a car off of their hands, or buyers who want a car to get them around without hassle, are going to be much easier to negotiate with.


When buying cars, looks for phrases like ""getting rid of,"" ""need to make some quick cash,"" or other indicators that someone wants the car gone, no matter what the price.
When selling cars, pay attention to those that move quickly or seem excited before they've even seen the car. Be sure to ask why or what they want the car for, as this can clue you into their financial situation. Desperation signals good deals., Buying and selling cars isn't for the faint of heart. If you want to make any money in this game, you're going to have to learn to negotiate. While everyone has different strategies, the best overarching principle is to be honest with yourself beforehand. Ask yourself two questions -- what do you want to pay for the car, ideally, and what is the maximum you're willing to pay. Start a little lower than the first number, and work your way slowly to the second.


Be honest with the seller, ""I can only buy/sell this car for $1,200 -- can you meet me there?"" If they can't, you can walk away.
Always have the cash on hand, and ask potential buyers to do the same. If you can pay right on the spot, you can often get them to lower their price to save everyone the hassle of meeting again.
Don't get emotional about this -- you're only buying the car for the money. If they don't meet your pre-planned price, get out.

, Two heads are better than one, and if you've got a friend who is handy with a wrench it pays dividends to bring them around. Not everyone knows everything about cars, but that doesn't mean you can't still make a profit. Your friend can rev the engine for you, watch the car as you take test drives or inspect the motor, and point out little defects you may miss.


In general, it is a good idea to have a friend along for online deals to stay safe.
Always meet people in a public place., Unless you are totally confident that a car is a bargain, leave your phone number and have them call you about the sale. Remember that these cars are just there to make money, so don't get too emotionally attached if they sell to someone else while you're playing hardball. If you really want to get good prices, waiting 2-3 days will help your gauge the seriousness of the seller, as well as the overall condition of the car. If it still hasn't sold in a few days, you can almost always ask to cut 10-25% off the price., If a car doesn't feel right or a deal feels shady, there is no shame in walking away. Hundreds of used cars are on the market at any one time, and your goal here is to turn a profit, not take undue risks. If you're wary that someone is taking advantage of you or neglecting the entire story, trust your gut and walk away. There will always be more deals on the road.Look the seller in the eye and ask them if you're making the right choice buying the car. They should be able to look right back at you and shake your hand.

For example, if you are an environmental charity, then you might want to buy a hybrid vehicle.If your audience is young, then you might want something sporty.
However, if your audience consists mostly of families, then you can buy a minivan or other family-sized car.;
, You can’t raffle off a car you don’t own. Accordingly, you should identify how you will get a vehicle. You have a few options:


Obtain donations. People can donate to your organization and then you can use the proceeds to buy a car. Approach local corporations, such as large hardware stores, Fortune 500 companies, professional sports teams, and any business that has expressed an interest in your organization.Ask a dealer to donate. Some auto dealers will donate a car, provided you advertise that they are the donor.
Buy with your own funds. If your organization has money from prior fundraisers, then you might buy the vehicle outright.

, You need to approach donors strategically. No one will give you money without understanding the purpose of your organization. Make sure to have the following information available for potential donors to look at:Your organization’s background: when you were established, how much you have raised, etc.
How you will showcase the sponsor. For example, will you mention them on marketing materials? On the raffle ticket itself?
How you will monitor and evaluate the raffle. For example, does your organization have an accountant or bookkeeper who will oversee the raffle and keep track of the money raised?
How you will use the money raised. Explain how the funds will further your mission.

, You can increase interest in your raffle if you also offer smaller prizes.This way, more than one person is a “winner” at the raffle. Consider offering these other prizes:


cash awards

, Some government authorities have strict rules regulating raffles. Accordingly, you should consult with an attorney in your area to discuss whether or not you can hold the raffle. You can find an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Many U.S. states limit raffles to non-profit charitable organizations, churches, or volunteer organizations.States may also require organizations to have been in existence for a certain number of years before they can hold a raffle.
Check whether you need to pay taxes on the vehicle and whether you need to register it before the raffle.
The lawyer can also help you register your raffle, which is required in some states. For example, in California, you must register your raffle with the state’s Attorney General.

, Once you have met with an attorney, you can better assess whether you want to go ahead with the raffle. Consider the time and money involved and decide whether to pursue a different fundraiser.


There’s always a chance you won’t sell enough tickets to cover the cost of the car. For this reason, think carefully before buying the car outright with your funds. If you can’t get a dealer to donate a car, then you might want to scrap the raffle.
As an alternative, you can hold a raffle for smaller items, such as vacations or cash prizes.

, You’ll want to give yourself enough time to sell a large number of tickets. Generally, you probably need two to three months if you are raffling a car.You can then hold the drawing a week or two after you stop selling tickets.

, Ideally, you want to make twice what the car is worth. However, you can’t expect to sell all your tickets. Instead, you should plan on selling roughly two-thirds.Start with the value of the car and the number of tickets you have printed.


For example, the car might be worth $50,000 and you have printed 5,000 tickets. You’ll want to make $100,000. At a minimum, the tickets should be priced at $30.
You can charge more. However, you will sell fewer tickets at a higher price.

, You can print out the tickets yourself or have a professional printer create the tickets for you. The tickets should contain the name of your organization, any sponsors, and the time, date, and location of the raffle. Also include the price.


You should also number your tickets, which makes it easy to keep track., Before you advertise, set some ground rules regarding the maximum number of tickets someone can purchase. If you limit them, you can drum up more interest in your raffle.


Furthermore, you’ll need rules regarding the minimum age someone must be to purchase a ticket and whether they must be a resident of your state. Check your state’s laws to see if there are requirements.
Also establish that no one associated with your organization can purchase a ticket., You have many advertising options. The key will be to include a picture of the vehicle, the price of the ticket, total number of tickets available, and contact information.Consider the following:


Promote the raffle on your website. Include details of the raffle and pictures of the car.
Distribute flyers. You can post them on public bulletin boards at the library, gym, and grocery store. Remember to get permission before posting. Also ask other retailers that see a lot of foot traffic.
Increase visibility of the raffle on social media accounts. Create Twitter and Facebook accounts if you don’t yet have them.

, You need people to sell the tickets and collect money. Make sure they are trustworthy. They also need to be well-versed in your organization’s purpose and what the proceeds of the raffle will be used for.


You should give each volunteer a number of tickets that they are responsible for selling.As you approach the deadline, you can redistribute the tickets so that your best volunteers can sell more.

, Find events in your community that draw a lot of people and ask to set up a table or booth there. For example, you should try to sell tickets at sporting events, the mall, and retail stores.


Create large, colorful signs to draw people’s interest to your table. Signs should say something like, “Win a BMW!” and not simply “Car Raffle.”Make sure the people staffing the table are friendly and can talk intelligently about your organization.

, You want the drawing to be an event. Accordingly, find a place that can accommodate a large number of people. The car dealer’s showroom is a great choice. Check if you can hold the drawing there.If you can’t, then another good choice would be to hold the raffle in a school gymnasium. However, you probably can’t get the car into the gym.

, Drum up extra interest by inviting your local paper and nearby television stations to attend the drawing. Ask a local celebrity to draw the winning ticket to entice the media to attend.

, A raffle not only raises money for your organization, it’s also a great marketing tool. Have someone take a lot of pictures of the drawing and then put them on your website. Also send the pictures to local news media so that they can cover the story., Many U.S. states require that you file a financial statement after the raffle. If the car was worth more than $50,000, then you may also need to provide an audited financial statement.Check with your attorney for legal requirements.


You may also have to file a W-2G with the IRS if the value of the car was 300 times the price of the raffle ticket. For example, you must file if the car was worth $16,000 and the ticket price was $50., You will also have to withhold taxes on the car if it is worth more than $5,000 and more than 300 times the ticket price. You can handle withholding taxes in a few ways:Ask the winner to hand over the taxes before you turn over the car. This often isn’t the most practicable way, since many people won’t have the money. Also, you need to tell people before they buy tickets that they’ll be responsible for paying taxes.
Increase the prize amount to include the taxes you’ll withhold. This will eat into your profits but is fairly easy to do.
Let the winner choose to take a cash equivalent and deduct the taxes from that amount.

Remove any electronics.,
Remove any custom interior parts.,
Remove any valuable or sought after parts.,
Sell your parts.",How to Junk a Car1," Experts like Kelly Blue Book and National Auto Dealers Association price the car as a whole. If you have the time and inclination, the car might be worth more if you sell individual parts. Some parts are valuable for their materials, others can be valuable if they are discontinued by the manufacturer.;
, Radios, speakers, amplifiers, capacitors, batteries, etc. are worth more being sold on their own than their weight as scrap. Take these parts from the car before scrapping it., This might mean leather seats, or just seat covers. These items can be sold separately to catch you a little more cash. If you leave them on the car you will only get their weight added to the scrap value (which will be very little)., If you take the time to take off parts that someone else might want, like rims or tires, you can sell them for more money. Also, things like a catalytic converter can be recycled at a higher rate on it’s own than what you get from leaving it in the car (sometimes even at the same scrap yard)., This can be done locally if there is a demand. You can also post your parts online to sell to a larger audience. Sites like Craigslist and Ebay have sections just for motor vehicles."

, This is usually just a title, but be sure to call the salvage yard ahead of time and make sure that they do not need anything else. If you do not have all of the needed paperwork, the yard will not accept your vehicle.

Consider your options.,
Confirm that your charity of choice qualifies.,
Talk to your accountant.,
Call your charity of choice for instructions.",How to Junk a Car3," It is rare that donating a car to charity provides significant benefit to the donor.

This means that they will have to be a 501(c)(3) organization with the IRS. If you are unsure, ask the organization if they are a 501(c)(3)., You cannot claim any tax deduction for your donation unless you file deductions on your income tax. This may mean giving up your standard deduction, which could be worth more money to you.

It might be a good idea to write it down so that you can recite it quickly., In most states, it is necessary to have insurance on your vehicle and to register it with the state’s DMV before driving it. If your plan is to drive the car to the scrap yard, you should have these documents in the car with you., This can usually be done at your local DMV office.

This is a great option if your car is not legal to drive but could otherwise be driven to the scrapyard.

Advertise in a minimum of three places.,
Advertise on a sales website.,
Utilize social networking sites.,
Post on a peer-to-peer website.",How to Advertise Your Used Car for Sale1," To bring in the most potential buyers, select three spots to place your ad. You could go all online or do a combination of websites and in-person methods, such as flyers. Make sure that you post the same information to all of these places to avoid any confusion.Be sure to update all of your postings and flyers if you choose to change your selling terms, such as lowering your asking price.;
, There are a number of websites that will allow you to post a used car ad, sometimes even with photos or video. Look into Craiglist, eBay, and AutoTrader for a start. Read over the terms closely to see if you will be charged a fee for posting, how long your post will run on the site, and other details.Be aware that some sites will clean out all ads on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. This just means that you will need to hop online again and re-post your listing every so often.
Some of the websites use a fairly straightforward classifieds format where you list all of the information and then wait for a response. Other sites, such as eBay Motors, go with an auction format. This means that your vehicle could be sold with a reserve price (a set minimum) or a fixed amount., Take a few good pictures of your vehicle and create posts in Facebook and Twitter to let your friends and family know that you are selling. Ask them to share your posts and to spread the information around. Be sure to watch your email and message windows after you post in case someone outside of your friends list contacts you.You can also network with your friends, family, and co-workers in person. Ask them if they know if anyone is looking to purchase a vehicle and give them the details in case they find someone., These sites often cater to people interested in a certain type of car, sometimes a specialty make or model. Beepi, Tred, and Zipflip are all examples of buyer-seller direct marketplaces. Be aware that these sites may require that a seller jump through more hoops by following return and warranty policies.If you are catering to buyers with more car expertise, then include additional details in your ad. You might write about any modifications you’ve made or the original dating of the parts.
A similar option is to post on an auto message board. Instead of a formal ad, you will likely need to put as much information as you can into an informal posting. Some boards will include a classified section just for this purpose."
"
Take out an ad in your newspaper.,
Post paper signs throughout your community.,
Enlist your mechanic’s help.,
Write ""for sale"" on your car with window paint.",How to Advertise Your Used Car for Sale2," Most local papers and newsletters contain a section devoted to classified listings. Depending on the circulation of the paper and the size of your ad, this can be a cheap way to find possible buyers. The drawback is that your car may take longer to sell because it’s not as visible as other options.


For example, you might write, ""Reliable Car for Sale: 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe, Red, 25,0000 miles, One Owner, Maintenance Records and Vehicle History available upon request, Asking Price $7,000 OBO, Call XXX-XXX-XXXX for more details.""

, Create a simple flyer that contains a clear picture of your car, the price, any details on the make and model, and your contact information. Attach these flyers to message boards at your office, church, grocery store, library, and even gym. Include rip-off tabs at the bottom of the sheet to make it easy for buyers to get ahold of you.Try printing out your flyers on colored paper to get even more attention. Just make sure that this does not distort the appearance of your car’s photo.
Go around every few days and make sure that your flyers are still in place. If the location has removed them, it is okay to ask if there is an approved area for posting.

, If you have a regular mechanic that you go to, tell them that you are selling your car and would like any advice that they can offer. They might even let you park it on their lot. Or, they may just spread the word to other customers or let you put up a flyer in their waiting room.Your mechanic may be able to tell you which features to emphasize, such as especially good tires or a solid alarm system.

, If you already have another vehicle, park your car off to the side of a main road with ""for sale"" written in big letters on the windshield. Then, on the other windows, write more details about the car, like the asking price, mileage, and year. If you don’t have another car yet, simply write the same information on one or two side windows and continue to drive it around.After you finish the sign, take a good number of steps back and look at it. Make sure that other people could read it from afar.

Price it correctly.,
Write a specific ad.,
Be honest about any flaws or damage.,
Provide a minimum of ten photos.",How to Advertise Your Used Car for Sale3," Enter your car’s information onto a website, such as Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds, to get an instant appraisal. Or, scour the local classified ads to see if there are other people selling cars similar to yours. Find a price point you're comfortable with, keeping in mind that the buyer might try to negotiate with you and you'll probably end up getting less than your asking price.Private party sellers generally see the best results with a price that is rounded, such as $11,000.
After you receive the online estimates, price your car between 97-102 percent of those figures.Give potential buyers more information regarding your openness to negotiations by stating “firm” or “best offer” in your ad., Provide as many details regarding your car’s condition, model, mileage, and extras as you can. The more details that you provide the fewer random buyer questions you will need to answer. Do your best to avoid cheesy phrases, such as “like new,” as they are just narrative dead weight. Read through your ad’s text a few times to check that it sounds approachable and interesting.For example, if your car has a clean accident history, then point this out and state that a vehicle history report is available upon request.To draw in thrifty buyers, state if your car has exceptional gas mileage or other cost-saving features. Also, include a brief mention of any warranties that still cover the car.

, To establish trust with a potential buyer, briefly mention any mechanical issues that might need to be addressed. You could even list your car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), so that interested parties can do some research on their own.Don’t take this too far and list everything that is wrong with your car. Just pick out one or two potential concerns to point out in your ad.

, It’s easier for a buyer to envision themselves in a car when they can actually see it. If you are posting online, add photos up until you reach the limit. If you are creating a flyer, choose one or two shots that show off your car’s best features. Include photos of both the interior and exterior, if possible.Get a bit creative and add in shots from a variety of angles. You can even include a video ad if the website will support it."

Verify that your insurance provider has declared your car a total loss.,
Figure out the actual cash value of the car.,
Compare your insurer’s settlement figure with your own estimate.,
Sign over the title of your car to the insurance company.",How to Get Rid of a Totaled Car1," An insurance company defines a totaled car as one which will cost more money to repair than the car is actually worth. If your mechanic says that the car is totaled, have your insurance provider inspect the car and declare the car as totaled or not.The question of whether or not a car is totaled isn’t always an obvious one. Sometimes your car will look like a flattened wreck, and you won’t be surprised to hear your insurer’s verdict. Other times, though, it might look merely dinged up, but the necessary repair is so costly and the car as a whole so cheap that it makes sense to declare it totaled.;
, Once your insurer declares your car totaled, they’ll come up with an actual cash value for the vehicle. This is the amount that they’ll pay in order to purchase the car from you as a salvage vehicle and should be based on the fair market value of the vehicle before it was totaled.If an accident claim was made against your policy, the insurer will first subtract the deductible from the actual cash value before writing you a check.
If you still owe money on the car, you’ll have to pay it off with this check from the insurer.

, Once your insurer declares your car totaled, you should do some research to figure out what you think the actual cash value of your car is. Use the Kelly Blue Book or a car data website to estimate your vehicle’s market value, and then subtract your deductible and any estimated expenses for the insurance company to dispose of your car once they take possession.If you disagree with the insurer’s figure, look into your policy and see if you can hire an appraiser for a second opinion. If the appraiser also disagrees, you and your insurer will go through arbitration to reach a settlement.
Just be sure that the disagreement is significant, as you’ll be responsible for paying for the appraiser no matter what comes out of the arbitration process., Once your insurer has paid you a check for the total loss of your car, they are the legal owners of the vehicle. You finalize this transaction by recording the odometer reading, date of sale, and transaction cost on the title, then signing the title alongside a representative of the insurance carrier.Once this is done, your insurance representative will let you know when they'll have someone pick up or tow away your car.


If you have a car loan, your lender holds the title to the car and must be involved in the transaction.

Arrange for the junkyard to take possession of your vehicle.,
Sign over the title of your car to the junkyard.,
Check with your local motor vehicle agency to follow up with the sale.",How to Get Rid of a Totaled Car2," The most convenient method of disposing of a totaled car is letting your insurance company handle its sale. If you’re knowledgeable about car parts, though, and think you can make more off the car than your insurance company is offering, or if the car is old and not insured, you might want to sell your totaled vehicle yourself.If your car is insured and your company has declared it a total loss, you’ll need to let them know that you intend to keep the vehicle. They’ll still cut you a check for the car, but they’ll deduct the estimated amount of money that they would have received for it from a junkyard or dealership.

, Once a vehicle has been determined a total loss, it requires documentation—usually called a salvage certificate—that effectively records its damage and history as a totaled car. You can obtain this salvage certificate by going to your local motor vehicle agency and asking them to issue it in exchange for your old car title.Different states and countries have varying salvage auto regulations, so be sure to check your particular state’s or province’s guidelines to make sure you’re filling out all the proper documentation.
In some places, the Department of Motor Vehicles will charge you a small fee for the salvage certificate. In Illinois, for example, a salvage certificate costs four dollars., With your salvage certificate in hand, you can sell your totaled car to a private party or company. A car dealership is the first place to try when doing this, as many dealerships will pay cash for salvaged vehicles in order to make repairs, auction it off, or dismantle and sell it for parts. This practice can be so profitable that some dealerships deal exclusively in salvage cars, so it doesn’t hurt to check with a few dealerships around town and compare their offers.Just be sure to explain that your car is a salvage vehicle, as this ‘brand’ or status of the car makes it more difficult to insure and sell in the future.

, If you don’t get any bites from car dealerships, check with local junkyards to find out how much they’ll pay for your salvage vehicle. Just don’t snap up the very first offer, as different yards will offer different prices depending on their needs, abilities, and expertise.Most salvage yards will have their own, set rates for buying vehicles if they intend to crush it down for scrap metal. In this scenario, you can expect around $75 per ton for your car.Also consider other factors, such as whether or not the junkyard will pick up your car for free, or if you’ll be expected to dispose of non-metal materials, such as tires, before turning over your vehicle.

, Depending on whether or not your car still runs, you can either drive your car to the junkyard, have someone pick it up, or have it towed by the junkyard. Just be sure to find out ahead of time whether or not the junkyard charges a fee for pick-up or towing.Also double-check your car before handing it over to make sure you haven’t left any personal belongings in the trunk or main interior.

, Once you’ve received cash or a check from the junkyard, you’ll sign over the title or salvage certificate to its new owner. If you don’t have the vehicle’s title, you can probably still sell the car, but you should let the junkyard know ahead of time that you don’t have it., Depending on where you live, you might need to finalize the transaction with further documentation. In some places, for example, you’ll need to relinquish the license plates and cancel your vehicle’s registration.If you live in the U.S., you’ll also want to call the DMV after a week or so to verify that the title has been transferred over to the junkyard. If the process is delayed, you could be liable for your vehicle well after you thought you had relinquished ownership."

Identify the charity to which you want to donate.,
Call or sign up online for a pick-up.,
Determine the fair market value of your car.,
Wait for the charity to send you a written acknowledgement of your donation.,
Claim a deduction of up to $500 on your 1040EZ.,
Itemize your tax return if you want to maximize your deduction.,
Attach the appropriate forms to your tax return.,
Save all your paperwork in case of an audit.,
Follow up with the motor vehicle agency.",How to Get Rid of a Totaled Car3," Many people choose to donate their totaled vehicle rather than trying to sell it or claim insurance for it. Not only do you contribute to a worthy cause, but in many places, you also receive a tax deduction for your donation. Just be sure that the charity qualifies for a tax refund: in the U.S., for example, donations to certain non-profits cannot be counted toward any tax benefits.Some charities which accept car donations are the Make-A-Wish foundation, Kars4kids, and Vehicles For Veterans.If you’re not sure if the charity you’re considering has ‘exempt-status,’ contact your federal tax governing body to ascertain whether or not it qualifies.

, Once you’ve decided where you want to donate your car, you can follow a simple process to hand it over to the charity. Call and arrange a pick-up time and location, or fill out a form on the charity’s website that designates an appointment.


If your car still runs, see if you can take the car to a drop-off location for the charity. This will maximize the proceeds your charity earns from your salvage vehicle, as otherwise they’ll have to pay for the towing service., In order to claim a tax deduction for your donation, you’ll need to figure out what the fair market value of your car is. Use the Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.com to come up with a figure. Just be sure to accurately reflect the condition, model, and mileage of your vehicle at the time of donation, as fibbing on this question will earn you a penalty if you get audited.Just because you’ve arrived at a fair market value for your car, you can’t deduct this figure yet. You can only do so if or when the charity sells your car for its fair market value and notifies you of this sale.

, Once the charity takes your car away, you’ll need to wait until they send you the proper documentation. This written acknowledgement from the charity states whether or not the charity sold the vehicle, what improvements—if any—were made, and for how much the vehicle was sold.


If you don’t receive notification prior to the tax deadline, you can file for an extension. Alternatively, you can file your taxes without the car donation and then amend the return once you receive notification.

, In the U.S., you can claim fair market value or $500 for your donated car, whichever figure is less. This is a good option if you want to use a standard 1040EZ, or if your car’s fair market value is fairly low in any case.


The charity should send you a tax receipt in the mail to help you when filling out your tax return., If you want to claim more than $500 for your donated car, you’ll need to file an itemized tax return rather than using a 1040EZ. While you will get a higher tax deduction for the car itself, though, you might ultimately get less than the standard income deduction that you’d receive if you filed the 1040EZ.For example, if you’re in the 20% tax bracket and you itemize your car donation for $2,000, you’ll get a benefit of $200. But, if you don’t have a bunch of other itemized donations to add on top of that $200, you’ll end up saving well below the standard income deduction.
This guideline holds loosely for residents of the U.S., but you should check for local and federal policies no matter where you live.

, Once you receive a tax receipt or bill of sale from the charity, you can fill out your tax return using this documentation. In the U.S., you’ll need to fill out Section A of IRS Form 8283 and attach it to your return, along with the written acknowledgement you received in the mail.If your car is worth more than $5,000, you’ll need to fill out Section B of IRS Form 8283, as well as get an independent appraisal of the car to verify its worth. Attach this appraisal to your return, as well as any other pictures or records which attest to its value, such as receipts for new tires or pictures of other upgrades.

, Non-cash donations are one of the biggest causes for tax agency investigations, so be prepared for an audit! This is especially important if you itemized your return and claimed more than $500 for the donation. Keep copies of any documents the charity gives you, appraisals, tax receipts, and written acknowledgments from the charity.Remember that any discrepancy between what you claimed for the car and what it was actually worth or sold for will result in a penalty for you, the donor, rather than the charity.

, Depending on where you live, you might need to send the relevant government agency a report of sale or other documentation. In Alaska and Hawaii, for example, you need to fill out a transfer form attached to the bottom of your vehicle title. You list the new owner as the charity and write ‘donation’ in the purchase price field.In many places, you’ll also need to remove the license plates and return them to the motor vehicle agency. In other places, such as Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Minnesota, you can leave the plates on the car.

, By visiting the SA donation website, you can enter your ZIP code and find this information.


You can also call the Salvation Army at 1-800-SA-TRUCK (1-800-728-7825) to arrange a car donation.
In the US, the SA is divided into four regions, one each for the central, eastern, southern, and western states. Each region provides distinct information for tax purposes.
If your car is subject to a loan, it will most likely have to be settled before the vehicle can be donated. Contact the SA for details.

, You will need to enter information about your car, including:


The car vehicle identification number (VIN). This can usually be found at the bottom of the windshield on the driver’s side, and in a few other locations (check your car’s owner’s manual for details).
The car’s manufacturer and model name, year of production, and color
The current license plate number
The address on the car's registration

, You can select a preferred time (morning, afternoon, evening, or anytime) for the pickup when entering your information on the SA donation website, or over the phone.


If you have any special notes about the pickup (for example, “beware of dog,” or “garage is in the backyard”), you will have the opportunity to give these as well.

,


The SA will contact you within 3 business days regarding the pickup., Wash it, vacuum the inside, and make sure to remove any personal items from the car so that it is ready to be picked up. It's not mandatory, but if you're donating it already, why not do some extra good and make it look nice?

, The SA will visit your home at the scheduled time to pick up the car. You will turn over the keys and signed title, and SA workers will answer any questions you may have.

, Additional information to be used when filing your taxes will be mailed to you by the SA once your vehicle is sold.


Make sure to record the car’s odometer reading when the SA comes to pick it up. You will need this later to claim your deduction.

, Regulations regarding vehicle donations may change from year to year. You can find the most up-to-date information on the IRS website.


You can reread the regulations concerning vehicle donations in the IRS publication “Donor’s Guide to Vehicle Donation.”The Salvation Army has also published a legal memorandum on tax exemptions.Currently, you can only itemize deductions (such as for donating a vehicle) on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040.If you have questions or would like assistance in getting a deduction for donating your vehicle, contact a tax advisor.

, The tax benefit you receive will be based on the amount the Salvation Army sells your car for.Operable vehicles are auctioned each month using the SA’s online car auction, which usually leads to high sale prices. Within 30 days, the SA will mail you information regarding the sale for you to use for tax purposes.


If your vehicle is not operable, the SA will pick it up and mail you information regarding its salvage price within 30 days.
Generally, the IRS will only allow a deduction of the price the car is actually sold for by the Salvation Army.In rare cases, you may be able to deduct the fair market value of the car (for example, if the SA makes repairs or other improvements to the vehicle before selling it).

, You can obtain form 1098-C from the IRS website, a tax advisor, or an automated tax preparation software program. There will be four copies of form 1098-C: one copy will go to the IRS, one to you, one to your records, and one to the donee (the Salvation Army, in this case).

, If you prepare and send your own tax forms, make sure to include the completed form 1098-C with your return for the year you donate the car. In order to complete form 1098-C, you will need information including:


Your name, address, and tax ID number
The make, model, year, VIN, and odometer reading of the car you donated
The date of the sale (this information will be mailed to you by the Salvation Army)
The amount the car was sold for (this information will be mailed to you by the Salvation Army)

Determine your tax bracket.,
Estimate the fair market value.,
Compare the estimated deduction to the standard deduction.,
Choose a qualifying charity.,
Make sure the charity accepts cars as donations.,
Beware of scams.,
Make the donation.,
Determine whether the charity will sell the car.,
Deduct the actual fair market value.,
Fill out the proper paperwork.,
Consider an alternative.",How to Donate Your Car to Charity," The amount you will save as a result of your deduction depends on your income tax bracket. Before you make a donation, you should determine which tax bracket you fall into.Imagine the car you donate is valued at $1,000. If your tax bracket is 10%, then the value of the deduction will only be $100. If your tax bracket is 15%, then the value of the deduction is $150.
If you don't know which bracket you fall into, you can check at http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Planning-&-Research/Tax-Planning/Prepare-Your-Taxes/Tax-Rate-Schedules.;
, The IRS only allows you to deduct the fair market value of the donated car. Since most charities will sell the donated car, you won’t know the actual market value until the charity sells it. However, before you make the decision to donate, get a good estimate of value beforehand.There are many car valuation services you can use. Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds are two of the oldest and most reputable, and they have calculators on their websites.
When you estimate the value, the estimate must be for the same make, model, year, condition, and accessories package as the car you donate.

, In 2016, the standard deduction for a single person paying taxes in the US is $6,300, $9,300 for the head of household, and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly. If you don’t itemize, you can deduct this amount automatically. In order to make itemizing deductions worth it, your total deductions need to exceed this amount. Review your previous tax filings to determine the projected amount of deductions for the current year.
Therefore, the fair market value of your car, coupled with your other itemized deductions, must exceed the standard deduction in order to see any financial benefit from the donation.
Even if you aren't able to deduct the donation from your taxes, remember that there are other psychological and societal benefits involved with charitable donations.
Keep in mind that you could give the auto directly to a needy family in lieu of a charity.

, Not all charitable contributions are tax deductible—the donation has to go to a qualifying charity or nonprofit. Usually, 501(c)3 charities and religious organizations will qualify.


In order to double check, go to https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-select-check to look at the IRS’ listing of exempt organizations. Remember though, churches are usually not listed in the directory.The only time a charitable organization won't be listed is if it a religious organization or a subsidiary of a larger charitable organization. In that case, if the larger organization is listed, you can be sure the subsidiary is as well.

, Not all charities accept cars as donations, so be sure to check before you drop your car off. If you can't find a charity you'd like to donate your car to, Car Angel uses car donations to fund a variety of projects, including literacy, children's welfare, and prison outreach. Learn more at https://www.carangel.com/programs.php.


For an alternative, Car Donation Wizard takes care of a lot of the intervening steps for you. You just pick an affiliated charity, fill out a form, and schedule a pickup. Find out more at https://www.cardonationwizard.com/.

, Although the IRS' listing of exempt organizations should be all you need to find a reputable charity, if you still have doubts, then ask to see the organization's 501(c)3 certification from the IRS, and their articles of incorporation and bylaws specifying that they accept cars as donations.You should also beware of charities with excessive administrative costs, which include salaries, offices, and office supplies. Charity Navigator, an independent nonprofit organization, actually evaluates charities for their financial health and levels of giving relative to donations. You can learn more at http://www.charitynavigator.org/.
Make sure the person who accepts your donation is affiliated with the charity.

, Donate the car to the charity you chose. You can drop it off or ask them to pick it up.


Make sure the title is signed over to the charity and not the person who picks up the car.

, The charity can either sell the car, give it away, or keep it for their own use. If the car is sold, the charity will give you a receipt, called Form 1098-C. If they don't sell it, you will not receive a 1098-C, but can still deduct the fair market value of the vehicle. The value stated on the 1098-C will depend on how the car is sold. For example, the charity might:Send the car to a salvage yard, or junk yard. This will result in the smallest deduction for you, but the quickest.
Sell the car at auction. A car at auction usually won’t fetch as high of a sale price as a sale to an individual, but it will probably be more than what a salvage yard pays.
Sell the car conventionally, which is rare. Usually this will result in the highest sale price.

, If the charity sells the car, you can only deduct what the car sells for—the amount on 1098-C—which usually won’t be quite as much as the full market value (Blue Book value). However, under the following circumstances, you can deduct the full market value:If the car is sold for less than $500, you can deduct $500.
If the car is used by the charity, then you can deduct the full market value.
If the car is donated directly to an individual, you can deduct the full market value.
If the charity makes a “material improvement” to your car, like rebuilding the transmission or painting the car, you can deduct the full market value.

, If the value of the donation is more than $500, you’ll have to fill out Form 8283, Section A. Once you fill it out, it will be filed with your tax return. If the car is worth more than $5,000, then you’ll have to fill out Form 8283, Sections A and B. In addition, you need to include the Blue Book value of the car, records of any improvements, and pictures of the car., If you don’t think the charity will be able to sell it for the same price you could sell it for, consider selling it yourself and then donating the proceeds to the charity. That way, both the charity and you get the maximum value out of your donation. Even if you decide to sell the car yourself, you still need to research the charity to make sure it's legitimate.
After you make the donation, make sure the charity gives you a written acknowledgement of your donation, which includes the name of the charity, date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution. They must also provide this to you before the tax deadline. A bank record provided by the charity would also suffice."

Find out what your car's worth.,
Prepare your car for sale.,
Market your car.,
Keep the price high.,
Be transparent.,
Sell the car.",How to Sell Cars1," Use the Kelley Blue Book to get an idea of average resale values, and check listings in local newspapers and online (at sites like Craigslist) to get a more accurate estimate for your area. Once you have a price range in mind, closely evaluate your own vehicle. Does it have dents, scrapes, or cracks anywhere? Do all the components work properly? Knock money off the asking price for each thing wrong, and add money for any desirable premium features (such as nice new tires) you can find.


Sometimes a heavily modified car is worth more money; sometimes it's not. It's hard not to ask for more when you've put in hundreds or thousands of dollars installing better speakers, racing seats, and a body kit, but there's also consumer demand to consider. Not as many people want a modded car as want a regular, production model car.
Don't forget to check mileage, too. Cars with high mileage for their age tend to sell for significantly less money than those with few miles.;
, Remove all personal effects and trash from the car (including the trunk), and thoroughly vacuum it out. Wash and wax it, shine the front and rear dashes with Armor-All or a similar glossing product, and polish the tires, hubcaps, and chrome from bumper to bumper. In short, make your car look as clean and presentable as possible.


If you want to, you can purchase paper floor inserts (the kind auto shops use when they're working on your car) to keep the floor free of dirt. It's probably not necessary unless you expect that a lot of people will be showing up to check your car out.
Don't forget to thoroughly clean the steering wheel, which has oil from your hands all over it.

, At the very least, buy a For Sale sign and display it prominently in the front or rear window with the price and a phone number visible. Park your car somewhere the sign will be seen by a lot of people who might be interested. Most people also put an ad on Craigslist and/or in local newspapers. If posting your ad to Craigslist, don't neglect to add photographs. They cost nothing and make your car much more likely to sell.


Use your ad(s) to list all the features of the car, such as transmission type, options, color, and trim. This is easy online; it requires some inventive abbreviating for a newspaper ad. Be honest and upfront about any problems with the vehicle, too, but don't make it sound like a lemon if it's not. Try to keep the tone positive.
If you don't have a public place to park your car, park it on the street in front of your home. This way, people will still be able to notice it quickly and test-drive it without feeling like they're trespassing.

, Add some money (at least a few hundred; up to a couple thousand for a newer car) to whatever you'd like to actually get out of the sale, and then let the customer haggle you down to that price point. That way, you're getting closer to the amount you want, and the person who buys your car is satisfied by getting a better deal on the car than what was advertised. Consider using the letters OBO (“or best offer”) in your listing to demonstrate that you're willing to haggle.


If you add things like “price firm” or “no lowball offers” to your listing, you'll probably get fewer responses. Yes, some people will offer you a ridiculously low sum, but you don't have to take them up on their offers, and dealing with a few jokers is a small price to pay for massively increased interest in your car.

, Allow your customers to have a copy of the VIN number so they can run a vehicle history report to check for past accidents, or run one yourself and show them a copy of the report to prove that you aren't lying about the car's history. The associated fees aren't very high. You can also allow customers to take the vehicle to their mechanic to have it checked out – just be sure that they're trustworthy.


Have your own mechanic prepare a report you can show your customers, if you'd prefer not to take a chance on letting them drive away with the car.
Carfax is another service that offers vehicle history reports. Some people prefer to be able to read a Carfax report before buying, especially in the case of later-model used cars. Depending on the value of your car, it may be worth it to have a Carfax report for it on hand.
If there's anything negative you know about the car that didn't come up in the vehicle reports, be upfront about that, too. Buyers appreciate an honest seller.

, Once a price has been agreed upon and the customer is ready to buy, complete the transaction by following the car selling rules for your state's DMV. These vary from state to state, so it's best to look up the DMV offices for your home state and learn the specific steps and paperwork required that way. One thing you'll typically always have to do is sign the back of the title and give it to the buyer. There may also be small fees attached. Have everything prepared in advance you don't have to scramble during the actual sale.


Don't forget to keep a clear and detailed record of your transaction. Write down every piece of information that could possibly be of any importance later. You might also want to get the buyer's signature on a piece of paper saying he or she bought the car, just to be safe.

Decide what kind of dealer you want to be.,
Get educated.,
Take your test.,
Purchase insurance and bonding.,
Acquire inventory.,
Advertise and sell.",How to Sell Cars2," There are two types of auto dealers in the industry. Wholesale dealers are only allowed to sell cars to other (wholesale or retail) dealers. Retail dealers sell cars to the general public; these are often (but not necessarily) cars purchased from wholesale dealers. Wholesale dealers buy and sell at lower prices, but have the advantage of often being able to move many more cars per month than retail dealers, who can set higher prices but whose overall sales numbers are more beholden to the whims of consumers.


Generally speaking, wholesale dealerships are a good choice if you're already good at fixing up cars, and can buy good cars with one or two fixable problems at a low rate, then fix those problems and flip the vehicle to a retail dealership. Wholesale dealers also often acquire cars from police auctions, foreclosures, and other competitive markets, so a competitive and enthusiastic attitude is useful.
Retail dealerships are a better choice if you're a detail person with a good head for customer service and sales. You can purchase good working cars, touch them up cosmetically with a thorough cleaning and detailing, and then make your money connecting individual customers with the right car at the right price for both of you.

, As a businessperson, you'll be required to get licensed, bonded, and insured according to state and federal regulations. In addition to a general business license, you'll need a special dealer's license from your state's DMV. This typically involves filling out some forms, paying some fees, and taking a test that proves you understand the rules and guidelines an auto dealer must follow.


The federal government's Small Business Administration offers a searchable database that provides information on all types of business licenses and permits, filtered by state or zip code and type of business.Auto dealers should be familiar with the Federal Used Car Rule, including what information dealers are required to disclose to consumers and what forms are required to be in compliance with federal law., Go to the DMV once you feel prepared, and take the test to earn your auto dealer's license. Pay any other fees you need to at this time. In most cases, the test won't be very difficult as long as you've read and thought about the pertinent information. However, if you don't pass, you can always try again according to a retaking schedule set out by your DMV.


If you're anxious about tests or have trouble remembering information, try taking notes as you read, and then reading your notes aloud afterward. This engages all three primary learning styles: visual (reading), kinesthetic (writing), and aural (hearing), which should help you to remember things much more clearly.

, An unfortunate reality of the auto sales industry is that being bonded and insured is not only required by law, but actually very necessary to prevent misfortune. As a dealer of either type, you'll be required to purchase general liability insurance, comprehensive insurance, and (in most cases) lot insurance. These help protect you in the event of theft, disaster, or an accident.


You'll also need to purchase a surety bond, which is a (fairly expensive) extra type of insurance that guarantees quality in your transactions. A surety bond protects you when you purchase a flawed vehicle from another dealer, and it protects your customers from being sold a worthless lemon of a car.

, Now that you're licensed, bonded, and insured, be sure you have a properly zoned space to sell your vehicles, and begin purchasing your inventory. Look at estate sales, private and public auctions, liquidation sales, auto wholesalers, and private auto listings to find the best deals. Use a pricing guide (such as the Kelley Blue Book), your best negotiation skills, and a certified mechanic who can perform a quick quality check on the cars you buy in order to ensure that you get the best cars you can for the best price possible.


Consumers will be more loyal to an honest lot selling solid cars than they will to a slippery salesman peddling questionable goods. It's always worth the extra time investment to be sure your inventory meets a high standard of quality.

, With a handful of good used cars inspected, cleaned, and ready for sale, it's time to get the word out. Post fliers at other area businesses, start a Facebook page, and advertise each of your cars on Craigslist and in all the local newspapers. Put up a bright, easy-to-read sign somewhere that people driving by will be able to see easily. In short, do whatever you can to promote your business.


Consider staging or sponsoring a community event, if you have the money. Host a summer barbecue party in a nearby park, with proceeds going to a local charity, or even just pay for advertising space in a student newspaper or theater program.
Don't neglect the power of the Internet. In addition to Facebook, get on Foursquare, Twitter, and even Instagram to promote your business. Update your social media sites regularly whenever you have a new car for sale or offer a limited-time promotion. You'll generate lots of buzz in no time if you stick with it.

Eventually, consider investing in a custom website with a searchable, photographic inventory of all the cars you have for sale.

Expect less money.,
Sell to a scrapyard.,
Sell to a parts yard.,
Sell to a dealership.",How to Sell Cars3," There are a number of quick ways to get rid of your car for guaranteed cash. However, the amount of money you'll make using these methods is minimal. Only sell your car to a scrapyard, parts lot, or dealership if you either have a car that doesn't work, or can't bear to wait any longer to get rid of it.

, The quickest way to get rid of a car that's a complete wreck is to sell it to a scrap metal company. These businesses pay a flat rate per car, regardless of its condition. However, they also do you the service of coming with a tow truck and hauling away your old car themselves, which makes it a tempting proposition if you've got a rusted out hunk of junk gathering weeds in the side yard.


Pay rates vary between operators, but you can typically expect to get no more than $100 out of your car if you sell it to scrap junkers. Don't ever pay for them to come to you.

, Junkyards full of stacked cars and mean-looking Rottweilers are becoming more and more a thing of the past. In their place are user-friendly, organized yards where dead cars with parts that still work can be picked over to fix other cars of the same make and model. Franchise operations such as Pick-n-Pull make offers based on their estimate of the parts value of your car, so you can expect to get more than you'd get from a scrap hauler as long as your car is mostly in good condition. On the down side, you often have to get the car to the junkyard yourself in order to get paid.


Selling to a parts yard is an ideal way to get rid of an older car with one or two problems that would be very expensive to fix at a shop, such as a busted alternator or timing belt. If you live close enough to the lot, the company might send a tow truck for you; otherwise, you'll probably have to pay for a private tow.

, Car dealerships often have good deals on used cars that you can make even sweeter by trading in your car as part of the down payment on your new ride. Dealerships tend to offer a decent chunk of change when you sell your vehicle as a trade-in; on the other hand, they aren't as likely to buy from you if you don't plan to also buy something from them.


Dealerships strongly prefer that the car you trade in is in good working order. They'll buy a car with minor problems (such as drained air conditioning), but they usually balk at cars that won't start or run.
Dealerships will usually give you an okay deal on your trade-in, but sometimes you can haggle an extra hundred or two out of it.

There may also be a phone number to call or a specific web page dedicated to explaining the donation process.


You might also use the donation wizard website at https://www.cardonationwizard.com/. You can begin the donation process on this website.;
, This is important if you want your contribution to be tax deductible. Generally, 501(c)3 charities and religious organizations qualify. You can double check by using the EO Select Check tool at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-select-check.


Remember that churches won’t be listed in the IRS directory though they still qualify.You can also call toll-free (877) 829-5500 to check nonprofit status.

, The charity will want to gather information from you about the vehicle. Have the following information handy when you call:vehicle make
model
body type
vehicle identification number (VIN)
current mileage
condition
date last driven

, The paperwork you need will depend on your state. You should contact your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and check. In most states, you will need the certificate of title to transfer the vehicle.You will have to fill out the certificate of title in the name of the agency that picks up vehicles for the charity. For example, Habitat for Humanity uses “Advanced Remarketing Services,” so their name goes on the title.
You also have to print and sign your name in the seller field on the certificate of title.
The charity will probably also ask that you submit the title before they pick up the vehicle.

, You may need to have the vehicle appraised if you intend to claim more than $5,000 as a tax deduction.You should estimate the value of the car and talk to the charity ahead of time to find out what they intend to do with the car.


You don’t need an appraisal if the charity intends to sell the car. In that situation, the sale price is proof of the car’s value.
However, the charity might use the vehicle, make a substantial repair, or give it to a needy person. In those situations, you should have an appraisal done by a certified appraiser.

, If your vehicle is accepted, you will schedule a pickup. Make sure that you are home so that you can handle any issues that might arise. Remember that the charity has up to three years to sell your vehicle.After the vehicle has been sold, you should receive an acknowledgement letter. Hold onto this letter. It contains information about the sale and can be used for tax deduction.Instead, you might receive Form 1098-C from the charity., You can also sell the vehicle and then donate the proceeds to the charity. You can also claim the proceeds as a tax write-off. Selling the car yourself would be an attractive option if you want to maximize the amount that you get for the vehicle.See Sell Your Used Car for more information.
After you donate the money, make sure that you get an acknowledgment from the charity, which should include the charity’s name, the date of contribution, and the amount given.

, Each state has its own process for transferring ownership of a vehicle. Generally, you can keep your plates and use them with your new car. However, if you want to surrender them, then you can drop them off at your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles., The IRS defines “vehicle” broadly. You can claim a tax deduction for a charitable donation of the following types of vehicles:boat
airplane
any vehicle manufactured primarily to be used on roads, highways, and public streets

, Take out your acknowledgement letter or Form 1098-C from the charity. Find out what the charity did with the vehicle. This will determine how much you can deduct from your taxes:If the charity sold the car for $500 or less, then you can claim either the fair market value or $500, whichever is lower.
If the charity sold the vehicle for more than $500, then you can only claim the amount sold.
If the charity uses the vehicle (and doesn’t sell it), then you can claim the fair market value of the vehicle.
If the charity gives the vehicle to a needy person, or sells it for an amount substantially below the market value, then you can claim fair market value.
If the charity makes a “material improvement,” then you can claim fair market value. A material improvement is not a minor repair like cleaning or routine maintenance. Instead, it is a major repair, like replacing an engine.

, Fair market value is generally the amount the car would sell for in an arms-length transaction between strangers. You can determine this value by using a pricing guide, such as Kelley Blue Book or NADA.


You must find the value for a car of the same make, model, year, condition, and similar options or accessories.The amount you claim as fair market value cannot exceed the amount listed in the pricing guide for a private-party sale.

, You must itemize your deductions to claim the tax deduction for donating a vehicle to charity.Instead of itemizing deductions, you could claim a standard deduction, which you get automatically. You should check whether you want to itemize at all.


As of 2016, the standard deduction is $6,300 for individuals, $9,300 for head of households, and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly.The amount you can deduct for your car may be less than what you could get with a standard deduction. For example, if the charity sells the car for $1,000, then this is less than your standard deduction.
However, you might be able to itemize other deductions, such as donations to other charities, which together will total more than the standard deduction.

, You will need to attach your acknowledgement letter to your tax returns if you claim more than $500. You will also need to complete certain forms:Complete Section A of Form 8283 if you are claiming more than $500 but less than $5,000.
Complete Section B of Form 8283 if you are claiming more than $5,000. You will also need to include your appraisal unless the car was sold.

The first number/letter tells the region the car was manufactured in, for example, “North America.”
The second number tells the country.
The third number tells the type of vehicle, for example “light truck.”
Many different vehicles will share their first 3 numbers/letters., The second sequence, numbers and letters 4 through 8, tell you more information about manufacturer options.

Treat the name change as a sale.,
Check the names currently on the title.,
Check for lien holders.,
Complete the form on the back of the title certificate.,
Be very careful.,
Take your forms to the DMV.,
Change the title to match your divorce settlement agreement.,
Treat a gift as a transfer and correct the title accordingly.,
Correct the title to show a donation to charity.,
Decide what additional forms may be needed in case of a death.",How to Take a Name off a Car Title," The person whose name is being removed from the title should complete the sections on the back of the title certificate as though he or she were selling the car. The other person, whose name is remaining on the title, will be listed as the buyer. The new “buyer” will then take the completed title to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and complete the steps for issuing a new title., It makes a legal difference if the names appear on the title joined by “and,” “or,” or sometimes “and/or.” If the names are joined by “and,” then both named individuals will have to sign the title as “seller” make the transfer to the one person who is going to remain. If the two names are joined by “or” or by “and/or,” then either person alone can legally complete the transfer.Suppose, for example, that two friends want to start a band and travel the country together in a van. They buy the van together, and the title lists the owners as “John Smith or David Roberts.” If the band breaks up someday, either John or David could change the title into his own name without requiring a signature of the other one. (This example is just given to show the technical importance of the names. If this actually happened, however, the band member who got left out might have a law suit against the other one for half the value of the van.)
Be careful. At least one state, Arizona, treats the “and/or” differently. In Arizona, for example, if the names on the title are listed as A “and/or” B, then it is treated the same as “and,” and both people must sign the transfer., If the original title has one or more lienholders listed, then you have two options – either pay off the loan in full, or get the lienholder to agree to the change. If you cannot pay off the loan, and the lienholder does not agree to the change, then you will not be allowed to make the name change at this time., Fill in all the spaces as though you were selling the car. The “seller” is the person whose name is coming off the title. The “buyer” is the person whose name is going to remain., It is important to fill out the form completely and neatly. In some cases, if you make a mistake and cross out your error, the Department of Motor Vehicles may not accept the form. You would have to request a completely new title, and then start the transfer over again.Some states require that the signatures be notarized. Find out ahead of time if this applies to you and do not complete the form until a notary is present.
Some states require that you complete the forms at the DMV in person. Find out if this applies to your state as well. Call ahead and see if it is possible to make an appointment, so that you can reduce the amount of time that you’ll need to wait.

, In most cases, a transfer must be done in person at the DMV. In some states, you may be able to submit the paperwork by mail. Call your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles or check their web site online to find out which of these situations applies to you.

, As part of the divorce, you need to decide who will keep the car, and who will be responsible for the payments, if there are any. Usually, these are the same. But after a divorce, things can get different. For example, you may agree that one party will continue paying the loan and insurance, while the other party will get full ownership of the car. Make the changes to the title to fit your agreement.In most cases, a transfer is treated as a sale, and the state is likely to charge a sales tax when the title is changed. However, in the event of a divorce, some states may waive this tax if you present a divorce order along with the application for the new title. You will have to check with the registry in your state to see what applies to you., Suppose the original title had two individuals’ names on it, say a parent and child. At some point, the parent chooses to give the car completely to the child as a gift. This will require having the parent remove his or her name from the title as described in this article. Complete the form as a transfer, with the sale price as $0. This may avoid a sales tax or use tax., Many people choose to donate vehicles, particularly older ones, to charities. This will allow them to take the value of the car as a tax deduction, as long as the organization is a recognized 501(c)(3) charity. If you are doing this, complete the title the same as any other transfer, but put the name of the charity or it authorized representative as the “buyer,” with a sale price of $0. You will then give the completed paperwork to the charity. The charity will be responsible for completing the work with the DMV in order to transfer ownership.

, In case one owner on the title of a car passes away, the remaining owner will need to consider whether additional papers are needed, or even if any additional steps are necessary.


If the title was in both spouse’s names, the surviving spouse can generally submit the original title with a copy of the death certificate.
If the vehicle was left to someone in a will, then the executor of the estate will need to submit an affidavit or certificate along with the title.
In any event, it will probably be advisable to get a probate attorney involved to make sure that the transfer is completed properly."

Work with the dealer.,
Pay the fees and taxes.,
Verify the accuracy of the names on the title.,
Collect the title (or not).",How to Transfer a Car Title1," In most cases, when you are buying a car from a professional dealer, the dealer will take care of all the paperwork. Follow the dealer’s instructions. In some states, you may need to get some additional paperwork from your insurance company, for example, before the dealer can complete its work., In addition to the purchase price for the car, you will be responsible for sales tax, registration fees, and a title fee. These costs will be different from one state to the next. , The title certificate is the document that identifies the owner or owners of the car. It is important to get it right. Make sure that you proofread the names on it. If this is a car for a teenager, for example, consider whether you want the parent to own the car, or the child, or both. If it is for a married couple, consider how you want the names to appear.


In some states, if a married couple’s names appear on the title as “John Smith and Mary Smith,” for example, it has a different legal meaning than “John Smith or Mary Smith.” Using “and” means that any future transfer would require both people’s signatures. Using “or” is a looser partnership, and means that each person owns half of the car and could transfer his or her half of the car.Talk with the dealer about the difference at the time of the purchase.

, If you are paying the full price for the car, you should receive the title from the dealer or the Registry of Motor Vehicles within about 30 days. However, if you are buying the car with a loan, then the lender’s name will appear on the title as a “lienholder.” This means that the lender has certain rights to control what happens to the car, at least until you pay off the loan. In many states, if a lienholder appears on the title, then the title will either go to the lienholder or will be held by the Registry until the loan is paid off. When the loan is paid in full, then the lienholder will be removed and you will receive the actual title certificate."

Signatures of both buyer and seller. If the title has more than one name as the original owner, you will probably need both of them to sign the bill of sale., The title certificate itself will contain spaces, usually on the back, for you to complete with the details of the transfer. Be sure to read the instructions very carefully. In some states, you may actually have to take the title to the Registry of Motor Vehicles, with both the buyer and seller in person, in order to complete this step., If the original title listed one or more lienholders, you will either need to pay off that loan before making the transfer, or you will need to get a certificate signed by the lienholder assenting to the transfer., In most states, the buyer is responsible for requesting a new title and registration for the car. There is usually a brief time limit, approximately 30 days, to complete this. The buyer should check with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in his or her state for the exact procedure."

It is important, however, to identify a reputable charity that deserves your support. Be sure that the charity has 501(c)(3) tax status, so that you can receive a tax deduction for the donation., If the title is in the name of two people, both will be needed to make the transfer. If the title is in someone else’s name (a parent, child, etc.), you will need to have that person make the donation, or transfer the title and then make the donation. If you do not have the title certificate, you will need to request a duplicate from the Registry of Motor Vehicles., Some charities will suggest that you simply hand over the title certificate and let them take care of the paperwork. While this sounds helpful, don’t do it.For the transfer to be valid, you need to:


Complete the transfer information on the back of the title certificate.

It is not connected to any state’s official department of motor vehicles, but it provides useful information, such as web sites, addresses and telephone numbers for each state’s official DMV. Go to DMV.org and select your state from the ""Choose Your State"" drop-down menu, or scroll below the map of the United States and click on the name of your state. You will then be taken to a page that contains links for your state's DMV website and the application for replacing your car title.;
, If you do not have Internet access, refer to your local phone directory or visit any full-service DMV office in person to obtain a copy of the application needed to replace your car title.

, If you prefer, you can usually call the DMV for your state and have an application mailed to you. Be sure to specify that you need the application for a lost or replacement title, as opposed to an original title for a new car. They will be different.

, Most states will require you to pay fees and bring forms of personal identification and information specific to your car, such as insurance and registration. You can usually find out what you need very easily by checking your state’s DMV web site, or by calling the customer service number for your DMV.

, Most states will charge a fee for replacing the Certificate of Title, but it will be nominal. In Texas, for example, if you apply by mail, the fee is $2; if you apply in person, it is $5.45.In California, a replacement title is $20,while in Massachusetts it is $25.You will want to find out ahead of time what your state’s fee is.

, In order to request a duplicate title, in most states, you will have to show your driver’s license, or provide the driver’s license number if you are applying online. You will also need the car’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), which is usually available on your registration paperwork. Be careful to report the VIN precisely, as it is a long combination of numbers and letters. One mistake will delay your efforts to replace your title.You can also find the VIN on the car itself by looking for the metal tag in the far front left corner of the dashboard, just under the windshield.

, The information you are required to provide will vary depending on your state's DMV policies. Be sure to provide all information carefully and accurately. The Certificate of Title is the single document that demonstrates your ownership of your car, and even minor errors can cause serious complications later if you want to sell or transfer the car. Application forms generally will ask for some or all of the following information:


Name (this should be printed exactly as it appears on your registration)
Address. The DMV in most states will only mail the new Certificate of Title to the address that is already on file in their records. If you are at a new address, you will first have to complete the procedure for changing your address.Contact information
Driver’s license number

, Most of the information that you will need for a duplicate title can be found in your registration or insurance paperwork. Some examples of typical requests are:


Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
License plate number
Your car's make, model, and body color
Original title number, if available
Current odometer reading

, In some states, the lien-holder may be required to be the one to submit the application. For example, in Illinois the Certificate of Title will only be mailed to the lien-holder, if there is one. If not, it will be mailed directly to the owner., You can indicate whether your car title was lost, stolen, or damaged, or you may provide an alternate explanation. In some states, if the reason for the duplicate is that the original certificate was damaged, you will be expected to return the damaged certificate along with your application.

, In some cases, you may be required to sign the application in front of a DMV representative or sign it in front of a Public Notary before submitting it to the DMV. Call ahead or check your DMV web site to see if this is a requirement for your state.

, After the DMV has received your application for the replacement car title, they will issue the new title. In order to protect against fraud, most states will not mail out the replacement title for 15 to 30 days."

Know what the VIN looks like.,
Try looking for the number through the car's insurance information (vehicle insurance card or insurance policy).,
Check the car's registration card or sticker.,
Check the car itself.,
Use a government based title search.,
Choose a car title provider, carefully.,
Expect to receive a report.",How to Do a Car Title Search," A ""Vehicle Identification Number"" (VIN) is 17-digits and made up of numbers and letters; the number is unique to that specific car.;
, Almost every state in the US requires that a car be covered by insurance to drive it on the road. So, if somebody is currently driving it, they will most likely have insurance and a insurance card with the VIN.

, These stickers usually go on the front windshield, on the driver's side (the left side in the US).

, The number can be located in many places, so you may need to hunt around. Look in such places as on the driver's side below the windshield, driver's side door/door jamb, the front of the engine block and the front end of the frame. It may look like a sticker, a small metal plate or an engraving.


Where the VIN number is placed depends on the year and manufacturer of car, so it might be good idea to do an internet search for the VIN using the manufacturer and year.

, In some countries, such as the United States, you can check a used vehicle's history through an online database. For example, in the USA, you can use the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, at http://www.vehiclehistory.gov/. Click on ""Check Vehicle History"" to find an approved provider.


Some US States offer title search databases. Be aware that this search may have limitations if the car has a history outside of the jurisdiction in which you're searching.

, These services aren't free, so it is important to find a site that you trust, since you're giving them your information. This is why it's recommended that you use a service that has been approved through a government body's site (a government site will have "".gov"" somewhere in the URL).


Follow through with the directions on the title search site. This will require you to have your VIN number ready (see step 1).
Checking a provider's reputability through the Better Business Bureau is also recommended.

, This report should give you information concerning whether the car has been rebuilt, salvaged, spent time in a junk yard, returned to the manufacturer or had its odometer changed to an incorrect mileage.

Subscribe to an online information search website.,
Hire a private detective.,
Another option is to hire a certified information broker.",How to Check Car Plate Numbers," To do the most basic type of search, you will need to search for the state's DMV website online.

In almost all cases, the quality of the information you get is not guaranteed. You could end up with a first name, last name, phone number, address or any combination of personal information, large and small.

, The Driver's Privacy Protection Act allows private detectives to use databases that track license plates. Licensed private detectives may charge between $100 and $1,000 for this service, but they are more likely to get results.


Hiring a private detective can be a costly option, but it is usually a 1-time fee. Ask the detective to guarantee the information you desire when you agree to a fee.

, Similar to the services held at online agencies, these brokers are researchers that can yield results using public records and other services for a fee. Check online listings and the local phone book for this service.

Before you buy the car, it is owned by the dealership or the manufacturer. Once you purchase the vehicle, title needs to be transferred into your name.


When you buy a car from a dealership, they will make this transfer for you. All you need to do is show a valid driver license.Therefore, if you buy a car from a dealer, getting title in your name is as easy as completing the purchase.;
, A lot of cars are bought from private sellers. Private sellers are people selling a car that are not associated with any dealership. For example, if you buy a car from your neighbor, you are buying from a private seller. When you buy a car from a private seller, you will pay the seller a certain sum of cash (or you will exchange property) in exchange for the vehicle. The seller will have to provide you with certain documents (e.g., bill of sale), signatures, and certifications. Each state will have different requirements.Check with your local DMV if you have any questions.


When your purchase is complete, you will have to start the title transfer process.

, A vehicle can also change owners if you inherit it, which means you get it from someone who passed away. If this happens, the estate's executor or administrator will inform you that the deceased has gifted you a car. The administrator will have taken certain steps to start the transfer process.Once you inherit the vehicle, you will have to start the title transfer process.

, Some people want to have another person's name added to their vehicle's title. For example, if you and your spouse just got married, your spouse might want to add you to their car's title. This act is also considered a transfer of ownership and will require you to go through the title transfer process., Each state has different requirements for transferring a car title into your name. For this reason, it is important that you research the specific requirements in your state. Your state DMV website should contain a detailed description of the process, including what forms you need and what information you need to gather. However, if you cannot find the information you are looking for online, visit your local DMV office in person.


When you search your state's DMV website, try looking for some of the following terms and keywords: selling/buying a vehicle, transferring title, transferring ownership, change in ownership. If you can find information about these topics, you will be well on your way to getting title in your name.

, Once you buy a vehicle or the vehicle is in some other way transferred to you, you must work quickly to get title in your name. Every state requires you to transfer title into your name within a set time frame. If you submit your transfer documents late, you will have to pay a late fee.For example, in Washington, you have 15 days to transfer title into your name after you buy or get a vehicle as a gift. If you transfer title into your name after the 15 days, you will have to pay penalties., The federal government requires you to disclose the odometer reading on your vehicle to the DMV when you take ownership of it. The only times you will not have to make this disclosure is if the car is over 10 years old, it is a commercial vehicle with a weight of more than 16,000 pounds, or if it is being transferred prior to its first sale by a dealer (e.g., the car is being transferred from manufacturer to dealer).To make this disclosure, you will need to obtain a specific form from your state DMV. The forms are not usually available online, through email, or through fax because it is printed on tamper proof paper.
To get a copy, pick one up at your local DMV, send a request to your local DMV, or call your local DMV. If you do not pick the form up in person, it will be mailed to you within a couple of days., In a lot of states, when a car transfers owners, a smog or emissions test must be conducted. These reports provide the DMV with information about how your car's engine is working and whether the vehicle is a pollution hazard. Each state that requires these reports will handle them differently. For example, if you live in Washington, the buyer will have to get an emissions testing report if they live in certain counties.In California, however, the seller is responsible for obtaining a smog certification prior to transferring ownership to you.If you, as the buyer, are responsible for obtaining an emissions report, you will most likely have to pay a fee to have it done. The fees will vary but usually range from about $30 to $100.

, When a private seller transfers ownership of a car to you, they must give the DMV notice of that transfer. This notice must be given within a few days after the transfer takes place. In California, for example, the seller must submit the notice and release of liability within five days after transferring ownership to you.Make sure the seller completes this step so the title transfer process can go smoothly.


If the seller lost the title, they will have to fill out an affidavit swearing under oath that they are the owner of the vehicle and that they have the right to transfer ownership to you.Make sure this is done before you submit your title transfer documents to the DMV.

, The bill of sale is a form that you and the seller will fill out jointly when ownership is transferred. However, the bill of sale does not transfer title and does not act as a notice of transfer. It is meant to help both parties gather required information. The bill of sale will include the seller's personal information, the buyer's personal information, and information about the vehicle.Bill of sale forms can usually be found online at your local DMV website. If you are having trouble finding the form, contact the DMV.

, The title application is the main form you will use to transfer the car's title into your name. Most DMV websites will have this form available for you to download and print.If you need help obtaining a copy, call your DMV. In addition to finding the form, see if you can find directions on how to fill it out. These forms often ask for a lot of information that is either not required or that you will not readily know. Once complete, have the form signed in front of a notary. In general, the title application will ask you for the following information:The vehicle's license plate number
The car's color
VIN number
Model year
How the car is powered (e.g., gas, diesel, hybrid)
Use (e.g., passenger, truck, motorcycle)
Make
Body type (2-door, 4-door, pickup, convertible)
Weight
Mileage
Your name as you would like it to appear on the title

, Before you go to the DMV to submit your documentation, you need to get proof of insurance. This will need to be taken to the DMV along with everything else. Each state will have different insurance requirements and different ways of showing proof. For example, in North Carolina, you can offer proof of liability insurance by showing any one of the following:A specific form from your insurance agent
Your vehicle's insurance policy
An insurance binder
An insurance card

, Most, if not all, state DMVs will require you to submit your title application and attachments in person. Find the DMV that is most convenient for you and find time to go. Some DMVs will allow you to make appointments so you do not have to wait in line. Regardless, leave yourself plenty of time to complete the process. Going to the DMV can often take hours.

, Once your number is called at the DMV, move to the proper counter and tell the employee that you need to file a transfer of title application. The employee will ask you for specific information, all of which you should have on hand. In general, you will be required to submit the:Bill of sale
Title application
The current title
Emissions testing report
Affidavit of loss
Odometer disclosure statement

, Once you submit all of your documentation, the DMV employee will determine what types of fees you owe and how much the total application will cost. The cost of transferring title will vary greatly from state to state. In addition, some states require you to pay other fees in addition to transfer fees. Also, if you were late filing, you will have to pay a late fee. In California, for example, you may be required to pay one or more of the following fees:Transfer fee
Use taxes (based on where you live)
Registration renewal
Planned non-operation
Duplicate title

, Once your forms have been submitted and your fees paid, the DMV will process your application and sen you a new title with your name on it. The wait time to get your new title will vary depending on what state you live in and what type of application you filed. For example, in Washington, you can expect your new title eight to ten weeks after you submit your paperwork. However, if you paid extra to have the application review expedited, you will receive your new title sooner."

Know the limitations of the information you can get for free.,
Understand the contents of a full report.,
Investigate a free report from VehicleHistory.com.,
Decide if you need to purchase a full report.",How to Check Vehicle History for Free1," The Internet has many commercial sites that provide VHRs. The free information, however, is limited. For example, CarFax advertises a free “myCarFax.com” report, which provides your car’s service history, upcoming service alerts, and information about recalls.Other sites with free reports provide similar information that is based generically on your car’s make and model, but is not specific to the car’s VIN. Free reports typically provide the following generic information:manufacturer
model
manufacturing details, such as chassis type, engine size, country of assembly, and engine power
a general summary of what the full report would contain if you choose to purchase it.;
, The five most commonly used sources for purchasing a VHR are CarFax, AutoCheck, the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS), which has two different sources.A full VHR, which you can usually purchase for a fee that ranges between $10 and $40, includes the following information about the specific car, based on its VIN:ownership history
clean title/ownership verification
periodic odometer readings
maintenance records
history of rental or lease
accident repair history
flood repair history

, Until recently, full VHRs have only been available for purchase. As of December 2015, however, a source called Vehicle History (web address www.VehicleHistory.com) is offering a full VHR for free.The report from Vehicle History contains the following information:vehicle ownership records
vehicle information
government records
public records
background history
historical records
state records

, If you are considering the purchase of a used car, the information that is available in a full report is generally worth the cost of the purchase. Purchasing a full VHR is usually less than $50, which is very small compared to the price of the car itself. As Consumer Reports points out, even if a mechanic tells you that the car is in good condition, the history of an accident, flood damage, or some similar incident in the car’s history can greatly reduce its value.VehicleHistory.com appears to offer a full report for free. However, this is a relatively new resource, and less has been written about the validity of VehicleHistory.com than the other sources. Consumer Reports recommends that buyers consider comparing reports from multiple sources."

Demonstrate your interest in a car.,
Request that the dealership pay for the VHR.,
Assess the dealership’s response.",How to Check Vehicle History for Free3," Before requesting that the dealership or previous owner pay for a VHR, demonstrate that you are a serious buyer. Devote your attention to one car instead of several cars on the lot. Talk to the salesperson about the vehicle and your financing options. Take the car for a test drive. Have the car looked over by a trusted mechanic., Dealerships often subscribe to a VHR service. This allows them to run VHRs economically on every car in their inventory. After demonstrating your interest in a vehicle, express your interest in the car to the salesperson and indicate that you have a few reservations. Indicate that the dealership’s willingness to pay for the VHR would ease your remaining concerns about making the major purchase.When talking to the salesperson, you could say: “I really love this car but I have a few reservations. My last car was in the shop all of the time and I want to make sure this vehicle doesn’t have a long history of repairs. In order to commit to the car, I need to see a detailed vehicle history report. This would really ease my concerns. Would you be willing to provide me with one?”
Wait until you are close to purchasing the car to request a VHR. A dealer is unlikely to run these reports on a number of vehicles.

, If the salesperson willingly runs the VHR for you, thank the salesperson! If the salesperson refuses to run the VHR or hands you an outdated VHR, proceed with caution. These red flags indicate that the dealership is hiding something about the car’s history. Walk away from the sale or pay for a complete VHR."

The NICB no longer reports if the vehicle has a lien on it (as they did before), so be sure to verify with the DMV that the title belongs to the person selling the vehicle.

, If the vehicle in question was made after 1981 but has fewer or more than 17 numbers and letters in its VIN, it's generally a pretty good sign that the VIN has been faked. Stay away from purchasing this vehicle if possible.

Sometimes, sellers will do potential buyers a favor by paying for it themselves, saving the PDF or printout, and sending a copy over to would-be buyers.
Always keep your eyes and ears open and be cautious, since sellers could doctor the VIN Check and try to mislead you. When you're dealing with a purchase that ranges in the thousands of dollars, it's easy to be penny wise and pound-foolish.

Your DMV should have an application you can complete for requesting a duplicate title. The application or form might be available online.
You might not have the title because you haven’t paid off your car loan.In that situation, you need to work with your lender to pay off your loan before you will receive the title. Once paid, you can submit a lien clearance letter or other release form to the DMV to get the lien removed.If the car has a lien, then the duplicate will probably be sent to the lienholder, so it is best to take care of the lien before making the sale.;
, Every state is different, and you need to follow your state’s requirements. Your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles can explain the process.


You can find your DMV online. Type “your state” and then “DMV.” Look for a link that explains transferring title.
You can also find the specific rules and regulations in your state regarding title transfer here: http://www.dmv.org/title-transfers.php. Click on your state. This website isn’t affiliated with any state government. However, they provide links and contact information to state offices.

, Fill out the basic information about the sale of the car. Depending on your state, you will provide the information on the front or the back. Once completed, give the form to the buyer. You generally must provide the following information:names of the buyer and the seller
signatures
notary’s signature (in some states)date of sale
price
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
odometer reading (though in some states this is a separate form)

, In many states, the buyer will need a Bill of Sale that shows the purchase price. You should check with your state’s DMV, which may have a state-specific Bill of Sale form for you to complete.If your state doesn’t have a form, you can create your own. It should contain a description of the vehicle, VIN, final sale price, place of sale, and the names of both buyer and seller.
If the seller made any warranties, those should be included in the Bill of Sale as well.

, You need to notify the DMV that you no longer own the vehicle. This can protect you in the event the new owner gets into an accident while the car is still registered to you. Your DMV may have a Release of Liability or Notice of Transfer form you can use. Fill it out and submit it to the DMV as soon as possible. Typically, you will asked for the following information:VIN
description of the vehicle, such as its make, model, year, and color
date of the sale or title transfer
license plate number
odometer reading
new owner’s name and contact information
your name and contact information

Gather required documents.,
Apply for a new title at the DMV.,
Register your car.",How to Fill Out a Car Title Transfer2," Make sure the title has been filled out correctly before completing the purchase. Verify the mileage, as filled out on the title. The form needs to include:


names of buyer and seller
date of sale
odometer number
VIN number
any other information necessary to the sale of the car

, A lien is a legal interest in a piece of property. Typically, you grant a lien to another party to secure a debt. However, sometimes people can get a court to grant them a lien in a car.


Most liens are held by the bank that gave the seller their car loan. The car is used as collateral for the loan. In that situation, the bank probably has held onto the title and the only way the seller can get the title is to pay off the lien.
However, a seller could have other liens on the car. Accordingly, don’t assume that there are no liens on the car simply because the seller has title. For example, a child support lien might have been placed on the car. Alternately, a mechanic could get a lien on the car for unpaid repairs. If you buy the vehicle with the lien on it, you now become responsible for the lien.If you have the VIN, you can check for liens at your DMV. This is a critical step, so don’t neglect it.

, Your state probably also requires that you sign the back of the title along with the seller.You should sign only after you have verified the information on the title and checked for liens.


Ideally, you should go with the seller to the DMV office and fill out the transfer form together there. Even if not required by the state, going together can protect you because you can check for liens while you are there.The DMV should also have a notary public in the office, in case your state requires that your signatures be notarized.

, You’ll need certain information to have the vehicle transferred into your name. Contact the DMV and ask what you will need. Generally, you’ll need the Bill of Sale showing the purchase price and the signed title.You’ll also need the VIN and current odometer reading, which should be on the title form. In some states, the odometer reading will be written on a different form.

, Take the completed title and visit your local DMV office. You will need to complete paperwork at the office to transfer the title to you.You can call ahead of time to ask what information you need.


You typically must pay a fee for the title transfer, which will vary by state.
You must turn over the title. Your state should send you a new title in the mail.

, You can typically register your car when you transfer the title, usually at the DMV. To register, you’ll need the following documents:proof of insurance
proof that you’ve paid sales tax
certificates showing the car has passed safety and emissions inspections

Do your research.,
Determine what documents are required.,
Make sure you possess the right to sell.,
Locate a notary public.,
Schedule an appointment with the notary.

,
Determine who needs to be there.,
Take the required items to your notary appointment.,
Sign the title in front of the notary.,
Have the notary sign and seal or stamp the title.,
Pay the Notary fee.",How to Notarize a Car Title," Each state has its own procedures, and the differences can be substantial. A number of states require no notarization of auto sales, while others have rather lengthy lists of requirements. You can find out more about your state here.;
, While you obviously must bring proof of ID, notaries are not just providing validation for the signature but are in fact guaranteeing that each side is prepared to live up to the contract. Additionally, in some states the title itself becomes a legal contract, while in other states there are separate applications associated with title transfers (North Carolina, for example, has a separate form that requires notarization ).

, This may sound obvious, but again there are notable differences between states on who possesses the right to sell.


Minors often do not have the right to sell a vehicle without the authorization of a parent or guardian, regardless of the name on the title.
Many states prevent the sale of vehicles that still list liens on the title of ownership. It would be wise to bring proof of a lien release with you to the notary's office., You can find a notary public at:


A local bank or credit union. Many financial institutions have a notary public who can notarize documents for a small fee.
Most UPS stores and pawn shops will have a notary available for a small fee, though it is always best to call ahead and verify availability.

Notary Rotary. Notary Rotary provides a database of notaries public searchable by zip code.

,, Remarkably, even among all the states that require the signature of a notary, there are again many differences. For example:


The state of Ohio requires that both buyer and seller sign in front of the notary, or at least inform the notary in person that they did sign the document.In North Carolina, only the signature of the seller must be notarized.Notaries in Montana can notarize open titles--that is, they can authorize the sale of a vehicle without a buyer ever being identified on any document., At the least, you will need the title, your state issued photo identification (“ID”), and the notary fee. ID must be issued by the state (such as a drivers license) or the military (such as a military ID card) and contain a photo.

, Use blue or black ink.


If you are the seller, sign your name exactly as it is listed on the title. For example, if the title uses your middle initial, you should sign using your middle initial as well.
If you are the buyer, sign your name exactly how you wish for it to appear on the title. For example, if you want to use your middle name, sign the title using your middle name.

, The Notary will sign and then stamp or seal the title, verifying that the signatures are those of the buyer and/or the seller.

, Notaries may charge a small fee for their services.


In Ohio, the fee to have both signatures notarized on a car title would be $4.In California, the maximum fee that can be charged by a notary in this circumstance is $10.

Also ensure that everyone else in the vehicle is wearing their seat belt. Even if you are wearing your seat belt, someone else who is not wearing their seat belt could be thrown into you in a collision and cause death or serious injury.;
, In a collision, the airbags will inflate. When airbags inflate, they shoot out so fast that anyone leaning against the dashboard could be thrown backwards and seriously injured or killed.

, (The front seat position for child seats is illegal in many places.) Regardless of legality, if possible, rear-facing child seats should always be fitted in the rear of the car.

, This is dangerous for the same reasons it is dangerous to lean against the dashboard.

, These are extremely dangerous if sent flying in a collision. If you have heavy objects, place them in the trunk or tie them down securely so that they cannot move if impacted.

, There may be further collisions.

, Switch off your engine first.

, The pileup may have involved a vehicle which is carrying dangerous goods. You may not be able to tell this just by looking at vehicles, so assume that it is unsafe to light up.

, If it is safe to do this, find ways to warn others; for example, using a warning triangle. This will reduce the likelihood of further collisions.

Get a good night’s sleep before departure.,
Eat a healthy, hydrating meal.,
Avoid heavy, rich foods.,
Take a driving buddy.,
Check your medications.",How to Stay Alert Driving at Night1," Studies have shown that getting quality rest before departure serves as a much better countermeasure to drowsy driving than any steps you can take while already on the road.Make sure you’re on a good sleep schedule before you’ll be night driving and, if possible, grab an additional nap before you get behind the wheel. This way you can stop the problem before it starts.;
, Eating a meal rich in whole grains, vegetables, and lean protein before you leave will help to get your trip off on the right track. Foods with lots of water in them are also good components, as hydration has been shown to help keep the body and brain awake.You can also pack some healthy snacks such as carrots, fruit, and nuts to take with you. These will provide natural doses of energy, and the act of chewing and the sensations on your tastebuds will also help combat drowsiness and tedium.
Though salty and sweet snacks such as chips and candy can be tempting, try to avoid them. The sugar high and salty satisfaction they offer are short-lived and can lead to an energy crash., There’s no reason you have to starve while driving at night, but be selective about the types of foods you consume while behind the wheel. Rich foods in large quantities such as fast food hamburgers or jumbo French fries present a shock to your body and require it to invest considerable energy into digesting it. This investment comes at the cost of the rest of your bodily and brain function, diverting energy it could be using to keep you alert into processing that heavy sandwich or milkshake.Some foods—for example, cheese, eggs, and turkey—also contain high doses of the soporific amino acid tryptophan, so be sure you know what’s in your food before you get behind the wheel!

, Sometimes you have no choice but to drive alone at night, but you should recruit a ride-along buddy whenever possible. Recruiting a passenger won’t just give you someone to help with directions: it will also give you someone with whom to chat, laugh, and make observations and thus provide invaluable assistance in staying alert and engaged.Your car-bound co-pilot can also monitor your driving and help you decide if you need to pull over to rest or switch drivers.

, Studies have shown that depressants—alcohol and other drugs which slow your heart rate and function—affect safe driving more than any other factor. You might think this is obvious, but you also might not be aware that the medication your doctor has prescribed predisposes you to drowsiness. To be safe, check the ingredients and counter indications of your meds before you try driving at night.You should ask your doctor to verify, but a good rule of thumb is that any blood pressure medications, benzodiazepines—for example, alprazolam, diazepam, and clonazepam—and antihistamines are likely to cause or exacerbate fatigue."
"
Consume caffeine in moderation.,
Listen to peppy music.,
Switch off the soothing music.,
Play a podcast or audiobook.,
Pull over and take a brisk walk.,
Roll down your windows.",How to Stay Alert Driving at Night2," While you don’t want to rely on caffeine in order to stay awake and alert while driving, there’s nothing wrong with the odd cuppa to perk up your senses. After all, studies have shown that caffeine sharpens your brain function and focus for several hours after consumption. Just make sure you don’t overdo it–coffee is a diuretic, meaning you might be pulling over for bathroom breaks more often than you like if you have too much!If coffee makes you jittery, try low-caffeine beverages such as soda or green tea.

, Music with an accelerated beat has been shown to have an energizing effect which can override symptoms of fatigue.It can also keep your mind occupied and stimulated, so consider putting your favorite CD or Pandora station on the next time you need to drive at night. Opt for old favorites to which you can sing along, as the act of singing makes your body release more endorphins.You don’t have to pump up the volume in order to pump up your energy. While loud music may help you get energized, it has been shown to affect driving performance adversely.Be sure not to fiddle with the song selection or volume while driving. Always wait until you are stopped in a safe place to make any adjustments to your playlist.

, Music can be a great way to stay alert and engaged, but you should consider the genre and beat of the music before switching it on. Slow ballads or soothing classical music can relax your body, lower your heart rate, and slow your breathing, effectively turning a potential stimulant into a soporific sonata.Similarly, avoid a podcast host or audiobook narrator whose voice strikes you as soft and calming. You can use them to relax during the day or fall asleep to at night, but putting them on in the car can be dangerously doze-inducing.

, If your mind wanders when you listen to music, try listening instead to a narrated audiobook, podcast, or radio news show. You might find that the narrative format requires you to follow along and stay more focused than music does. Pick a non-fiction subject or novel which you know you love and doesn’t take a long time to hook you in.For example, if you love to watch detective shows at home, buy an Agatha Christie audiobook or other suspenseful mystery. If you love history, download a podcast that discusses interesting historical topics, such as Stuff You Missed in History Class or The History Chicks.

, If you find yourself getting drowsy in spite of your favorite music blasting on the stereo and plenty of coffee, you might want to pull over to a rest area, gas station, or parking lot. Getting out of the car and taking a brisk walk will get your heart rate up, get your leg muscles moving, and boost brain function. This can be particularly helpful if it’s cold outside, as cold temperatures act as a jolt to the system, spiking energy and alertness.If you’re on a long road trip, take a walk every time you stop for gas or bathroom breaks along the way.

, Feeling chilly and even shivering a bit can make you uncomfortable. This general discomfort has been shown to help keep your senses alert and poised at the ready, so blow some chilled, rejuvenating air onto your face and neck next time you start to feel cozily drowsy behind the wheel.In addition to dousing yourself in some cool, night air, you can drink an ice cold beverage or sit on a cold compress.Just don’t count on these remedial measures having a long-term effect: they can help to refresh you, but they won’t solve your fatigue for hours at a time."

Don’t activate cruise control.,
Dim the dashboard lights.,
Don’t talk on the phone.",How to Stay Alert Driving at Night3," Cruise control is a convenient feature offered on many automatic transmission vehicles, but you should only use it in the day time when you’re not sleepy in the slightest. This automated feature creates what is called a reduced driver workload—that is, it allows you to pay less attention to the mechanisms and process of driving.This reduced workload can mean that your mind wanders more easily and does a worse job driving than it would under normal, non-automated conditions.

The adverse effects of cruise control appear most frequently in male drivers under the age of 40, so be especially vigilant if you belong to this demographic., Bright dashboard lights can cause unnecessary eye strain when driving at night, which in turn can make you tired more quickly.You can soften this glare by turning the dimmer switch—usually located near the headlight knob—down until the dashboard shine less brightly than outside traffic markers reflecting your headlights.

You can also adjust your outside mirrors so that they face downward in order to keep the direct glare of following vehicles’ headlights out of your eyes. It might seem counterintuitive, but it actually allows you to monitor overtaking vehicles from the reflection of their headlights on the pavement.
Also be sure to eliminate other light sources from within the vehicle. If your passenger must read or navigate, a flashlight or book light will be less distracting than the vehicle's dome light. All video screens should be in the back seat., It might seem like gabbing with a friend or catching up with a relative can be a good way to engage your mind and resist drowsiness. In fact, though, studies have shown that speaking on the phone—even if it’s a hands-free device—can interfere with driving performance. This is because you’re asking your brain to complete two tasks concurrently, and no one can do two things well at the same time."
"
Be aware of eye stress and yawning.,
Take a 15-20 minute nap if you notice drifting or other driving errors.,
Know when to quit.",How to Stay Alert Driving at Night4," Some of the most telling signs that you’re unfit to drive will manifest in your eyes and gestures. Switch up your alertness methods—for example, if you’re listening to audiobook, try switching to an amped-up CD or radio station—if you experience difficulty focusing, excessive blinking, or yawning. These symptoms indicate unsafe levels of fatigue and could lead to more serious issues more quickly than you realize.Detecting these early signs of exhaustion is particularly important because the next step of fatigue—characterized by memory lapses, disorientation, and slowed reactions—is already a dangerous state of impairment which causes thousands of traffic accidents every year., If you catch yourself drifting into the median or shoulder, slamming on the brakes due to a delayed reaction, or missing a stop sign, you are already experiencing dangerous symptoms of over-tired driving. You may not have taken any drugs or alcohol, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t impaired. You should pull over immediately and try to take a cat nap to refresh your energy.If you still feel extremely sleepy after your cat nap, don’t try to force it and continue on the road. Quit while you’re ahead and get a good night’s sleep before resuming your drive.

, There are times when even the utmost vigilance, quantities of caffeine, and other alertness tricks simply won't work. If you feel sleepy and strained in spite of all your attempts to perk yourself up, you need to throw in the towel and sleep. Find a hotel, motel, or rest area where you can sleep for a few hours before continuing your drive.If you’re going to stop somewhere, be sure to call a friend or family member to let them know exactly where you are and how long you plan to sleep. That way someone knows where you are and you won’t alarm anyone expecting your arrival.

Avoid the situation.,
Don't look at the accident -- look at the escape route.,
Get the information.,
Use car safety equipment.,
Place objects in a safe place.",How to Prepare for a Car Accident," You don't have to know any of this if you are a good and safe driver. However, if you are a driver who gets your car, yourself, your passengers, or others in a dangerous situation where an accident is possible, don't feel too guilty. Even the best drivers have an accident now and then.;
, Studies have proven that we drive where we are looking. If someone pulls out in front of you, look beyond that car. You will instinctively steer and head towards that point.

, What's happening? Why are you in danger? Where are you? Ask either the driver or another passenger, or if you already know, make sure you keep the information handy within your brain.

, These are your seat belts and air bags. Before you even buy a car, you should know where the air bags are. Older cars usually have air bags in the front seats, while newer models have air bags in every spot of the car. Always put your seat belt on. If you are part of a family that does not practice regular seat belt use, consider these facts:


You will not have time to put your seat belts on as a dangerous situation develops
The law requires you and your children to wear seat belts
If you are in an accident, your monetary recovery will be less because of your own negligence. Whatever your reasons are for not a safety restraint (too uncomfortable, not fashionable, unneeded), using them is always better than suffering injury or death, or to have your passenger injured or dead.

, If you have books in your car, place them on the floor. If you put them on a seat, they could fly up or forward in an accident, hitting and potentially injuring someone. Small objects such as small car games for kids or craft objects (stamps, glue sticks, etc.) should be placed under the front seat. This will prevent them from flying up and hitting someone. Heavy items in the boot (trunk) should be tethered or tied down, particularly if you have folding rear seats. A 70kg load will move forward with a force of nearly 2000N in a 30 mph (48 km/h) collision - easily enough to come through a rear seat.

Pay attention and obey road signs, such as STOP signs; come to a complete stop, and look both ways, before advancing.,
Slow down, below normal speed, while driving on winding roads... meaning lots of curves in the road.

,
Pull over to the shoulder of the road: If your car is driving harshly over the roads, and is even causing a problem with your power steering, then the first thing to look into is your tires.",How to Stay Safe on the Highway,";
,,, Stay at a safe speed to allow you time to stop.

, Do not drive with a cellphone stuck to your ear. Pull over if you plan or need to talk on the phone.

, Don't have it blaring because if an ambulance, fire truck or a police car are needing to get by, you need to be able to hear their sirens. Otherwise you could end up in a wreck and riding in an ambulance.

, It is also a good idea to carry a warning triangle (in some European countries this is required by law).

, Keep an eye out for the people that may not obey road signs. Also watch out for motorcycles.

,, It is possible to have substantial damage to the tread without it being visible from the side as a flat would be.

Drive cautiously and safely.",How to Prevent Whiplash in a Car Accident," Research the rear end crash ratings of different cars. Cars that have superior crash ratings are better able to prevent whiplash if you are ever involved in a car accident.;
, The headrest should sit directly behind your head while you are driving. Proper headrest position will prevent your head from being jerked in an unnatural position and reduce strain from being tossed back and forth. A properly adjusted headrest will be as close as possible to the back of your head as you can comfortably stand. The headrest should reach the top of your ears.

, Consistent seat belt use can help prevent you from suffering from whiplash if you are in a car accident. Seat belts help keep you safe upon impact by reducing jarring and strain and can keep you from becoming a flying projectile if your car is ever hit.

, Defensive driving can lower the chances of you becoming a car crash victim. According to statistics there are over 125,000 whiplash injuries per year from car accidents.

Turn your windshield wipers on.,
Change old or brittle wiper inserts.,
Replace windshield wiper blades as needed.",How to Increase Driving Visibility in Rain1," Windshield wipers typically have three different settings: slow, medium, and fast. If the rain is light, select the slow speed. If the rain is heavier (and your visibility is poorer), select a faster speed.If you have a rear windshield wiper, activate it, too.;
, The windshield wiper consists of two parts: the rubber wiper insert that swipes across the windshield and the metal blade that actually holds it. Check your wiper inserts regularly for stiffness or cracks, and replace them if you detect any.Most windshield wiper inserts will need to be changed at least once every three years to improve visibility in rain.Consult your owner’s manual or an auto parts store for information regarding the type and size of wiper blades you need.
Generally, wiper inserts can simply be slid into and out of the metal blade itself.
If you regularly park your car outside, you’ll probably have to replace your windshield wipers more often than if you park in the garage.

, If your wiper blades are rusty, bent, or corroded, replace them, too. Use high-quality wiper blades, preferably ones coated with a rain repellent.If there are areas of your windshield that do not get properly wiped when you use your wipers, you’ll know that the wiper is bent or applying uneven pressure to the windshield.
Generally, wiper blades can simply be unsnapped from the metal arm that holds the blade, then a new blade can be snapped in.
Consult your owner’s manual or your local auto parts store for information regarding the sort of wiper blades you need.

Turn on your headlights.,
Wash your headlights.,
Scrub your headlights with sandpaper.",How to Increase Driving Visibility in Rain2," If you’re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you’re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you., If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car., For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter’s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work.Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet/dry sandpaper.

Don’t follow trucks or buses closely.,
Put on some polarized glasses.,
Turn on the demisters if necessary.,
Slow down.,

Apply a coat of rain repellent to your windshield.",How to Increase Driving Visibility in Rain3," The spray produced by these large vehicles will decrease your visibility in rain. Try to keep several car lengths away from trucks and buses.If you need to pass trucks or buses, do so quickly so as to minimize the time you spend behind or beside them, where you can experience significant spray.

, If you’re driving through rain during the day, put on a pair of polarized sunglasses to increase your driving visibility. If you’re driving in rain at night, you will not be able to increase driving visibility by wearing polarized sunglasses., If the temperature of the rain and the temperature inside your vehicle are too different, your windows might fog over. To combat this and increase visibility when driving in the rain, turn on the demisters., Slowing your speed can give you extra time to see what’s ahead. You should be able to see the space you’ll be driving through at least 12 seconds before you pass through it. When driving in the rain, adjust your speed to meet this visibility standard., Sometimes your windshield wipers are not strong enough to wipe away all the grime on your windshield. Dirt stuck to the top corners, especially, could dribble down during a rainstorm. To increase driving visibility when you encounter rain, wash your windshield regularly (or visit the car wash to have the windshield cleaned professionally)., Rain repellents will prevent rain from beading on your windshield. Instead, rain will roll smoothly off the windshield upon contact. Specific directions for use vary depending on the product you use. Generally, though, you can simply spray the repellent of your choice on the windshield, then wipe it away using a gentle circular motion.Rain repellent solutions usually need to be applied once every six months.

Go out with fun people.,
Choose a location you like.,
Drink along with everyone else.,
Find a friend who doesn't drink.,
Talk to people.,
Call it night when it's clear to you that the partying needs to finish for your friends.,
Take your own car or at least have the keys to a car that you've been given absolute, clear permission to drive.",How to Have Fun Being a Designated Driver," Choose people who are joyous, not malevolent in intent. Aim to have a pleasant, fun evening, and be ready to watch your other friends make you laugh once they are drunk.;
, Most people will be drunk, they won't realize where they are, so why not go somewhere that you like because you'll be the only one seeing and enjoying it for what it is. Call it the trade-off for being the designated driver.

, Don't assume that not being able to have alcohol means not being able to have delicious drinks. Try virgin versions of the alcoholic drinks, mocktails and interesting smoothies or shakes. You can try different flavored waters and iced teas. If you're the type to like hot drinks, have coffees, teas or hot chocolates to warm the cockles of your heart.

, Perhaps this friend never drinks or perhaps he or she is also a designated driver for the same occasion. This can be a great person to team up with and observe the general deterioration in manners and communication as the evening wears on. You'll both be a source of mutual support for the non-drinking approach to the event and won't feel so left out.


Turn this into a people-watching occasion. Look for the funniest things happening or try to guess what people are thinking, doing or relating to each other, all from a distance.
Have fun watching the crazy, funny things your friends do. For example, telling tall tales or dancing eccentrically. Don't forget to capture the highlights of the evening on camera, reminding them of their last night's antics. This will be the best part of the evening, and you'll be able to laugh about it, even several weeks later.
Do not go posting the photos online; that's a big lack of manners and respect for your friends. Simply share them among yourselves.
Do not poke fun at your friends or make them feel bad. Know when to tell them it's time to stop and think about going home.

, You will likely find that drunk people are rather unguarded in what they say and a lot of things get said that wouldn't be said normally. Scout's honor when you hear it all but it is an interesting way to stay engaged in what's happening at the party without feeling left out.


Be the agony aunt or uncle. When the mood gets somber and the tears start falling, and the sob stories begin, be there for your friends. While it may not seem like ""fun"", there is an element of enjoyment in being able to help friends, to hold their hands and hug them better. Listen to them and tell them that everything is going to be okay.

, Enjoy the role of helping out, which should also include being alert to telling a friend when he or she has had enough and that it's time to go home. Being strong for your friends is part of being a designated driver and it's a role that earns respect.

, When it's time to go home, count your friends: forgetting one would be a shame! Make sure your friends are not about to throw up. If they seem likely to do so, either wait it out for awhile or push them to do so before getting in the car.


Keep the windows open to give them fresh air and ventilate your car to get rid of the stench of alcohol.
Drive slowly and smoothly in order not to stir up your friends' fragile stomachs.
Perhaps bring a bucket or some sick bags, just in case.

Look at traffic signals and lane markings to ensure passing is legal.,
Evaluate the conditions.,
Check surrounding traffic.,
Ensure you can pass without going over the speed limit.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Pass Safely on a Two Lane Road1," Check for signs indicating whether you’re in a designated passing zone or non-passing zone. If you’re unsure, look at the lane markers.A solid yellow line indicates it’s unsafe to pass into oncoming traffic.
A single dotted yellow line or a solid yellow line with a dotted line on your side of traffic indicates that it’s a safe move.;
, Look around you, and check to be sure that there are no conditions that could prohibit you from making a safe pass. Be aware of upcoming hills or curves, traffic stop signs or lights, and train tracks.Tunnels, bridges and viaducts can obstruct your view. If you see any up ahead, wait until you have passed them to consider a move.
Do not attempt to pass a slow moving car if you’re driving on a hill or curve. Wait for a long stretch of flat road.
Be aware of driveways and other entrances where cars may unexpectedly come from.
If the weather is rainy, foggy or snowy, consider staying in your lane as these types of conditions can cause you to slip or they can make it more challenging to see ahead.
Check your surroundings for animals, like deer, that can run into the middle of the road.

, Look ahead to the other lane, and notice traffic following behind you, and check for vehicles in front of the one you plan to pass.Establish there is no oncoming traffic that will come within 200 feet (0.061 km) of you in the passing lane. Do not pass if you can’t see .25 miles (0.40 km) ahead.
Look at your rear-view and side mirrors for traffic coming from behind you right before you move into the opposite lane to pass. Then check for oncoming traffic once again.

, It can be frustrating to be behind someone driving slow, but if they are driving less than 15 miles (24 km) under the speed limit, it may be best to stay put.You’ll have to increase your speed up to 20 miles (32 km) to pass, so be sure you’re aware of the speed limit where you are.
Be aware that speed limits can drop dramatically, up to 30 miles (48 km), along some country roads upon arriving in a town.

, Ensure that you have enough space between the vehicle in front of you and any behind you so that you have an opening if you need get back into your lane without passing.


Use the two-second rule. Count one thousand one, one thousand two after the car in front of you has passed a marker of some kind to be sure you have enough space. A sign, tree or lamppost works as a marker.

Don’t drive if you know you are sleepy.,
If you feel drowsy while you are driving, pull off the road and get some sleep.

,
Understand that if you are drowsy, even if you manage to stay awake, your reaction time and your judgment is impaired.

,
If you think that you are AT RISK of becoming drowsy, attach the CDFF to your bare shin and turn it on.,
This device has only been tested for an eight hour period.,
If used as recommended, the CDFF will keep you from falling asleep at the wheel, make you more alert while driving, and allow you to get safely home or to the next rest stop where you can stop and get sleep.

",How to Keep Awake While Driving Using a Cold Diffusion Fatigue Fighter,";
,,, The CDFF has a programmed cycle that uses temperature variations to prevent your body from establishing the core body temperature required for sleep. You simply won't fall asleep while using the device. There is also a documented 25% to 40% alertness increase in fatigued individuals.

, It is not intended to allow you to stay awake forever. Always remember that is it dangerous to go without sleep for long periods of time.

Quickly pass the vehicle.,
Signal your re-entry to the appropriate lane.",How to Pass Safely on a Two Lane Road2," Give yourself at least one vehicle length distance between the front end of your car and the back end of the one you’re passing.


Avoid being aggressive with your speed and give yourself plenty of time and space between the vehicle. Don’t slam on the gas to safely arrive in front of the slow car.

, Alert the slow driver of your maneuver by using your turn signal. Check your mirrors as you start to make a pass.

, Look ahead to be sure there is still no traffic coming up ahead. If it’s safe, swiftly accelerate to a speed that does not exceed the speed limit. You should be able to make the maneuver in roughly 15 seconds.

, Glance at both your side and rear-view mirrors to determine the position of the vehicle you just passed.


Always keep an eye on the vehicle you’re passing to be sure they don’t speed up or move in an unexpected way.
Keep both hands on the wheel the whole time.
Be on alert.

, Put on your turn signal after moving about two car lengths in front of the vehicle you are passing.


Smoothly cross back into the lane.
Maintain your desired speed without exceeding the limit.
Glance in your rear-view to check the distance of yourself and the car you passed.

Think of any hypothetical situation you may encounter, e.g flat tire, high-speed under-/over steer, pursuit driving, etc.,
Handbrake turning is not only for showing off.,
Practice emergency stopping.,
Identify each dangerous situation when you drive and remember it.,

",How to Improve Your Driving Skills," This way you'll be working on driving as a whole, not on driving a specific car.;
, A disused airfield is the best idea, because it has long straight stretches (the runway), corners (turn way to runway entrance) and wide open spaces (the area in front of the hangars). If you are not so lucky as to have a disused airfield nearby, you may look for these three things separately. You may use abandoned country roads and disused parking lots that measure at least 50 by 50 feet.

, This includes lateral stability, acceleration, braking distance, etc. When you learn how to feel the vehicle, you'll be able to drive anything at its verge.

, Think what you must do in that particular case, then get in the car and do it. Make a note of your weak points and work to improve them.

, It's the best way to correct high-speed under steer. It's also useful on icy roads. It gives you confidence on rough road.

, If your car has ABS, disable it when you practice.

, Then, when you have the time, think of what you could've done better and practice the preventive measures and maneuvers.

, Once you get the knack of it, it's one of the most useful skills a driver can have.

, Do it in a wide empty lot, not on the road.

Listen for noises when you turn the steering wheel.,
Notice how freely the steering wheel turns.,
Check for power steering fluid leaks.",How to Handle Power Steering Failure1," If you hear a whining, moaning or shrieking sound, your power steering system pump could be seriously low on fluid.






;
, Normally, you should be able to turn the steering wheel with little effort whenever you want to steer the car into a curve or around a corner. If you find it a major effort to turn the steering wheel to turn the car, your power steering system is going out.








, If you notice a stain on the ground under your car when it sits for a long period, fluid may be leaking from your car. If the stain appears amber, pink or red, it may be power steering fluid.









If you have trouble figuring out what color the stain is, place a sheet of white butcher paper under your car when you leave it parked for several hours. The color will be easier to see against a white background.

Warn other drivers.,
Move toward the side of the road.,
Bring the car to a gradual stop, slowing the car gradually.,
Restart the engine if it stalled.",How to Handle Power Steering Failure2," If your power steering fails while you are moving at high speed, your first instinct will be to panic. Instead, turn on your flashers and honk your horn to let other drivers know you are having sudden car problems. This will cause them to get out of your way.








, Do this as carefully as you can; without power, it will be much harder to steer your car.








, Slamming the brakes may throw the car into a skid that would be difficult to steer out of with power steering and almost impossible to steer out of without it.









If your car's power steering goes out because of the engine stalling, your brakes will feel stiffer if you have power brakes, forcing you to hit the pedal harder and depress it lower than normal. You may also have to downshift to a lower gear or use the friction of a guardrail, gravel shoulder or cement divider to slow the car enough for the brakes to do the rest.

, Turn the steering wheel in either direction to see how well it turns. If it turns as freely as usual, pull back onto the roadway and continue driving as normal. If it doesn't, either drive slowly to the nearest mechanic or call for a tow truck.

Remain calm and don’t allow your emotions to get the better of you.,
Pull over and allow the vehicle to pass.,
Keep to the right.,
Slow down on the straight sections of road.,
Maintain a constant speed.,
Do not force yourself to travel faster than you feel safe doing.,
Follow a truck.,
Avoid tapping on the brake pedal.",How to Handle Tailgaters on the Road1," If you notice someone tailgating you, your first instinct might be to panic or get upset. You might either feel nervous that someone is following too closely, or you might be angry that someone is following too closely. Either way you need to take a couple of deep breaths and put your emotions aside for the time being.Remaining calm also ensures you’re able to stay in control of your vehicle and avoid causing an accident.
Turn the radio down or off if it helps you to concentrate and calm down.
Pay extra attention to your driving until you’ve been able to remove yourself from the situation.;
, The easiest thing to do if you have someone tailgating you is to pull over and let that person pass you. If it’s safe, just pull to the side of the road and allow whomever was following you to pass. Get back onto the road when you feel it safe to do so.Always remember to signal your intention of pulling over in advance of actually pulling over. Keep your signal on while you’re pulled over, until you’re ready to merge back into traffic.
If the area allows, you can also pull into a parking lot and remain there until the tailgater has passed.
Do not attempt this on a major, multi-lane highway as it may be difficult to merge back into traffic later or the shoulder may not be wide enough.

, When driving on a multi-lane road, always keep to the right-most lane unless you are passing someone. Leaving the other lanes available for other drivers to pass you will help ensure you do not get a tailgater in the first place.This is especially important in areas where the passing lane is not constant. When a passing lane appears, keep to the right unless you need to pass the person in front of you. In these situations the passing lane may only be available for a few kilometres.

, When travelling on a road that is winding and curving significantly, and only has 1 lane in either direction, chances are there will not be a lot of places for someone to pass you safely. When you reach a straight piece of road and passing is allowed, slow down. Give your tailgater a chance to pass you and get ahead of you before the next winding section.If it helps, you can even move over slightly to signal to the car behind you that they’re welcome to pass.
If another driver attempts to pass you on an unsafe part of the road, slow down. If they get into trouble, they may instinctively swerve back into your lane and hit you.

, Tailgaters may be stuck behind you because your speed is inconsistent and they may not feel it’s safe to pass you. Keep your speed as constant as possible so the tailgater has a chance to judge if it’s safe to pass you.If your car is equipped with cruise control, this is a great time to take advantage of it.
Don’t purposely change your speed just to annoy the person who is tailgating you. This may only end up inflaming the situation and causing an accident.

, When being tailgated another instinct may be to speed up so the gap between you and the car behind you widens. This is usually only a temporary fix, as the car behind you is also likely to speed up, thereby closing the gap again. The problem is, you’re now travelling at a faster speed and you still have a tailgater.Don’t speed up to appease a tailgater. Keep to a speed you feel comfortable with based on the road conditions.

, When in doubt, follow a truck! If you find yourself constantly being tailgated, maybe because you are driving a little slower than other drivers on the road, try getting behind a truck (at a safe distance of course).Chances are the truck is travelling at a speed you’re comfortable with, so you don’t have to pass the truck.
The truck is also big enough for other drivers to see it from a distance. When they see a truck ahead, they’ll likely prepare themselves to pass it.
If you’re following the truck, they’ll pass you as well before they’re able to tailgate you.

, While it may seem logical to tap on the brake pedal so your brakes light up in an attempt to “ask” the tailgater to back off, it’s unlikely to work. Plus, one of two things might end up happening:One, the driver behind you may not have been paying attention and may panic when they see your brake lights. They may then slam on their own brakes and cause a chain reaction behind them, resulting in an accident.
Two, the driver may catch onto what you’re doing and start to ignore your brake lights. If you need to brake for real at some point, the driver behind you may not react at all.

Use slow traffic pull-outs.,
Watch your speed on the straight-aways.,
Do not drive in the fast lane.,
Avoid pacing the car beside you.,
Respond courteously to someone flashing their headlights at you.,
Signal your intentions well in advance.",How to Handle Tailgaters on the Road2," Some roads that are winding or on steep hillsides will have traffic pull-out spots where slow drivers can get off the road and allow other drivers to pass them. These pull-outs are usually in areas where there is not enough room for an actual passing lane. Use the pull-out if you have a tailgater or if you’re not able to keep up with the flow of traffic.Even if you’re driving the speed limit, you may still be driving slower than other cars on the road. Use the pull-out to be polite to other drivers and allow them to get around you and continue on to their destination unimpeded.

, Many drivers go slow because the road conditions call for it. Maybe the road is icy or wet, or really curvy, so you’ve slowed down. When the road straightens out, or becomes dry, don’t speed up if there is a car tailgating you. Speeding up on the straightaways and not allowing the tailgater to pass will likely make them mad., The fast lane is for passing. If you are not passing anyone, do not drive in the fast lane. People who are driving faster than you can come up behind quite quickly, especially if you aren’t paying attention to your rearview mirror.If a car comes up on your suddenly while you’re in the fast lane, don’t immediately pull into the middle or curb lane without first checking that the other driver isn’t also going to do this. Because they’ve encountered someone in their own lane, they may decide to pass you on the right.

, If you’re on a multi-lane road, regardless of which lane you’re in, you should avoid pacing the car in the other lane. This is especially important if you’re in the fast lane, as you should be overtaking the other car, not travelling at the same speed as them. However, if you’re in the slow lane and you have a tailgater, the fact that the car already in the fast lane is pacing you may be the reason your tailgater can’t get around you., In some situations a car that is tailgating you might flash their headlights. Normally this means they’re trying to pass you, but for whatever reason, you’re making it difficult. Pay attention to these flashes and move out of the way — don’t get upset., If you have a tailgater, make sure to signal your intentions to turn or slow down well in advance. Because of the lack of space behind you, that driver may need some extra time to adjust their speed when you turn or slow down.While it would technically be the fault of the driver behind you, if you got into an accident, it’s still your car that’s been hit and damaged.

Be prepared to react if you hydroplane.,
Know what to do if you start to skid.",How to Drive Safely in the Rain," Being able to see properly is key to driving safely any time, especially when visibility is already reduced because of rain. To improve your visibility:Clean the inside and outside of the windows regularly to remove dirt, dust, mud, smoke, fingerprints, grime, and other materials.
If your windows fog up, turn on the air conditioning or cold air in the car and aim the vents at the windows. Turn on the rear defroster, and open the windows if necessary to increase the airflow.;
, Take your car to a mechanic to have your headlights adjusted properly if you’ve never done this. This will ensure your headlights are pointing in the right direction, make it easier to see, and prevent you from blinding other drivers.Check regularly to make sure none of your lights have burnt out, and replace dead lights immediately. This includes headlights, brake lights, turn signals, tail lights, and running lights.
Keep the light covers on your car clean so that dust and dirt don’t reduce their efficacy.

, Tire tread is what allows your tires to adhere to the road, which is why it’s so dangerous to drive with bald tires. Without the right traction, you can skid, slide, and hydroplane easily in wet conditions.


New tires generally have about 10/32 of an inch of tread. Tires should be replaced when the tread gets to 4/32 of an inch. Tires with 2/32 of an inch or less of tread are unsafe and shouldn’t be used., Along with keeping your windshield clean, you can also improve your visibility in wet conditions by ensuring that your wipers are up to the job, and by using the right washer fluid.Replace your wipers every year to prevent them from cracking, breaking, or not sealing properly when you need them most.
Try a hydrophobic washer fluid that will cause water to bead up and drip off your windshield, rather than sticking to it and blocking your view.

, During any inclement weather or unfavorable driving conditions, your first reaction should always be to adjust your speed accordingly. Wet roads reduce your traction, and slowing down reduces the chances of you skidding out, and will give you more time to react to emergencies.


Wet roads can reduce your traction by about a third, so you should also reduce your speed by a third.Even small amounts of water can make the road more slippery, because the water mixes with oils on the road, and this creates a greasy layer.
Driving too quickly on wet roads can lead to hydroplaning, which means that your tires lose contact with the road. When a car hydroplanes, you have very little control in terms of steering or braking.

, When you're behind the wheel, it’s important to always pay attention to the road, other cars, and pedestrians. This is especially true in the rain, when you cannot see as well, and your ability to stop may be hindered by the slickness of the road. Stay focused by:Keeping your eyes on the road at all times
Paying attention to what drivers and pedestrians are doing around you.
Turning off the radio, and ignoring your cell phone and other electronic devices.
Ceasing any conversations you were having with passengers.
Not eating, reading, or putting on makeup while driving.

, When it starts to rain, turn on your headlights immediately, regardless of whether it’s day or night. In some states, it’s actually illegal to drive without headlights when it’s raining. There are two reasons why you should drive with your lights on in the rain:


First of all, your headlights will make it easier for other drivers to see your car.
Second, rain typically means cloudy skies, and turning your lights on will help you see the road better., You should always drive with your hands at 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock on the steering wheel, because this gives you maximum control if you have to turn, swerve, or react quickly. It’s especially important to have both hands on the wheel when driving conditions are subpar.


While traditional wisdom said to drive with your hands at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock on the steering wheel, this increases the chances of injury from airbags in case of a collision., You should always leave a three- to four-second gap between your car and the car in front of you, and you should increase this to at least five seconds when it’s raining.Not only does this give you more time to stop or adjust if necessary, but it also prevents reduced visibility caused by the spray from other cars.


To determine how many seconds you are behind another car, make note of when that car passes a landmark (like a street sign) and then count how many seconds it takes before your car passes that same landmark.
Leaving space includes leaving an opening where you can escape quickly if necessary. To do this, make sure you always leave at least one open space beside or in front of you that you can move into.

, Slamming on the brakes can cause you to slide forward, and you won’t be able to control the car. Hitting the brakes too hard can also force water into your brakes, making them less effective.Instead of braking, you can also slow yourself down by easing off the accelerator, and downshifting if you have a manual transmission.
Not being able to stop as quickly in the rain is another reason why it’s so important to leave extra space between your car and the one in front of you.

, Turning too quickly on a wet road can cause your tires to hydroplane, and this means you won’t be able to control the car, and could skid out. Whenever you have a turn coming up, signal early and start slowing down sooner than you would in good conditions.Just like with driving, you should reduce the speed of your turns by about a third when it’s raining.

, Cruise control is another factor that can lead to hydroplaning. The weight of the car shifts slightly when you ease on or off the accelerator, and this helps the tires maintain traction with the road. But with cruise control, because the speed of the car is constant, there is no weight shift, and the car can lose traction., Never be afraid to pull over to the side of the road if you don’t feel comfortable driving. If you can't see the sides of the road, the cars in front of you, or your surroundings at a safe distance, pull over.Other things that can reduce your visibility include the glare from other car lights and lightning.
You may also need to pull over if there's too much water on the road, the road is too slick, or you simply don’t feel safe.
To pull over safely, turn on your signal, check your mirror and blind spots, pull over as far as possible to the side of the road, and turn on your four-way lights.

, Driving through deep or moving water can be hazardous for a number of reasons, including that you could get stuck, stall out, damage the car or the electrical components, or be swept away.Moving water is too deep if you cannot see the ground.
Don’t proceed through deep water if it comes higher than the bottom of your door.
If you encounter these types of road flooding, turn around and find another route. In a case where the only route is blocked, pull over and wait out the flooding.

, Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 35 miles (56 km) per hour, and when it happens your car may not react when you turn the steering wheel, and your back end may feel loose. In the event that your car does hydroplane:Stay calm
Avoid turning the steering wheel
Ease your foot off the accelerator
Apply slow and gentle pressure to the brakes

, Skidding on a wet road can be particularly frightening, but like any emergency situation, the key is remaining calm. Then, look where you want to go, ease your foot off the accelerator, and gently steer in the direction you want to travel. Avoid braking, and never slam on the brakes.To prevent skidding, always brake before entering a turn or curve, then let your foot off the brake before the turn."

Be careful not to shift the transmission into park or reverse.,
Turn the engine off only if all else fails.,

Look for the closest safe place to pull over.,
Bring the car to a complete stop and turn off the engine.,
Press and hold the ignition button for three seconds (if equipped).,
Do not drive the vehicle until it has been repaired.",How to Handle a Stuck Accelerator Pedal," If you find yourself in a situation where your accelerator pedal is stuck, your first reaction may be to panic. Panic can be dangerous to you and the other drivers on the road, so it’s important that you take a dep breath and stay calm.Take deep, controlled breaths to help slow your heart rate.
If possible, breath in through your nose and out through your mouth until you feel in control.;
, When driving, you usually should maintain a general level of awareness of everything going on around you, but it becomes extremely important if you find yourself with a stuck open throttle. You will need to find a way to get your vehicle off the road without putting yourself or others at any additional risk. This means quickly looking all around you to ensure you are aware of everything going on in your environment.Use your mirrors to identify other cars around so you can find the shortest route to the breakdown lane without risking an accident.
Look for pedestrians on the side of the road or in upcoming crosswalks.
Consider the type of road you are on. Are there breakdown lanes? Are there guard rails that may prevent you from pulling over right away?

, The issue with your accelerator may be with the pedal assembly. If this is the case, sliding your toe beneath the pedal and lifting it upward may bring your vehicle back to an idle and allow you to safely pull over. Keep your eyes on the road and both hands on the wheel as you attempt to lift the pedal with your right foot.Do not attempt to use your left foot, as you may need to transition to braking quickly. You will be able to do so with your right foot faster if your left hasn’t gotten in the way.
If the pedal comes up freely without affecting the RPMs of the vehicle, the gas pedal assembly is not the issue.

, If you are going slowly enough, you may be able to overcome the acceleration caused by your open throttle by firmly pressing down on the brake with your right foot. Be careful, your vehicle may respond differently than it normally does under braking as a result of the engine attempting to power the wheels forward.At high speeds, simply pressing the brake likely won’t bring the vehicle to a complete stop.
Be aware that some vehicles may pull to the left of right under hard braking. Keep both hands on the wheel as you attempt to stop a slow moving vehicle by applying the brake.

, The emergency or parking brake was not actually designed to stop a vehicle in motion, but rather to keep a vehicle from moving once it is stopped. As a result, the brake may fail if you attempt to engage it while moving, and the vehicle is likely to move erratically if you engage it.The emergency brake should only be used to stop a vehicle in an emergency that includes total brake failure.
Using the emergency brake can cause you to lose control of the vehicle.

, If your vehicle came equipped with a standard transmission, you can easily disengage the driveline of the vehicle from the wheels by pressing down on the clutch with your left foot. The engine is likely to begin revving (increasing its RPMs), so be prepared for it to make quite a bit of noise.With the clutch pedal pressed to the floor, the engine will no longer be powering the wheels.
Be sure to look behind you before slowing down dramatically to avoid being struck by an approaching vehicle.

, In a vehicle with a standard transmission, shifting in neutral involves pulling the vehicle’s shift lever out of gear while pressing down on the clutch. For automatic vehicles, you will simply need to push forward on the shift lever (or up if the lever is on your console) to take the vehicle out of drive and put it into neutral. You can usually identify neutral by looking for the letter “N” next to your shift lever.Neutral is almost always the gear directly above drive in automatic vehicles.
You should not have to push the button on the shift lever to shift from drive to neutral.

, If your vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission, all of the gears are in a line. When shifting the vehicle into neutral, be extremely careful not to push the shifter further than you intended. Accidentally shifting into reverse or park could cause significant damage to your transmission and even cause you to lose control of the vehicle.Most newer vehicles will only allow you to shift the vehicle from drive to neutral while moving.

, While turning the engine off will stop the vehicle from continuing to accelerate, it can also compromise your ability to steer and apply the brakes. Your power steering is powered by a pulley on your engine and it receives power only when the engine is running. Likewise, in some older vehicles the engine must be running in order to produce vacuum pressure for the brake system to function properly.If you cannot get the vehicle into neutral, you may need to turn off the engine to stop accelerating, but it should be seen as a last resort.
If you turn off the engine, be prepared for your steering to become extremely difficult.

, Your hazard flashers are a great way to let the drivers around you know that you are having an issue and that they should keep clear of your vehicle. Turn them on by pressing the appropriate button on your dashboard. In most vehicles, your hazard flashers should be marked with an exclamation point (!) in a triangle.You should make sure you know where the hazard flashers button is in your vehicle before encountering an emergency so you don’t have to look for it.
If you are unsure where to find yours, look it up in your owner’s manual at some point when you are not driving the vehicle.

, Once you have shifted the vehicle in neutral, you will have only the carried over speed from before disengaging the engine to get you to a safe place to stop, so you should do so as quickly and safely as possible. In many situations, simply pulling over to the side of the road will do.If possible, look for a place you can leave the car for a little while, as it will be unfit to drive until it has been repaired.
Breakdown lanes, rest stops and parking lots are all better alternatives to the side of the road when available.

, Apply the brake with your right foot until the vehicle comes to a complete stop just as you normally would. The disengaged engine is likely spinning a high number of RPMs (Revolutions per Minute) as a result of the stuck accelerator. Turn it off as soon as you’ve come to a complete stop to avoid causing further damage to the engine.Holding an engine at “redline” for an extended period of time can cause significant damage to the vehicle. Redline can be identified by the range of RPMs indicated on your tachometer with a red bar.
Your vehicle may have come equipped with an RPM governor that will prevent the engine from being over-revved. If the vehicle’s RPMs are surging and dropping repeatedly, it is likely because of the governor.

, In newer model vehicles equipped with a start/stop ignition button, it may not shut off immediately upon pressing the button. The vehicle’s on board computer may think you are still driving because of the gas pedal being engaged. In these vehicles, holding the start/stop ignition button for three seconds should shut down the motor.Vehicles equipped with start/stop ignition buttons are designed to prevent you from accidentally shutting off the vehicle while driving.
Holding the button down for three full seconds sends a message to the computer that you want it to override that safety feature.

, Once you are safely pulled over and the vehicle is shut off, do not start it again or attempt to drive. The vehicle will need to be towed to a repair facility and repaired before it will be safe to drive again.If law enforcement arrives and asks you to move the vehicle, explain the issue you had to them and they can help get a tow truck to you quickly.
Remember that it is illegal in many places to leave an unattended vehicle on the side of public road, particularly if it is in an unsafe place.

Identify vehicles that appear unsafe, such as those that are erratically merging across lanes, speeding dangerously, or drifting within a lane.
Follow the flow of traffic.
Signal before making a turn or merging into a lane.
Allow plenty of space between you and other vehicles/structures.
Never drive while tired or emotionally agitated., In many cases, even leaving fifteen minutes before the start or after the end of rush hour can dramatically decrease the flow of traffic on your drive. Though the worst times for traffic (rush hour) will vary according to city, generally you can expect it to be heaviest between 8 and 9 AM, and 5 and 6 PM., When you are approaching a crowded section of road, you should take your foot of the accelerator and coast forward, allowing friction to slow your vehicle. This will moderate your speed while saving you gas.


Depending on your distance, you may also need to use your brake to slow to an acceptable speed when approaching heavy traffic.
By slowing your speed, there is a chance that the heavy traffic will break up before you reach it. This constant, slower speed will save you gas and create less potential for accidents., Even in automatic cars, where you don’t normally have to shift out of drive except to park or move in reverse, there are sometimes lower gear settings. These are usually noted on your gearshift by the letter “D” followed by a number, like D2 or D3.


D3 or 3 is normally used for stop and go driving.
D2, 2, or S (which stands for ‘slow’) locks your car into second gear, which can be useful if you are driving up or down a steep hill.
Lower gears will also brake more quickly due to naturally occurring ""engine braking."", You should gauge how many seconds of distance is between you and the next car ahead. Do this by picking a feature, like a road sign, and counting slowly up from “one” as the car in front passes the sign.


When your car is even with the sign stop counting. The number you have stopped counting on represents how many seconds of distance is between you and the car in front of you.
Adjust your speed accordingly. More time between you and the car in front will mean more reaction time in the event of sudden braking or some other emergency., It’s important that you feel safe when driving, and this might mean you need to drive a little slower than the flow of traffic. However, driving too slow can make other drivers around you impatient, leading to dangerous driving situations.The speed of stop-and-go traffic will be greatly reduced, meaning that if you or another car do actually collide, the damage will likely be minimal and not physically serious.

, Impatient drivers can make poor decisions that might require you to take action to prevent an accident. In some cases, you may have to merge out of your lane and onto a shoulder.


Keep your eyes scanning traffic, the shoulder of the road, and potential places you might direct your car in the event that you have to make emergency maneuvers.

, Your emotional state has an effect on your driving ability, and extreme anxiety can negatively impact your ability to handle heavy traffic. If you ever feel too overwhelmed by a driving situation, you should:Exit the freeway and take a break at a rest stop until you’ve calmed down or traffic is lighter.
Turn on your emergency lights and pull well off to the side of the shoulder of the road. Relax a little bit and listen to some music until you are more comfortable with the flow of traffic.

"
"
Give yourself extra space between you and the car ahead.,
Slow your vehicle with engine braking.,
Remain calm when cars tailgate.,
Maintain a constant speed that is slightly slower than traffic.",How to Drive Safely in Heavy Traffic2," You'll want to allow a little more room than you would normally when driving an automatic vehicle. This will give you time to crawl forward in a lower gear while traffic starts to move forward again.


This way you don’t have to spend time, effort, and wear-and-tear on your clutch shifting, and you won't have to ride your clutch while you wait for traffic to resume.
Stop-and-go traffic will likely be best navigated in first or second gear depending on your engine and how these gears handle in your manual transmission vehicle.
Beware impatient drivers cutting you off and merging into the extra space in front of you., Manual transmission vehicles can exert a braking force called “engine braking” or “shift braking” by releasing the accelerator and shifting safely into a lower gear. You’ll have to wait until the RPMs of your car are at an acceptable level for you to downshift, but when you do, your car will experience a gentle braking effect.

When you release the accelerator, the throttle in your engine closes, creating a partial vacuum that creates engine resistance and slows the speed of your vehicle.
Generally, lower gears will exert a greater braking force on your vehicle., Depending on your region or country, there may be slight differences in driving law, but generally drivers are expected to allow cushion distance between the operator’s car and cars in front. This is to protect manual transmission drivers, as stick shifts often roll back slightly when shifting into first gear.


When shifting into first with little space behind you, or if you are on a hill, give your car a little more gas as you shift into first and slowly let out the clutch., Impatient drivers in stop-and-go traffic will often accelerate faster than necessary to traverse the distance between them and the stopped car in front of them. This is highly inefficient, as the unnecessary higher speeds will cost you more in fuel and not get you to your destination any sooner.For a manual transmission, this is even worse because you’ll have to use your clutch to downshift or come to a stop. A better strategy is to:


Accelerate at a steady speed that is slightly below the flow of traffic. This way you can coast forward in your chosen gear without having to downshift or come to a stop.
This slow-but-steady method will also create a solid buffer between you and the car in front of you. You should, however, be ready to downshift if impatient drivers merge into this buffer space."

Be physical and mentally alert - You must be in good physical and mental condition to drive.,
Know your vehicle - Knowing your vehicle can provide the driver with a better understanding how it operates.,
Check vehicle if it is completely functional - When you first enter your vehicle make sure your brakes are functional.,
Fasten the seat belt - To become a smart driver you must always buckle your seat belt.,
Turn on headlights at night and in poor conditions - The number one rule when driving is making sure you have perfect vision of vehicles and also that others can see you.,
Use signals - When ever you switch lanes, leaving the road, moving out from a parked position or turning, you must signal.,
Blind spots - When ever you switch lanes, turn or even cross an intersection, always glance your mirrors and turn your head to check the blind spot for a safe transition.

,
Missing an exit on the freeway - Missing an exit is very common, do not try to squeeze your way to the exit because you might cause an accident or even worse injure yourself.,
Yielding the right-of-way - There are times where you must yield and let the others proceed before you.,
Stay within the speed limit - Obey the maximum speed limit signs along the road, it also allows the drivers to stop safely.,
Keep your distance - leave a three second gap (depending on the speed of your vehicle you might need more than three seconds to stop safely) between vehicles to avoid collisions.,
Pumping the brakes - bad road conditions can cause your wheels to slide out of control, this might happen if you suddenly brake hard, accelerating too quickly or driving too fast around a corner.",How to Drive Smart," Do not drive when you are sick, tired, angry, injured, drinking alcohol or anything that may reduce your ability to drive.;
, There are many different characteristics including anti-lock brakes, 4-wheel drive, automatic and manual vehicles.

, In order to do so, step on your brakes. If you feel there is no pressure, you need a mechanic to check it. Adjust the mirrors, seat and check if your signals are working properly then get into position to drive.

, Make sure everyone is buckled in. Rear passengers become ""Bullet Passengers"" in a collision and will fly forward.

, Use your high beams only when there are no street lights and pitch black.

, Signalling is very important, it provides the other drivers and pedestrians a chance to predict your next movement and also give them 3-5 second heads up so they can react.

,, Just simply proceed driving along the freeway and take the next exit.

, Vehicles approaching on the right have the right-of-way, in cases where intersections have no signs or lights. If you are turning right, you must wait for pedestrians to cross the road first because they have the right-of-way. Also when buses are pulling out their bus stops you must let the bus enter the main road.

, When there is bad weather, heavy traffic or construction you must drive slower with caution.

, To do so select a marker on the road ahead and count three seconds if your vehicle does not pass that marker by the time you counted to three then you're in a good position.

, To avoid skids you must pump the brakes and keep your steering wheel straight.

Be aware of local weather conditions.,
Allow more distance between vehicles.,
Use caution at all times.,
Use fog lights or driving lights (if equipped).,
Use your low beams.,
Don't drift.,
Beware of critters.,
Beware of Freezing Fog.,
Pull over to the side of the road if you have no visibility.,
Use the right edge of the road as a guide.,
Ask for help.",How to Drive Safely in Fog," Fog is often a morning or evening weather phenomena, so if possible, avoid driving during these times. Also be aware of local areas that tend to accumulate fog, like certain seaside areas, and other low lying areas near lakes and rivers.;
, Increase your count distance by 5 seconds instead of the normal 2 seconds behind another vehicle. Never rush or speed to get out of the fog.

, The moisture in the air may continuously collect on the windshield, making it more difficult to see. Adjust the defroster and windshield wiper speed as necessary.

, Many vehicles have fog or driving lights that were installed at the factory. These lights are usually mounted low, in or below the front bumper. They are aimed toward the ground out in front of the vehicle as far as possible. Fog lights mainly differ from driving lights in the way they project the light. Fog lights often have clear or yellow lenses; while driving lights usually have clear lenses. The beam of light created by fog lights is usually wide and flat pattern; flat to stay close the road surface and minimize reflection back by fog - and wide to better illuminate the sides of the roadway (guard rails, curbs, lines painted on the roadway, etc.). Driving lights are usually merely bright spot lights designed to pierce the night darkness further than regular headlights. While fog lights are best for foggy conditions, either type of light will likely perform better than headlights due to their low mounting point on the vehicle. Experiment using all combinations (if possible) of fog / driving lights ""on"" and the low beam headlights ""on"" or ""off"" to determine which setting provides the best forward visibility for the driver. Do not shut off the running or ""parking"" lights, as they help make your vehicle more visible to other drivers alongside and behind your vehicle.

, The visibility in front of you will sharply decrease in a fog, so use the vehicle's low beam lights (if the vehicle does not have fog lights or driving lights). Heavy fog conditions prohibit use of high beam headlights. The light from high beam headlights will be reflected back by thick fog. As fog thins, high beams can become more effective. Check periodically to see if the fog has thinned enough to make use of high beams.

, There's a natural tendency to wander into the middle of the road when visibility gets bad. Be sure to keep yourself in your lane.

, Animals--especially white tail deer--feel bolder under cover of fog and are much harder to see.

, In some climates, fog near the freezing point can freeze on contact with cold surfaces--including roads! This can cause black ice.

, If it gets too difficult or thick, pull over and wait. Turning on your hazard lights alerts other drivers of where you are.

, This can help you avoid running into oncoming traffic or being blinded by oncoming headlights.

, Don't be afraid to ask your passengers to help keep an eye out for oncoming cars and obstacles on the road.

"
"
Depending on the car you have, some of these procedures may need a bit of alteration to work with your specific vehicle.,
Stay alert:


Whenever you are driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings.",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)1," When in doubt, get a better vehicle.


Front-wheel-drive (FWD) vehicles are likely the most restricted. In general, FWD's tend to under-steer (washout) while in a corner when the driver is giving the vehicle gas to accelerate the car out of a turn. This is a bad thing, and greatly restricts the turning capabilities of the vehicle.
Rear-wheel-drive (RWD) cars are more efficient than FWD for cornering and acceleration, but can become a hazard with an inexperienced driver. Donuts can be fun, but not during a critical situation.
All-wheel-drive (AWD) cars have a good balance, but can also under-steer badly if it is not a vehicle with an active or manual center differential (most AWD vehicles have this feature, otherwise they are referred to as part-time 4wd).

Knowing the characteristic of your vehicle is key to performing in extreme situations without putting yourself and others around you in danger. Please read the How to Choose a Car for Tactical Driving article for more information.;
, You should know what cars are around you at all times.
If you are traveling fast, and cars in front of your are slamming on their brakes, you should first attempt to slow down, but you should also be scanning the area for an exit. There isn’t always an exit, but many times there is.

Sometimes the ""exit"" is not a clean exit, and may be a what-will-cause-the-least-damage (CTLD) exit. This may consist of choosing to going off the road completely instead of just onto a shoulder. Choose the safest route before you choose the cheapest route.



Many people become observably more alert after they have recently been in an accident, don’t let that be you. You should be alert to avoid your first accident as well as others around you who may not be paying attention.

Braking is a lost skill.,
Race car drivers, who are always on the edge with their vehicles, have learned the needed skill of separating braking from turning.,
Using your brakes (if you do not have ABS) should be done smoothly.,
Using your brakes (if you have ABS) is much simpler.,
For more information on braking, read How to Brake and Stop a Car in the Shortest Distance.

",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)2," With so many cars with anti-lock brakes (ABS), people just slam on the brakes in any situation. This can be a good option, but it is not always the best. Braking (even with ABS) can cause reduced handling capabilities and actually place you in more danger. Turning while on the brakes can cause the vehicle to neither turn as well as it could without the brakes or cause the vehicle to slowdown less than it could have without turning (read some of the maneuvers for further explanation).

, In 90% of corners, racers (of any race type) use their brakes before they get to the corner, make the corner, then use the gas. Each section of the corner (or the straights before and after the corner) has its own purpose and separation of brakes and turning gives the best traction for the vehicle to make a desired corner.

There is also a technique called ""Trail Braking,"" which is essentially braking while cornering. It is best executed by entering a corner quickly, and braking hard before turning. Continue braking until you have slowed down enough. Trail Braking transfers weight from rear to front, thus pushing the front tires into the ground and giving the car more steering bite. This should only be done with experience, because it can easily backfire.







, Depress your brake pedal, do not slam it to the ground. This is a method called squeezing your brakes, and is essential to get the best braking potential from your vehicle. You bring your vehicle's tires just to the point of breaking traction. While some people say pumping your brakes is a good way to stop, especially on low traction surfaces, it is only a reliable way to stop in an emergency.


This can be easily practiced in an empty parking lot. Roll down your windows and start at one end of the lot. Accelerate to a safe speed (30–40 mph (48–64 km/h) should be good) and slam your brakes as hard and you can. You should hear a good deal of squealing (if you do not, you may have ABS, you may not have disc brakes, or your brakes may need replacing). Now go back the other direction and this time quickly depresses your brakes until you get the squealing again. Go back and forth until you are able to apply your brakes while only hearing a whisper of squealing (this is called the optimal squeeze point – OSP).
What is the whisper of squealing I speak of? This is the point where your tire's rubber is being twisted and contorted to a point that only parts of your tires are actually skidding; this is the absolute limit of your tire's traction, and the quickest way to stop.
You can measure this by setting up markers as to when to start braking and when you stop the car, and you can visually see the difference between your tires locked up and not.
Extra practice: Purposely lock up your brakes. Now practice reducing pressure on the pedal until it stops locking up, then apply pressure to the OSP again).
Take note: each surface and speed will have different OSP's. This is why you should practice while it is dry, then while it is raining, and then when it is snowy (if available). Get yourself adequately adapted to different traction levels so nothing will surprise you.

, In almost all cases, just depressing your brake pedal smoothly (albeit quickly) to the floor is often best. You will likely feel the pedal either vibrate (dependent ABS) or feel like it gives out altogether (independent ABS). Either way it is a sign of the ABS working. Of course, if the pedal feels like it gave out, and you aren't stopping, your brakes probably gave out, in which case you should just kiss it goodbye (or read the wikiHow article, How to Stop a Car with No Brakes).

,"
"
We start with a very simple maneuver, but a very viable skill for normal drivers and technical drivers.,
The scenario: Driving down the freeway, at night, it is raining so there is reduced traction and visibility on the road.,
Solution 1 (no cars around you): You should already know if there are cars near you (read ""Stay alert"" above).,
Solution 2 (cars are around you): This situation is much more tricky.,
If the object were a bit further away, the best decision would probably be to use your brakes for a short period of time, release them most of the way (all the way, and the transfer of weight off your front tires may cause your vehicle to become unstable when you try to swerve, or just under-steer), then swerve.,
To learn more about How to Do an S-Swerve in a Car safely.

",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)3," This skill can save your life when you need to make a sudden direction adjustment with your car.

, You are traveling at 70 mph (110 km/h) and about 100-feet in front of you a large box is in the middle of the road.


This gives you almost exactly one second to decide what the best choice of action is, and execute it.
Being a large box, you deduce there may be something very heavy in the box, and it can damage your car severely and put you and your passengers in danger.

, Do not touch your brakes! With only one second to react braking will only reduce the amount of traction available to your front tires, and may knock your vehicle out of balance, and thus, out of control, during the quick maneuver.


Jerking the wheel toward the desired direction is not the safest way to swerve either (for all the same reasons as braking is unsafe). A controlled swerve is always best. If you out-steer your suspension, your car will only under-steer, possibly causing you to hit the box. You should steer swiftly without being jerky. Once out of the path of the box, roll the wheel the other way to straighten your vehicle out. Again, if you do it too fast you will spin out! Using your brakes before you straighten can also cause you to spin out. Once you are out of the way of the box, you have more time to correct your car's direction, so do not be hasty, and do not overcorrect.
In this situation, no braking is involved, and the first turn away from the box should be done faster than the correction back in to the correct direction.

, If you are unable to move to the lane next to you, you should determine if there is a shoulder you can use. If there is no clean exit, the CTLD exit is likely hitting the box. Use the braking techniques from above and slow down as quickly as possible. A 70 mph (110 km/h) car is not likely to be able to stop in 100-feet, but any reduction in speed will reduce the damage done to you, your passengers, and your car.


In a non-critical (non-tactical) situation: If the box ends up being empty, and no damage is taken, be aware of cars behind you which may rear-end you because you are going slow, or are stopped in the middle of a freeway. Find a safe way to remove the box from the freeway, and continue. If the box does damage your car, be sure you and your passengers are alright. If you are able to safely get the car to the side of the road, do so. Keep it off the road, and stay in the car, the freeway is a dangerous place to be. Call (hopefully you have a cell phone) the police, and report the accident.
In a critical (tactical) situation: if your car still functions properly after hitting the box (if you are trying to get somewhere) continue your journey. If your car does not function properly, hopefully you are not being chased and your life is not threatened by this problem.

, The lower your speed is during the swerve, the safer the swerve will be executed.

,"
"
It is usually initiated from a stopped position, and can get you turned around even in a tight location (without an 8-point turn).

,
For this maneuver to be executed properly, you need enough room to have the car sideways, and then some.,
Drive to one end of the area with your backend pointed in the direction you wish to go.,
As soon as the slide is half-way through, put the car in gear (drive) and be prepared to step on the gas.,
You should practice spinning in both directions.,
If you do not put the car in neutral soon enough, or put in the car in gear (drive) too soon, you have the possibility of messing up your transmission.

",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)4,", It is best practiced in an empty parking lot or dirt area (dirt will give you the same skills, but requires less speed, and will cause less tire wear).

, Accelerate in reverse to 10–30 mph (16–48 km/h).


In a FWD car, this next step is easy. Turn the wheel in one direction to initiate the front end sliding. Giving a bit more gas as soon as you start the turn will help a bit. As soon as the front of the vehicle starts sliding, press the brakes lightly, put the car in neutral, and be ready to put it into gear.
In a RWD car, turn the wheel in one direction to initiate the front end sliding, but at the exact same time, press the brake pedal pretty hard, do not lock up your brakes, but this helps your vehicle pivot on the rear tires. Put the car in neutral, and be ready to put it into gear.

, As soon as you are pointed in the direction you desire to go, hit the accelerator and make any minor adjustments to your driving angle with your steering wheel.

, And experiment with different amounts of gas and brakes at the outset of the slide.

Familiarize yourself with residential traffic laws.,
Inspect your car before you drive it.,
Safely position your hands on the wheel.,
Connect a bluetooth headset or hands free mobile phone device.,
Pay close attention to your speed.,
Stay on your side of the road.,
Come to a complete stop at all stop signs.,
Avoid driving while intoxicated or under the influence.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Observe all rules of the road.,
Notice road conditions.,
Try not to use residential streets as shortcuts.,
Yield to other vehicles.,
Use caution when passing.,
Look for parking prohibitions and regulations.",How to Drive Safely in a Residential Area," Residential traffic laws may have changed depending on how long ago or in which state or country you received your driver’s license.


Visit your state’s DMV website or your local Department of Transportation if you are uncertain about your state or country's residential traffic laws.;
, Look for safety issues such as worn tires, leaking oil or faulty mirrors.


Wear your seatbelt and make sure any passengers are wearing their seat-belts as well.
Buckle children into proper car seats and restraints., Again, which hand position states and countries deem safest vary from state to state and country to country. There are three hand positions that are commonly considered safe: 10 and 2, 9 and 3, and 8 and 4. Keeping your hands in the proper place on the wheel will help you have the safest and quickest response to obstructions should one arise., It is illegal in most states and countries to use a mobile phone while driving a vehicle. If you anticipate the need to make or receive a phone call while driving make sure you have a handsfree option to keep your full attention on the road.It is also generally illegal to wear earbuds in both ears while driving. If your hands free solution involves wearing earbuds, make sure you only have one earbud in at a time.
Pull over if you have an emergency call you need to make or take. Even hands-free devices can sometimes be distracting while you are driving.

, Speeding in residential areas, whether moderate or excessive, can be the difference between life and death. Check for signs posting the maximum speed limit in the residential area you are driving in. Paying attention to your speed and driving slowly will allow you enough time to respond to sudden obstructions in the road.Keep your speed between 20 and 25 mph (32 and 40 km/h) if you do not see any posted signs., Streets in residential neighborhoods are often narrower than major streets and highways. Make sure you are not taking up the whole road, especially when there is oncoming traffic.


If the road is too narrow to pass comfortably, pull over as far as you can onto the shoulder before continuing on.

, Some people are tempted to roll through stop signs, especially on quiet residential streets where they think no one will notice. Check for people who might be crossing the street, and wait for them. Many residential streets do not have crosswalks, so you need to pay attention to anyone who needs to cross.


Look in all directions before you move again.
Pedestrians always have the right of way.

, Do not drive a vehicle if you have been consuming alcohol, illicit substances, or are taking medication that warns against driving. Avoid driving if your judgement and reactions are impaired and try to plan ahead if you anticipate drinking or taking necessary medication.Enlist the help of a friend to take you home or to your next destination.
Call a taxi, Lyft, or Uber instead of driving yourself.

, Make sure to frequently check your mirrors to see what might be beside or behind you. Be alert as your surroundings can change quickly in residential areas.


Use your horn if you think others nearby are dangerously unaware of you presence.
Watch for children who might be playing in or around the streets.
Look for pets that may be running near the streets and pedestrians who may be walking or running on sidewalks or in the road.

, In addition to speed limits and stop signs, pay attention to other traffic rules and regulations.


Look for signs that prohibit U-turns, identify one way streets, and ask you to yield.
Use turn signals when you need to turn, and make sure your lights are on in the evening or during rain, snow, or fog.

, Go especially slow if there are potholes or weather conditions that might make the roads in a residential area slippery or difficult to see. Rain, fog, and snow all reduce the distance you can see and potentially contribute other hazardous conditions.Some residential areas have streets that are not paved and are instead made up of dirt or gravel. Dirt and gravel roads can be difficult to maneuver, so be sure to go slower than usual and take your time.Check the weather forecast if you plan on driving long distances.

, Increased traffic through these streets contributes to a higher risk of injury and makes the neighborhood more dangerous.Try and make a policy of only driving through residential areas if you are stopping at a specific location within that area.

, Yielding to police cars, fire trucks, snow plows, street sweepers and others that might be working to keep the neighborhood safe and clean will reduce the amount of traffic and keep the road as safe as possible.


Watch for bikes, motorcycles, scooters and other smaller vehicles that might be on the roads. They can be harder to spot, especially at night.

, Passing laws are the same in residential and non-residential areas, but extra caution is urged as passing others in residential areas is less common and is not always necessary.Like in non-residential areas, passing stopped or slowed vehicles is allowed, and passing vehicles signaling to turn or driving the speed limit is prohibited.
Be sure to check all traffic ahead, beside, and behind you when passing or being passed by others., Do not park on the side of the road, or in front of someone's house unless it is permitted.


Make sure there is enough room left on the road for motorists to safely pass your car if you do pull over to park.
Watch for parked cars while you are driving. Look for people who might be opening doors to get out of those cars.

The tighter the turn you make, the slower it must be, but if you play your cards right, and make the turn faster than the other guy, then it might give you the edge you need.

,
We'll say (for practice sake) you are going to make a tight left-hand turn around a parking lot light post (one of those tall ones with the concrete base).

,
When you are practicing, you should lay down cones on either side of the car to represent a street.

,
Approaching the turn you should get as far to the right as possible.,
For a 90-degree turn (or less), it is a simple matter of making the turn by going from the right, getting as close to the concrete without hitting it, then exit the turn as far to the right as possible.,
For a 90-135-degree turn, you may need a little cooperation from your vehicle.,
For more than a 135-degree turn, an e-brake turn is necessary.,
Any of these maneuvers done with a RWD or AWD vehicle should not be with any drifting style (with your back-end sliding as you accelerate).",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)5,",,, Use your brakes as late as possible (read the braking instructions above), keep as straight as possible, because turning will make your vehicle slow down...slower.

, This gives you the straightest line possible; naturally, it is also the fastest line.

, Again, approach from the right, but this time use the hand-brake (if available) to bring the back of your car around. Do not use it for too long, else you will spin out. If a hand-brake is not available (i.e.: your vehicle has a foot-base e-brake), then you will have to just take the corner a little slower, so follow the 90-degree turn instructions.

, Do not slow down as much as you would have normally for the turn, instead, drive a few feet past the turn (5 or more feet). While still going at a decent speed and going straight, pull the e-brake. Once the rear tires have locked up, turn the wheel to the left. The car's back end will spin around and point you almost in 180-degrees of your original course. Release the e-brake and drive off.

, Keeping your back-end ""tidy"" is always the fastest way around the corner. If your tires are slipping under power to the point that the back-end swings out, you are giving it too much gas, and letting off the gas would actually accelerate you, or get you through the turn, faster."
"
The PIT maneuver is a procedure which has been used by law enforcement departments around the world (this is also known by some as the Precision Immobilization Technique).,
Before the PIT maneuver is performed, it is assumed that Car A is approaching Car B from behind.,
Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B.,
At speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A.,
If Car A gives the initial tap with enough force, Car B's back-end should slide out.,
Be prepared for Car B to try to drive off as soon as they have slowed enough to regain control.",How to Drive Tactically (Technical Driving)6," Vehicles at high speed are, by laws in physics and aerodynamics, inherently less stable than at lower speeds. The rear of the vehicle is also fundamentally less stable than the front of the vehicle (especially a RWD vehicle, under acceleration).

, The faster the speed (freeway speeds), the greater the advantage Car A has.

, It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A.

, At speeds closer to 40 mph (64 km/h), Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.

, Car A will need to straighten out, as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B. For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B.

, An experienced driver in a FWD vehicle could recover and drive off in the original direction at surprisingly fast speeds. An experienced driver in a RWD vehicle will, once the vehicle is slowed most of the way, likely try to accelerate in the opposite direction of the initial pursuit. AWD vehicles may be able to go either direction.

This is a very difficult and dangerous maneuver, and should only be performed if you have been trained in the technique.
Find out more about this maneuver by reading How to Use the Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT Maneuver) in a Car.

, Confidence is the key in driving, so when you are in the presence of someone with experience, they can guide and give you tips.

, The most common parking positions are uphill, downhill, parallel, and slant. You must know how and when to turn the steering wheel when going into a stall and reversing.

, As you progress, you can try driving at night with caution.

, Use high-beams when there is absolutely no one in your path of sight, including transportation on the other side of the road AND if there are no road lamps (the road is completely dark).

, Ask your parents if they would let you drive to the supermarket for them to shop for groceries or any other small places they would go.

, Try to stay away from racing schools and focus on hands-on training that focuses on crash prevention. Right now Massachusetts is the only state in the country certifying this type of training. They call it Driver Skills Development Program and you can find details here http://www.mass.gov/rmv/driversed/selectschool.htm

Avoid Rear-Enders in Intersections: Move only when it is clear.",How to Drive Defensively," Defensive drivers concentrate on the road, keeping their hands at the 10 o'clock-2 o'clock position. They don't do other tasks while driving, some of which are illegal. These include:


Eating
Applying makeup
Holding a dog
Tending to a child
Operating a hand-held cell phone
Texting;
, Continuously look in your mirrors and scan the road ahead, checking for hazards and slowing traffic so you can anticipate problems before they develop.

, Don't drive if you're tired or upset.

, Most drivers know that speeding is a major cause of accidents, but driving too slow can be dangerous, too. Drive at speeds that most other vehicles are going.

,


Choose a fixed object on the road ahead of you.
Count ""1 independence, 2 independence"" when the car in front of you goes by the object. If you pass the same object before you're done counting, slow down a bit. The 2 second rule helps reduce the chance of a rear-end collision when cars in front make sudden stops.

, Many accidents occur because drivers didn't see the other car. There are a few simple ways to make your presence known, making the road safer for everyone. They include:


Turn signals: Use your turn signals to let other drivers know where you're going. By using your blinkers, other drivers will be able to anticipate your actions and slow down safely.
Headlights: Turn on your headlights at dusk or anytime it is raining. This is more for other drivers to see you than for you to see the road. In some states it is illegal to drive without your headlights on while the windshield wipers are in operation.
Brake lights: Operational brake lights are a safety must. They warn cars behind you that you're slowing down, signaling them to reduce speed, too.
Avoid blind spots: Don't linger in areas where the driver in front of you can't see you. Many people will only check their mirrors before making a lane change. If you're lurking slightly behind and a lane away from another vehicle, assume that the driver of that car can't see you. Either safely speed up or slow down to avoid this scenario, which often results in an accident. This is an important defensive-driving technique.

, Aggressive drivers may infuriate you, but retaliating with similar tactics is dangerous. Take a passive approach in dealing with road rage. Use these strategies in specific road-rage scenarios:


Tailgaters: If the driver behind you is right on your bumper, tap the brakes a few times to let the driver know that he's not maintaining a safe distance. If he stays on your tail, slow down gradually. Chances are the tailgater will eventually pass you.
Speeders: If you see a car speeding or aggressively changing lanes behind you, stay in your lane while maintaining your speed.

, Even light rain can produce dangerous conditions, particularly early in the season when the water picks up oil from the road surface, making it slippery. Tires lose their grip at higher speeds, so slowing down in inclement weather is a fundamental defensive-driving technique.

, Refresh your memory by browsing a Department of Motor Vehicles pamphlet detailing the rules of the road. It provides guidelines on rights of way, road signs, traffic law, and contains tips on safe driving.

, Sometimes an intersection gets backed up with traffic.

If you're the first car to go at green, make sure traffic on the other side of the intersection that you are moving into has cleared before you decide to go. This can prevent you from getting in a situation where you might get T-boned if you get stuck or stalled in an intersection.
Turning into an intersection: a lot of rear-end collisions happen when the driver behind you assumes you are going to complete the turn, even if traffic is backed up.
Give yourself enough room: if you must stop in an intersection, slow down carefully and keep distance from any other cars that have yet to complete the intersection. If the person behind you 'flip-flops' and rear-ends your car, you'll save yourself the trouble the car in front of you is not involved.

Prepare your vehicle for driving.,
Turn on the front and rear defroster to keep windows clear while you drive.,
Turn on your headlights at all times as you drive.,
Drive slowly while the roads are covered in snow or ice.,
Keep the appropriate intervals in between your car and the car ahead of you.,
Avoid making sudden movements while you drive.",How to Drive in the Snow1," Clear the windshield, side windows, headlights, and rear brake lights of all snow and ice with an ice scraper and brush before you drive. Stop the car and clear the windows and lights as needed while driving during snowfall., Turn the air conditioning on and set it to the fresh air option to keep the inside window clear of condensation.

, This means you have to have your headlights on when driving during daylight hours too. This makes your vehicle more visible to other motorists while the snow is falling.

, Drive using the lower gears in a manual vehicle to increase your traction on the road. Do not use the cruise control option and do not attempt to pass other vehicles.Vehicles need traction in order for the brakes to work properly, which is why slower speeds, gentler turns, and stops are necessary to make traction remain possible.Reduce the vehicle’s speed to at least half the speed posted on as the speed limit. Be extremely cautious of how much traction your tires can achieve against the road as you drive.

, Leave at least 2 to 3 car lengths between your car and the one ahead of you. This is the most effective way to deter common rear end accidents.This will give you enough room to stop and lower the risk of sliding into the car in front of you when driving at a slow speed.
Driving at a speed over 25 mph (40 km/h) may require leaving more space between the vehicles.

, When you stop, don’t jerk the steering wheel. Instead, touch your brakes gently. Don’t lock brakes on ice either because it might result in losing the control and steering of your vehicle.Accelerate more gradually than you’re accustomed to. Don’t rev up to the speed limit like you’re used to when the roads are clear, get up to that speed slowly but surely.
Decelerate more gradually than you’re accustomed to. Anticipate your stops before you actually make them. Slow down to stops slower than usual.

Watch out for potential road dangers.,
Do not push the accelerator and spin the car tires when stuck in a snow-filled area.,
Recover from the rear end of your car beginning to skid.,
Recover from the front end of your car starting to skid.,
Push the brake pedal gently when you need to stop.",How to Drive in the Snow2," Be on the lookout for slippery spots that might be in the road. Ice is common on bridges, even when the rest of the road made be clear, so approach bridges and shaded areas with the proper caution., Dig loose snow out from under the tires and pour sand or kitty litter under the tires to create traction. Gently rock the car to help the tires make contact with the ground, if possible.

, If you notice despite the distance and precautions of safe winter driving that the rear end of your car is starting to skid, you have to avoid the hazard as gently as possible.


Remove your foot from the accelerator if the rear end of the car begins to skid while driving on snow or ice.
Steer out of the skid by turning the steering wheel in the direction you want the car to turn.
Turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction if the car over-recovers from the skid.

, Remove your foot from the accelerator if the front end of the car begins to skid. Do not brake while in the skid.


Turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the car to turn.
Shift the car into neutral if driving a manual transmission.

, If you can avoid stopping altogether, that’d be even better. Gradually slow down your car almost to a complete stop when you are nearing a red light. It might turn green without you even having to stop at all.If you see a line of cars stopped in front of you, start pressing your brakes several feet back to avoid rear ending anyone accidentally.
If you notice that your tires have locked up, take your foot off of the brakes completely.

Inspect your coolant system.,
Assess the condition of your battery.,
Schedule a tune up for your vehicle.",How to Drive in the Snow3," When temperatures drop, your tire pressure drops in response. Check to see if air pressure in your tires need to be recharged, especially in cold climates of 30 degrees and below., Traction is always important when operating a vehicle, but become even more crucial to cars in inclement weather of snow and ice. Inspect your tire threads thoroughly to gauge their efficiency.Use a penny to help you determine the depth of your tires’ treads. Insert a penny with its head toward the tire tread into the groove. If the back of the penny is covered, your tire tread is in the clear. If you can see the entire back of the coin, it’s time for new tires.
Additional signs that you should consider buying new tires include: nicks and holes, uneven wear, and bulging sidewalls on the tires.

, Snow tires are better than regular tires because they are made with special materials that stay soft to provide tires with maximum traction in below freezing temperatures. They also have tread patterns that grip snow covered and ice covered roads.Install winter tires in sets of fours to maintain the traction, safety, and control of your vehicle. If or when the weather warms up, it is important to change out the tires for all-season or summer tires.Carry a set of snow chains for your vehicle while you travel. Although it might not be necessary to install them on a car that has snow tires installed on it, having snow chains are a requirement when passing certain roads throughout the winter season.

, Place the snow chain over the tire, holding it at the top and letting it fall evenly over the front of the tire and wheel. Once the chain is evenly and securely placed on the three quarters of the wheel not touching the road, place the snow chains onto the rest of the tires.When the snow chains are on three quarters of all of the tires, get into your car and drive forward for less than a meter. This will expose the part of the tire that was touching the ground previously.
Put on the brake, get out of the car, and finish securing the remaining chains to the rest of the wheel. Use a closer link to tighten the chains where they close.
Adding snow chains to your vehicle might be necessary during drives in some states, but often times if you have snow tires installed, you can save yourself a little trouble and not have to bother adding snow chains to your vehicle at all.

, Inspect the blades of your wipers ahead of the winter time to ensure that your wipers will have a quick response to whatever may potentially obstruct your vision while you drive. If your blades don’t sweep across the windshield cleanly or are cracked, replace them immediately.Also make sure that your windshield defroster is up to par. Replacing your blades will be an insufficient move if your defroster isn’t in working order.

, Make sure the fluid levels in your radiator are adequate. Confirm that you have the proper coolant in the car’s system. Check to see that all of the hoses are in good working condition and do not have any obvious indications of wear., Cold weather can deplete an older battery at an accelerated rate. Look at the top of the battery for the installation date.If the date on the battery is older than two or three years, think about purchasing a new one before winter begins.
Remove any signs of whitish powder that might have gathered on the terminal connections. Clean away the buildup with an equal parts baking soda and warm water solution.

, Ensure that your engine is performing at optimal performance level by having a mechanic or auto service. If you’re good with cars, feel free to conduct your own inspection at home."

Check the depth of the mud.,
Engage traction control.,
Switch to 4WD.,
Go to a lower gear.,
Go easy on the gas and brake pedals.,
Avoid any deep ruts.,
Correct a front wheel skid.,
Inspect your car for damage afterwards.",How to Drive in the Mud1," Before you hit a muddy stretch of road, if it looks deep at all, hop out of your vehicle and take a closer look. Get a stick and test the depth of the mud by sinking it in. Try to spot any objects hidden in the mud, such as large rocks, which could damage the underside of your vehicle.Expect that you will get a bit dirty checking out the road, but it could save you lots of time and hassle in the long run. Make sure that it is safe to get out of your vehicle by checking for traffic and environmental hazards.;
, Many newer model vehicles come with a standard traction control option. This feature may automatically engage when you hit poor driving conditions. If that isn’t the case, then you’ll need to activate it by pressing a button which is usually located on the dash or console area. Check your owner’s manual for more details about your particular vehicle.However, be aware that the traction control may make it more difficult for your vehicle to climb out of the mud if it gets stuck. In this case, disengage the traction feature and only turn it back on when you are moving once again.

, Locate your gear lever or switch on your dashboard or console area. You will see a series of labels, like 2H, right next to it. When you need that extra boost of traction, move the lever or switch to the position of 4H or 4L. Going to 4H will engage all four wheels on your vehicle. However, if the road is really nasty, go ahead and move to 4L, as this will cause your tires to move more slowly but with greater gripping power.Be aware that all-wheel drive vehicles will not have the 2H option, as they use all four tires all the time.
Some 4WD systems can begin to seize and dry out if they not used over a long period of time. Try to use your 4WD every two months or so, even it if’s just on slightly wet roads., If you are driving a 2WD, go ahead and move down to the second or third gear. Depending on the design of your vehicle, this usually just requires that you move the gear lever down to the spot marked “2” or “3.” This will allow you to keep a consistent pace across a difficult, muddy road. Switch back to a higher gear whenever you hit more stable roads to lessen the pressure on your engine and wheels., Try to keep going for as long as you can by using your initial momentum. Keep a steady, medium speed. If you do need to press the gas pedal, do so slowly to avoid causing the tires to spin out. Also, be aware that you might skid if you hit the brakes too hard.Avoiding any rapid speed changes gives your tires a moment to adjust to the terrain and get a good grip., The goal is to place your tires in an untouched part of the road or within the highest rut area possible. Otherwise, you run the risk of sinking into lower/deeper ruts or even getting stuck on the middle area between ruts. This is an especially important step to follow if you are driving on a road that is frequented by larger vehicles, such as semi-trucks.It is helpful to know the ground clearance of your vehicle, or the space that be measured between your vehicle’s undercarriage and the road. This will give you a better idea how your vehicle will handle ruts or deeper patches of mud.

, If your vehicle continues to travel straight or to the side, even when you turn the steering wheel, then you are in a skid. Let off the gas and wait for the vehicle to slow down. As your car slows, wait for the front wheels to gain control once more. Then, turn your steering wheel in the same direction. This should let you regain control over the whole vehicle.Resist the urge to slam on the brakes if you begin to skid. This will only cause you to lose control faster.
Hidden patches of ice under the mud can cause you to skid out. That is why you take essentially the same actions to regain control on a muddy road as you would on an icy one., When you are back on dry road, pull over in a safe spot and walk around your vehicle looking for any problems. Examine your undercarriage to make sure that all brake lines and other parts are undisturbed. Take a moment to wipe any mud off your side mirrors and windows as well.Drive slowly as you go out of the mud, so that your tires will have a sufficient chance to toss off all of the mud chunks.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in the year 2012 31 percent of all fatal traffic accidents in the United States involved an alcohol-impaired driver.
Any driver with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is considered to be alcohol-impaired in the eyes of the law and if you are caught, you may be arrested, forced to pay a fine, charged with a DUI and/or sentenced to jail time.You can easily avoid drunk driving by arranging to get a ride home with a designated driver, getting a cab, or arranging to stay at someone else's house. Drink driving is never worth the risk.;
, Being distracted while driving is a bad idea, as you can't give your full attention to the road and your reaction time becomes slower as a result.









Using cell phones while driving -- whether you're making a call, texting or doing something else -- is seriously detrimental in terms of its effect on your attention to driving. If you need to make a call, pull over and stop the car first.
Aside from using cell phones, a distraction counts as anything that takes your full attention off the road, whether it's fiddling with the radio, checking or applying make-up, or eating food. All of these things should be avoided.
Also be careful when driving with children and pets, as they can be a potential distraction. Make sure children are secured with seat belts and pets are contained in a pet carrier.

, Feeling sleepy behind the wheel is almost, if not just as dangerous as driving while under the influence of alcohol, especially at night. In fact According to a study by Virginia Tech, drowsy drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a crash or near-crash.








Driver drowsiness does not necessarily mean falling asleep behind the wheel (though this is highly dangerous), it can also refer to a driver zoning out for just a moment or two -- enough time to cause a serious accident.
You can avoid potential drowsiness behind the wheel by always getting a good night's sleep -- eight hours per night, if possible. You should also take frequent breaks while driving (especially if you feel yourself getting tired) to get some fresh air or drink a coffee. Share the driving responsibilities with another driver, if possible.
You also need to be very cautious about taking medications which may cause drowsiness. If you are taking a cold medication or antihistamine, always read the warnings on the label.

, Wearing a seat belt while driving is essential -- according to the NHTSA, wearing a seat belt can the reduce the risk of fatal injury to passengers aged 5 and above by 45%, and reduce the rate of moderate to serious injury by 50%.Wearing a seat belt prevents the occupants of a car from being thrown around the vehicle or being propelled through the windshield during a crash, thus helping to prevent broken bones, severe head trauma, lacerations and the possibility of being run over by another vehicle.
Although you sometimes hear frightening stories about people who become trapped in their car as a result of wearing their seat belt, this is an anomaly and only counts for a tiny percentage of accidents. In the vast majority of accidents, the seat belt will work in your favor.

, Even though sitting in a traffic jam or dealing with another driver's bad behavior can be extremely frustrating, it's important to stay calm while driving. Getting angry or upset will only distract you and make you more likely to do something dangerous.









Avoid doing anything that could aggravate other drivers, like flashing your headlights, beeping your horn, or making rude hand gestures. This kind of behavior can distract other drivers and potentially cause an accident.
If another driver does something dangerous or acts aggressively towards you, keep your cool and yield to the other driver, or let them pass you by. The sooner they're out of your way, the better.

, It may seem obvious, but observing the speed limit is a vital part of safe driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ""speeding was a contributing factor in 30 percent of all fatal crashes"" in the year 2011.Remember that the higher the speed, the less time you have to react to the traffic around you, and collisions are far more likely to be serious if they occur at speed.
For shorter trips, speeding is only going to save you a couple of minutes of time, but it greatly increases the risk of a serious accident. If you need to be somewhere on time, just leave earlier.

, It's very important to avoid following another car too closely, as this gives you less time to react if the driver in front of you decides to brake or turn suddenly. For safety, drivers are advised to maintain a distance of three seconds between their car and the car in front of them.









The distance is measured in time rather than feet (or other units of measurement) as it can be difficult to judge distances while driving, and what counts as a safe distance varies depending on speed.
To judge the minimum safe distance according to the three second rule, pick a stationary object on the side of the road like a lamppost or mailbox. When the car in front of you passes this object, begin to count the seconds -- at least three seconds should pass before you pass the same object.

, Being a good driver involves tailoring your driving to the surrounding conditions -- whether you're faced with bad weather, poor visibility, or simply driving at night.









Driving in poor conditions requires you to be even more cautious than you normally would -- you should drive slower than the speed limit, maintain additional space between your car and the car in front of you and be very careful around twists and bends.
If it's dark, foggy or raining, you should also remember to turn on your lights -- you need to be seen if you want to avoid getting hit!
Remember to stop and clean off fogged or iced windows to improve visibility. A surface treatment (such as ""Rain-X"") can help to improve visibility through rained-on glass.
Of course, the safest thing to do is to avoid driving in poor weather conditions altogether. If there's very bad rain, snow or ice on the road, you should consider staying at home if possible.

, When driving, you should never assume that everyone else on the road will act in a safe, responsible manner, or that they will react to a situation in the same way as you.









As a result, you need to be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times, and be ready to react instantly to what's going on around you. This is known as driving defensively.
Some specific bad driving practices to watch out for include: failing to use the turn signal, changing lanes unexpectedly, stopping suddenly, speeding, swerving and tail-gating.

, Don't just pay attention to the cars and road in front of you -- you should be scanning more-or-less constantly, using your mirrors to watch the cars on either side and behind you.









However, every vehicle has blind spots -- so know where yours are, and make allowances for those of other vehicles. Always check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder before turning or changing lanes.
You could also consider getting a blind-spot mirror, but be aware that anything in it is much smaller than it appears.
Don't block your vision -- avoid putting decals on your windows or hanging dangling objects (like furry dice) from your rear-view mirror.

, Driving on ice requires special care, so here are some pointers:









If you find yourself suddenly on ice (or black ice) do not slam on the brakes; you could lose all control. If you must slow down, put your vehicle in a lower gear and/or apply brakes lightly and steer straight.
When driving on ice, do not turn your steering wheel. Serious accidents often occur in winter, when drivers turn their wheels on ice. Turning the wheel has little or no effect, until the car passes the ice and the tires suddenly regain their traction. Once the tires regain traction, the vehicle will steer violently to the side, potentially causing an accident.

, Always, always use your turn signals to indicate where and when you're going to turn. This gives other drivers time to react -- making it both the safest and most courteous thing to do.









Signal as soon as you decide that you would like to make a turn, then look for a space into which to make the turn, not vice versa. This gives other drivers more time to notice you, and perhaps even open up a space for you.
These rules also apply when you are changing lanes, as suddenly switching lanes without giving the drivers around you advanced warning can be very dangerous.
Turns into traffic (for example, left turns in right-hand-drive countries) are especially hazardous, and should be avoided if possible. Plan your trip to make turns with the traffic whenever possible.

, Trucks are a special hazard; their drivers cannot see other vehicles as well as you can in a car.









Therefore, it's important to give trucks extra space -- you can do this by observing a six second rule (instead of three second) when driving behind a truck.
Be extremely careful when overtaking a truck. If there is an accident between a car and a truck, the driver of the car will be the one most at risk.

, When you try to run a red light, you take the risk that another car will turn or pull out in front of you, right into your path.









It is equally likely that a pedestrian (perhaps a child) might step out into the crosswalk, trying to cross the street. If either of these things happen, there is likely to be a serious accident and no one will be at fault except you.
Keep in mind that it is exceptionally difficult for another driver to tell how fast you are going or whether your are about to accelerate or stop when they are approaching you head on.

, Regularly check the mechanical features of your car, making sure to include the headlights and taillights, the brakes and the suspension.









If you don't feel comfortable doing these things yourself, send your car to a capable mechanic.
The failure of any of these components can create a dangerous situation while driving.

, For example, if your wheel falls off and you have an accident, your insurance company will find that you are at fault.









Minor things count, too. Change windshield wiper blades when they begin to streak the windshield during use.
Also keep your windshield washer reservoir filled regularly to clear mud or debris from your windshield.

, This will give the best traction, mileage, and performance.









Make sure the tire pressure is even -- uneven pressure can lead to poor performance or even a blowout.
Replace worn tires. Remember that wet traction deteriorates before tread wears to its legal limit because the water has only smaller places to be squeezed out to; replacing at 4/32 can be wise.Check your spare when you check your four tires.

Determine if passing is legal.,
Know what kind of street you’re driving on.,
Be aware of other possible obstacles.,
Scan the road for other cars.,
Check your blind spot.,
Signal that you want to pass.,
Do not try to pass if another car is trying to pass you.,
Be patient.,
Determine what kind of vehicle you are passing.,
Gently accelerate to pass.,
Re-enter your lane.",How to Determine when It's Safe to Pass," There are many factors and signals to let you know whether it is legal to pass or not. Staying alert and knowledgeable will not only keep you safe from accidents but also ensure that you aren’t accidentally breaking the law.


Know the local laws. There are many specific situations and locales where passing is illegal. For example, passing is illegal is when you are behind a school bus that is loading or unloading children. Depending on where you live, there may be other locally-specific laws that prohibit passing as well so be sure to investigate those.
Check the line on the road. If the line is solid, that means it is illegal to pass. Only pass if the line along the road is dotted.However, even if the line is dotted, it is illegal to pass if there are other road conditions that impede your ability to pass safely, such as bad weather conditions and heavy traffic.
Check road signs as you drive. Signs that say “Do Not Pass” and others indicating that you should not pass should always be obeyed.;
, If you are driving on a four-lane road or divided highway, it is generally easier and safer to pass. However, if you are attempting to pass in a two-lane road, it is much more dangerous as there is always the possibility of hitting oncoming traffic. Knowing what kind of road you are driving on and following the necessary precautions will help ensure yours and others’ safety.


If you are driving on a two-lane road, it is not recommended to pass the driver ahead of you unless there’s a serious reason to, such as the other car driving below the speed limit. You must also be positive that you will have enough time to merge back into your original lane before running into any oncoming traffic.
Take note of the amount of cars on the road and the speed at which traffic is moving in order to estimate how much time you have. A general rule is that you should be able to pass and return to your lane without coming within 200 feet (61 m) of a car heading towards you, but it is safest to wait until there are absolutely no cars in sight heading in the opposite direction., Though drivers often only focus on the road ahead, you should always be aware of the entire area you are driving in. As a general rule, you should never pass if you have a restricted view or are driving in an unpredictable or unfamiliar area.


Hills and curves can restrict your view and make it difficult to see oncoming traffic. If at any time your line of sight is restricted by a hill, weather conditions, or other circumstances, do not attempt to pass.If you see cars on side roads that merge into the lane you are trying to move into, be sure to give them the right of way as they likely are not watching for you.
Non-vehicular obstacles are also something to watch out for. For example, if there is a slew of bikers or deer darting about in rural areas, you want to be sure there is no chance that you will hit them.
Watch for erratic or reckless drivers. If you see a car swerving all over the road, it’s better to stay far behind them than try to pass.
It’s impossible to list every scenario where passing is not a good idea as it’s often unpredictable, so always use your good judgment and err on the side of caution.

, Are you in a busy, congested area where there are lots of other cars to be aware of or are you in an almost deserted area? If you are on a road with lots of traffic, it may be best to just stay in your lane unless you are an experienced and confident driver.


Check the road ahead simply by looking ahead but also be sure to see what the traffic is like behind you by using your rearview and side mirrors. Drivers have a tendency to only look ahead but you should be aware of your entire surroundings at all times.
As you watch for drivers and other potential obstacles, be sure that you are still driving smoothly and following all other laws. When attempting to pass, some drivers begin to speed without even realizing it so be sure to stick to all other good driving habits.

, A blind spot is an area of the road that can’t be seen in your car mirrors.When determining if it’s safe to pass, you must always check your blind spot instead of only relying on your mirrors.


To check your blind spot, do a “shoulder-check.” This involves turning your head to look over your shoulder towards the lane you want to merge into. Failure to check the blind spots is how many accidents are caused, particularly with motorcyclists so never forget this important step before passing.
Each car is unique so it’s always best to know exactly where and how big your blind spots are. You can check this by adjusting the side mirrors until you can see along the side of your parked car on each mirror by looking, without having to turn your head.Then, have a friend stand on the sides of the car in various spots until you figure out at which points you need to do a shoulder-check in order to see them.

, One study has found that failure to use turn signals is a leading cause of car accidents.Always use your turn signal to let other drivers know you want to pass in order to avoid accidents and not break the law.


Activate your turn signal at least 100 feet (30.5 m) before changing lanesand be sure to turn it off once you have changed lanes.
Even if there are no cars around you, you still must always signal before changing lanes. After all, you could get caught by a hidden cop or camera. Additionally, signalling will eventually become second nature to you and you will perform this step automatically.

, If you see a car approaching from behind at a rapid speed or if a car is flashing its turn signal at you, you should always play it safe and allow them to pass you first.


If you already have your turn signal on, turn it off at this point to signal to the other driver that you are going to wait to pass after they do.
If a car behind you has its turn signal on but is not taking any further action to pass, the driver may have simply forgotten to turn off their turn signal. However, it is still safer to not attempt to pass until it absolutely clear that the driver behind you has no intention of passing you.

, Some drivers will speed up or purposely try to prevent you from passing, particularly in bad traffic. Rather than being an aggressive driver and swerving in, make sure that the other drivers are making room for you to safely pass.


If, after activating your turn signal, you see that the car ahead of you is speeding up, do not try to pass. Different drivers have many reasons for not allowing others to pass. In some cases, it can even be as simple as the driver not noticing your turn signal and accelerating on their own initiative. Don’t make assumptions or take other drivers’ behaviors personally.

, Bear in mind that passing a semi-truck requires different considerations than passing a regular automobile. Understand that some vehicles are more dangerous to pass than others and understand how you can minimize this risk.


Semi-trucks have bigger blind spots, meaning parts of the road where they cannot see other drivers. These are called “no-zones” and consist of the area along both sides of the trucks that can’t be viewed by the mirrors and the areas immediately in front of and behind the truck.Be mindful of the fact that you are invisible to the truck driver in these areas when making the decision to pass. You should only pass trucks if you can confidently drive ten miles faster than them without breaking the speed limit.
Never pass a semi-truck that is going at the speed limit or above. Not only would you be breaking the law, but you are far more likely to get into a life-threatening accident.
When passing motorcyclists or bicyclists, you must change lanes completely. Some drivers may be tempted to only change into half the lane in order to get back into their original lane faster, but this is both illegal and poses a great hazard for the cyclist you are passing. Always make sure to give them as much distance as possible to avoid a possible accident.

, Some drivers have a tendency to stomp on the gas pedal in order to pass as quickly as possible but it is better to gradually increase your speed as you are less likely to alarm other drivers and you will have more control over your car.


Wait until you are about a car length away from the car you are passing and then speed up to 10–15 mph (16–24 km/h) faster than the car you are passing.
Remember, you should have already activated your turn signal so the driver ahead of you knows you are passing.
Know when to ease up on the speed. Only accelerate as much as you need to in order to pass and make sure to not break the speed limit.

, Re-entering your original lane is not necessary if you are in a multiple-lane highway but it is required if you are in a two-lane highway. Before re-entering the lane, take note of the following to ensure it is safe to do so.


Check the rearview and side mirrors to make sure that other vehicles are at a safe distance. Make sure you are at least three cars’ lengths ahead of the car you have passed before.
If you are in a traffic-heavy area, take note of the other cars around you as well. For example, there may be another car ahead of you that is signalling to enter the same lane. Allow them to change lanes first.
Do the shoulder-check to make sure nothing is in your blind spots. Motorcyclists and other vehicles can sneak up on you, so don’t forget this step.
Before re-entering your lane, activate your turn signal to communicate your intention to change lanes to the other vehicles around you.

Turn on your hazard lights.,
Watch for oncoming vehicles.,
Try to rock the vehicle.,
Lower your tire pressure a bit.,
Apply sand or litter to the ground.,
Place your car mats under your tires.,
Dig out with a shovel.",How to Drive in the Mud2," If you somehow manage to get stuck, make your vehicle visible to others by flipping the switch to activate your hazard blinkers. If you have flares, activate them and place them around the outside of your car.

, Before you leave your vehicle, check your mirrors to see if any other cars are approaching. Go slowly when you do decide to get out to avoid slipping in the mud. If the conditions are too dangerous, stay in your car and call for emergency assistance., Turn your steering wheel so that your tires face straightforward. Apply just a slight amount of pressure to the gas pedal and switch gears between drive and reverse. Stop everything if you feel the tires spinning continually. Turn the wheel so that your tires are at an angle and try again.For manual vehicles, this maneuver works best when in the highest gear. For automatics, go with the lowest gear possible., If you get stuck in the mud, go to each tire and let out some air. Do this by applying a slight amount of pressure to the valve stem. Wait until you hear some air escaping and then re-check the pressure once more. This will give you some additional surface traction. Make sure to re-inflate them when you are back on solid ground., Before each muddy season, store a bag of sand or a small container of kitty litter in your vehicle. If you get stuck, sprinkle the litter or sand around your tires to help with traction., If you are stuck, shift gears to park. Remove the mats from your car and place a single mat under each tire. Let the mat just barely touch the tire with the rest of it facing forward. This will give your car some solid ground to grip onto. When you get back on solid ground, go back to retrieve your mats.In the place of mats, you can also use two to four carpet strips or even pieces of cardboard., Keep a foldable outdoor shovel in the back of your vehicle. When you are stuck, use this shovel to dig out the space around your tires. If you can remove enough moisture from the area, then your tires will be able to grip the remaining dry ground.If you get desperate, look for items in your car that you can use as a shovel. For example, a spare tire cover could be used to lift away the dirt.

Avoid mud prone areas.,
Choose the right tires.,
Maintain the correct tire pressure.,
Carry safety items and traction aids with you.,
Take a driving course.",How to Drive in the Mud3," A road that is unusually porous with poor drainage can become a mess really fast. Be especially careful if the area has experienced heavy rains or snow recently. Before you head out on a drive, especially in an unfamiliar location, it might be helpful to take a quick look at a weather app on your phone to see if the driving conditions might include rain or snow.

, If you know that you will be driving a route with bad road conditions, try switching from all-terrain tires to a snow or mud tire. A mud tire has deeper grooves and grips, which can minimize sinking and improve traction. These tires will be louder on standard highways, as opposed to standard all-terrain tires, but the annoyance may be worth it during muddy seasons.As you are shopping for a mud tire, make sure to get one that does well on wet road conditions. Due to the deep treads, some mud tires have a tendency to lose grip on smooth, wet surfaces.

, Look in your owner’s manual or on the interior panel of your driver’s door for information regarding the proper tire pressure for your vehicle. Keeping your tires at this pressure, or just slightly under, will greatly improve the tire grip. It is a good idea to make pressure check on all of your tires part of your monthly care maintenance routine., At the start of each muddy or rainy season, look of the contents of your car emergency kit. Make sure that you have flashlights, flares, and a warm blanket. To cope with muddy conditions, you’ll also want a tow strap and a jack. The jack may come as part of a tire changing kit., Some driving schools offer classes that focus on navigating a vehicle over rough terrain and during poor weather conditions. Find a school near you by entering “off-road driving school” or “safety driving school” and your location into a search engine.For example, some schools will show drivers how to correctly attach tow straps and how to safely use other recovery strategies."
"
Cross only at designated crosswalks.,
Initiate an available pedestrian signal.,
Cross when the WALK signal comes on.,
Cross very carefully if there are no pedestrian signals.,
Find the safest means to cross with no crosswalk.",How to Cross the Street1," Look for painted lines on the roadway that indicate a safe crosswalk that allows pedestrians to cross the street. In the United States, these will always be painted in white and perpendicular to the street. If you are in another country, you may have a different system in place; check with your local transportation department for more information.


Some crosswalks use several rectangular “blocks” of paint to indicate where you should walk across, while others use two parallel lines to designate the crossing area.
You will typically find crosswalks at an intersection with another street, or sometimes in the middle of a block in very high foot traffic areas.;
, Look for a button to press near a crosswalk that signals the WALK/DON’T WALK pedestrian lights to change. When available, these buttons are necessary to use in order to cross safely.


Once you’ve pressed the button to initiate the pedestrian signals, wait patiently on the sidewalk or curb for the signal to change to WALK, or whatever symbol is used in your area to indicate it is safe to cross.
If there is no pedestrian-initiated button, cross with extra caution when the regular traffic light turns to green, or when vehicles at stop signs see you and allow you to cross.

, Cross the street only when the pedestrian signal changes to white letters that say WALK, a white symbol of a person walking, or another symbol used in your area to indicate “walk.” Look both ways down the street to further ensure that it is safe to cross.


Always look to your left, then your right, then your left again before crossing any street. In the U.S., this helps you see the immediately oncoming traffic in the lane you will walk into first. In countries where traffic is on the left side of the street, you should look right-left-right.
Pay attention to the pedestrian signals, not the traffic lights for vehicles, if both are available. Just because you see a green traffic light does not necessarily mean it is safe for you to cross as a pedestrian.An orange hand symbol, the words DON’T WALK, or another symbol will begin flashing, or a countdown will begin, when your time to cross is running out. Do not cross when you see the static DON’T WALK signal.
Make eye contact with drivers at the intersection that you are crossing in front of, to make sure they see you and you see them if they signal at you in any way. This is especially important for crossing a street with stop signs rather than stop lights.

, When there are no WALK/DON’T WALK signals for you to cross a street, use extra caution. Stay in the crosswalk and proceed whenever a traffic light turns green or cars at a stop sign see you crossing.


When at a traffic light intersection, wait till the lights turn green for the vehicles going in the same direction as you. Look both ways and pay attention to any drivers that could be turning into your path.When at a stop sign intersection, take special care to make eye contact with the drivers on either side of the street you’re crossing when they are stopped at a stop sign. You may see them “wave you on” or make any other indication that they see you and want you to proceed.

, If there is no crosswalk available in a rural area, go to the nearest intersection or most well-lit area and proceed to cross with extra caution when there are no oncoming cars.Ensure that there is no traffic in either direction, or vehicles are very far away, before crossing. Look left and right several times before you make your move to cross, even in a rural or low-traffic area.
Note that it is not safe to cross a high-speed or high-traffic street, like the frontage road for a highway, without a crosswalk at an intersection. In this case, you must walk on the sidewalk to an intersection where there are stop signs, stop lights, or crosswalks. Do not attempt to cross without the assistance of road markings and signals.

"
"
Pay attention to traffic lights.,
Obey right-of-way at stop signs.,
Cross according to all other signs and signals.",How to Cross the Street2," Obey traffic lights carefully when approaching an intersection controlled by them where you want to cross the street. Follow green for go, yellow for slow, and red for stop.


Pay particular attention to traffic that may be crossing your path, even when the light is green for you. These could include cars from the cross street that run a red light illegally, or vehicles from the other side of the street who make unprotected left turns (or right turns in some countries).Gauge when to slow down for yellow lights very carefully. You shouldn’t speed up to cross while a light is still yellow, but you also should not abruptly brake right before an intersection and risk causing an accident. Slow down when you can do so safely, or proceed through the yellow light with caution.

, Yield to other drivers when you approach an intersection controlled by one, two, or four stop signs, or an uncontrolled intersection with no stop signs at all. Slow down and obey yield signs in the same manner as stop signs when other traffic is present.


In general, and at four-way stops (all streets have stop signs), any driver should observe right-of-way by letting whoever got there first proceed. If two or more drivers arrive at the stop sign at the same time, the driver to your right proceeds. If it is still unclear, a driver going straight will proceed first before one turning.At a two-way stop or a T-shaped three-way intersection, the driver at a stop sign should always wait for traffic to completely clear on the through street that does not have any stop signs.
At an uncontrolled intersection, where there are no stop signs, a driver should slow down and be prepared to stop and wait for any drivers already in the intersection to pass through, then proceed cautiously when no other cars are passing., Pay attention to any other traffic signs and signals directed at vehicles before you cross a street. You should always proceed according to what’s going on around you, even when signs and signals indicate it’s safe.


Observe pedestrians closely when proceeding across the street. You might see signs in some areas that alert you to “PED XING” when there is a crosswalk you should be prepared to slow down and stop for.
Pay attention to other special signs at intersections that could affect the way you cross the street, like “Cross traffic does not stop” or markings on the road that indicate things like changing lanes or a bike lane to keep clear of.

"
"
Obey normal vehicle signs and signals.,
Stay in the bike lane if available.,
Proceed with caution to other drivers and pedestrians.",How to Cross the Street3," Follow the same rules that apply to drivers of motor vehicles when crossing any street. Obey any additional signs directed at bicycle riders.


This means that cyclists should follow green, yellow, and red lights as normal at a traffic light-controlled intersection, and observe right-of-way as normal at a stop light-controlled or uncontrolled intersection.
Pay attention to any signs directed at cyclists specifically. “Use Ped Signal” could indicate that you should cross according to the pedestrian lights rather than the vehicle traffic lights. “To request green, wait on ” shows you an area on which to position your bike to initiate a green light and cross the intersection., Keep riding in a bike lane or according to markings on the pavement that indicate where a cyclist should go when crossing the street. In the U.S., you’ll stay in the right lane or the right side of the roadway if there is no bike lane.


If there is no bike lane and the lane is wide enough, stay alongside cars in the traffic lane before crossing. If the lane is narrower, “take the lane” by positioning yourself in the middle of it so that no car can attempt to move next to you.Change lanes when it’s necessary to do so to proceed straight across the street or turn in the direction you wish to go. For instance, though you may be riding in the right lane, if it becomes a right-turn-only lane at an intersection and you need to proceed straight, you will shift over to the left until you are in a lane designated for straight-through traffic., Pay close attention to other vehicle drivers and pedestrians also present in an intersection before you cross. Be aware of your unique position as transportation that is faster than pedestrian but smaller and more vulnerable than motor vehicles.


Be aware that vehicle drivers in the U.S. may not see you on their right side, and can make maneuvers like clipping a corner on a right turn or merging lanes without noticing you, that can endanger you when crossing the street. Position yourself where drivers can see you as best as possible.Never try to weave in and out of lanes or vehicles. Only merge into a new lane when necessary to make a turn or other safety maneuver, and only after using hand signals appropriately.
Never cross a street from a sidewalk on a bike, as it will confuse and disrupt drivers and pedestrians. Dismount a bicycle and cross at a crosswalk only if it is safer or necessary to do so.

Stay calm.,
If the blown tire is on the rear end of the car, gradually slow down and pull to the side of the road.,
If the blown tire is on the front end (steering tires) you will most likely feel a very strong pull to the left or right (depending on which tire blew out).,
Begin to very gradually slow down (some recommend even allowing the car to coast to a stop), applying heavy braking will apply weight to the front end and could cause the car to swerve even if you were holding the wheel firmly.

,
Once the car has stopped, it's time to change the tire.

",How to Deal With a Tire Exploding While Driving," Avoid panic and stomping on the brakes.;

Choose your vehicle type; different types of vehicles will have a huge effect on the handling during certain maneuvers.,
Wheel-drive is a critical issue when a vehicle is driven.,
Examples of some of the best cars in each category.",How to Choose a Car for Tactical Driving," In general, smaller, lighter cars are best for maneuverability, but too small of a car may result in car with a weak engine.


Large vehicles (e.g.: SUVs, trucks, muscle cars) may get you horsepower and torque, but the weight of the vehicle will reduce acceleration and handling capabilities.
Tall vehicles (e.g.: SUVs and trucks) will tend to have worse body roll and slower suspension response than standard suspension setups on cars.
Lowered vehicles (i.e.: vehicles with body kits) have reduced ground clearance. While these might have benefits on the track or for aesthetic reasons, on standard roads with bumps, curbs, potholes, etc, reduced clearance can cause problems. Off-street usage (off-road) is greatly reduced or impractical as an emergency option.;
, It affects handling a great deal and performance as well; many shortcomings of certain wheel-drives can be overcome by the driver’s ability to compensate.


Front-wheel-drive (FWD)

This is the most common vehicle type in North America (almost all ""family sedans"" and minivans are FWD, as well as many SUVs (if AWD or 4WD is not an option on that specific vehicle).
Pros: FWD is the easiest car to drive in extreme situations. Generally, no fear of spin-outs (unless manually induced). Better traction in snow and ice than an equivalently weighted Rear Wheel Drive car.
Cons: Not the most efficient drive-type. Lots of squealing tires around corners, but not much speed. Bad under-steer while under power. Generally weaker vehicles use FWD for a minor weight savings, but also for additional safety with inexperienced drivers. Maximum of about 300BHP, before most power goes to waste below 40 mph (64 km/h) if a limited slip differential is present.


Rear wheel drive

Generally sports cars and SUVs with AWD or 4WD will be rear wheel drive. Some Japanese and European sedans will also be rear wheel drive, but this is more rare outside of their respective countries.
Pros: rear wheel drive vehicles are generally superior in acceleration to FWD vehicles. It also leaves you more manoeuvring options than a FWD. Maximum of about 800BHP, before most power goes to waste below 40 mph (64 km/h) if a limited slip differential is present.
Cons: These cars are a bit more difficult to handle under extreme situations. There is potential for a spin out while giving too much gas in a corner. More experience is required (more practice) to handle a rear wheel drive vehicle safely while trying to do it speedily.


All-wheel-drive (AWD, a.k.a. full-time four-wheel-drive)

This is the most rare outside of SUVs, but some sedans such as Volvo and Audi have AWD; Subaru's entire lineup is AWD.
Pros: Greatest stability in low-traction situations (e.g.: wet roads, dirt, snow, ice, gravel on road, off-road). AWD vehicles are able to put the most amount of power to the ground in and out of a corner. Easier to handle than a rear wheel drive vehicle. Reduced probability of a spin out. An AWD vehicle with an active center differential (usually only rally-bred cars) will behave with the best of all worlds. Maximum of about 1200BHP, before power goes to waste below 40 mph (64 km/h).
Cons: A transfer case (center differential), drive-line, and additional differential all add weight to the vehicle. Without an active center differential there is a great chance of severe under-steer. Most AWD vehicles (rally-bred cars are an exception) are FWD or rear wheel drive until one of those tires slip, at which time the other drive-line will activate, this may cause less predictable manoeuvrability.


Four-wheel-drive (4WD, AKA part-time four-wheel-drive)

This is often an option on SUVs and trucks. Some trucks like Dodges have auto-lockers which will allow 4WD to be activated on-the-fly (usually below 55MPH). But other vehicles may require a person to exit the vehicles and lock in the front two hubs. Many vehicles with AWD and 4WD will activate an open-differential to the normally un-powered tires.
4WD should only be activated while on very low-traction surfaces (e.g.: dirt, snow, ice, or off-road). If activated on asphalt, wind-up can occur and damage the transfer case or the differential (regardless if it is a locking differential).



, These are mainly based on balance in performance (i.e.: acceleration and handling).


FWD: (This is a hard choice) The 2006 Honda Civic Si, with its standard helical-type front-differential and almost 200BHP; and the 2007 Mazda Speed 3, with 18-inch wheels and 215/45 performance tires to adequately put its 263BHP to the road are both excellent choices.
Rear wheel drive: The BMW M3. This car has almost perfect front-rear wheel balance (51-49%), over 330BHP and is light and nimble.
AWD: Audi's sport model cars such as the S4, RS4, S5 and new R8 combine impressive horsepower numbers with track ready handling. Rally-bred cars such as the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution or Subaru Impreza WRX STI. Both are around 300BHP, have active or manual center differentials, and limited-slip differentials front and back. These vehicles give you great options as they are excellent on and off roads.
Tactical driving does not usually include 4WD trails, but possibly while on low-traction surfaces (and a vehicle with auto-lockers is involved) 4WD will give better traction and should be activated if possible. As for the best for tactical driving, an SUV would be superior to a truck in most cases, but something light, yet powerful would be good, such as a Jeep Cherokee or Wrangler. Nonetheless, a 4WD-bred vehicle is a poor-choice overall, if doing tactical driving on streets or even dirt roads.

Is your teenager abusing his/her new-found freedom?,
Do not EVER yell at, criticize, or lie to a teenager.,
DISCUSS the situation with them.",How to Cope With a Teen Driver," Different emotions, maybe, but not definitely. Know how they are feeling before blaming them.;
, If they are just learning to drive, they may be scared to be driving. If they are experienced at driving, maybe they are making plans to move out. Do they have a job? Are they paying for their own insurance?

, It's quite likely that they have TONS, and remember to keep the door open for future questions!

, Be tactful however. Don't yell at them and then tell them how to do something, rather show them how something has helped you.

, Is the price too high for you to handle? Why not suggest that they get a job. Tell them that driving is a privilege, and that if they want that privilege to continue, they have to be responsible and earn it through their work, just as an adult would have to. This will teach them budgeting skills for the future.

, Maybe your teenage driver could take a bit of your load! On the way to school, they can take their siblings to their school also. Just remember, if this is going to make the older child late for school/work, that this may not be an option. Do not put a burden on the young adult that they may not be able to handle.

, If not, this can obviously be a very difficult situation. See if you can help the teenager to get a job (if they do not already have one.) then, drive them to work for a few weeks (or months, if need be) so that they have enough money to get a car. Or, maybe you could get them a car, then they can drive themselves to work, and they can pay the monthly payments for the car. That would take the majority of the cost (aside from the down-payment) off of your shoulders, but would give the starting grounds for the teenager.

, Well, if they have their own car, pay for their insurance, and have a job, there isn't a TON you can do. However, you can assure them that bad behavior leads to bad ends. Are their grades low? Are they hanging out with the wrong people? Are they staying out too late? Discuss it with them. Driving is a privilege, a privilege that you can take away from them. Be ready to compromise your own standards. STICK TO IT! Give them a curfew if they are staying out too late. If they can stick to it for 2 months, then you give them an hour and a half later curfew. If they are hanging with the wrong crowd, tell them that you will be inquiring where they will be going for the next two months, and that you will be popping in whenever you feel like doing so. Are their grades low? Tell them that they will not be allowed to go out past X time until they get their grades up to your standards.

, If they get their licence the soonest possible, they will have only two more years that they have to spend with you, (in the US,) so if you upset them too much, what can you expect? They will just want to get out of there as soon as possible. And you don't want that, do you?

, Put a sticky note on their dashboard saying ""____, be at home at _:__ tonight, I need to talk to you. Love, Mom (or whatever title works).

Set up a schedule for checking the car.
,

When you first check your car, you should check the body.,

Check the tires before setting off.,

Start up the vehicle and take it for a quick ride.,

Smell for any exhaust.,

Once you've shut off the engine, pop the hood.,

Check the engine oil.,

Check the engine coolant.,

Check the windshield washer fluid.,

If you're leaving your car for some time, release the handbrake (parking brake) and chock the wheels.,

Close everything up, lock the doors, and check back again in a week!
",How to Check Your Unused Vehicle's Condition,", Look for rust spots and any vandalism. Take action if anything looks to be serious., Look for any crazing or cracking, and feel around the sides of the tyre for lumps or bulges. If you find any of these, the tyre should be replaced for safety. Check the tyre pressures before driving off, with a good quality (preferably electronic) gauge. Don't take a quick trip to the gas station to check pressures with their inaccurate and/or abused station gauges - it's not worth it. Don't check your pressures after driving as your tires, and the air inside them, will warm up. This will give a false reading. If the pressures are lower than recommended, you'll need to fill them. Under-inflated tyres will reduce your MPG, will wear quicker and can catastrophically part company with the wheel rim., Be sure to take a few left and right turns, make a few stops to check the brakes, and keep the radio off so you can listen to any sounds that aren't normal. Make sure the engine temperature reaches its normal position on the gauge., If it smells funny, or is strong, you should have it checked. There could be a leak in the exhaust somewhere., Let the engine cool a few minutes by checking the tire pressure., Pull out the dipstick and wipe it off on a paper towel. The oil should be a brown color. Avoid letting it get black. Replace the dipstick and pull it back out and check the oil level. If it is a quart low, add more oil, but keep an eye on how often you need to add oil. If it's fairly often, you may have a leak., This should remain constant at its ""full"" level. If it's any lower, add more and keep a close eye on its progress. Once again, frequent refills could indicate a leak., This doesn't have to be full, but you should avoid letting it run completely empty., This will avoid the brakes seizing on. If you're leaving the car for a very long time (months), jack up the car and support it on axle stands. This stops the tyres from cracking.,"

Decide on your route ahead of time.,
Adjust your car’s controls beforehand.,
Fasten children and pets.",How to Avoid Distractions While Driving1," Give yourself enough time in the morning to dress, shave, and apply makeup. If you need to, wake up 15 to 30 minutes early to make sure you are dressed and groomed before stepping out the door. This way you can avoid having to do these things while driving.If you don’t have enough time in the morning to finish getting ready, then bring your grooming supplies with you in the car. Wait until you arrive at your destination and your car is parked before finishing your grooming routine.;
, Before you start the car, make sure to store loose objects that can roll around and distract you while you are driving. Place them in the trunk, a secure bag, or in your glove compartment. This way you can avoid reaching for these objects in the car if they get loose, which can be dangerous.For example, place grooming supplies, clothes and shoes, books, and bags in the trunk or glove compartment.

, While sitting in your parked car, confirm and familiarize yourself with the route you will be taking. Also check the traffic report while you are confirming your route. This way, you can avoid having to re-route your GPS while driving.If you are using a GPS, make sure it is set up before you begin driving, and use the voice function so you do not have to glance at your GPS.

, Make sure to adjust the climate controls to the correct setting. Also set your radio to the station you want to listen to and adjust the volume while your car is parked.Additionally, make sure to adjust your mirrors, seat, and steering wheel to the correct positions beforehand.

, Before you take off, make sure your children are fastened in their car seats or seatbelts. Also make sure your pets are in a cage and the cage is secured with a seatbelt. By doing this, you can avoid having to reach back to adjust your child’s car seat, or your pet’s cage while you are driving.When driving with animals in the car, always make sure they are secured in a cage.

Choose a licensed driver.,
Select a driver randomly.,
Make sure that you have enough drivers for the group.,
Share the responsibility.",How to Choose a Designated Driver1," Although it sounds like common sense, you should choose a designated driver that has a valid driver’s license. Don’t rely on someone who has had their license revoked or only has a learner’s permit.


Ask the driver about their driving record if you have any questions about their age or driving eligibility.;
, If you are going out for drinks with a group of friends, you can decide who will be the designated driver using a random selection process. This will ensure that the selection process is fair. However, do try to switch things up - if someone was the designated driver last time, don't let them be designated driver this time.


Try random selection methods such as drawing names out of a hat.

, It is important to have enough seats in the vehicle for each member in your group. If the designated driver does not have enough seats in their car to safely transport each member, you should select another designated driver. Each person should have their own seatbelt.

, Unless you have one friend who enjoys being the designated driver, be polite and share this responsibility with your friends. Set up a rotation or schedule with your friends to help share the responsibility of being the designated driver. When it is your turn to be the designated driver, be responsible and reliable.If someone offers you a drink when you are the designated driver be sure to inform them that you are serving as your group’s designated driver. Say something like, “I won’t be drinking tonight since I am serving as the designated driver for my friends.”

Slow down gradually.,
Move to an outside lane (not the shoulder) and allow faster traffic to pass.,
Find alternate routes.",How to Avoid Tailgaters1," If you are travelling at the speed limit, or going with the flow, slow down slightly and look for the first opportunity to move out of the way of the tailgater so they can pass you safely. The only place where you want a tailgater to be is in front of you. If you are on a two-lane road where passing is permissible and you're already going as fast as you are comfortable going, slow down and encourage the tailgater to pass. Waving someone forward to pass you is generally considered acceptable on country roads.
If you slow down gradually, the tailgater will respond by slowing down as well. This way if something unexpected happens in the road, and the tailgater hits you, the accident will be much less severe because the momentum will be lower and they will hit you with much less force.;
, In most places, faster traffic moves in the inner lanes (the ""fast lanes"") and slower traffic in the outer lanes (the ""slow lanes""). Moving to this lane will also give you a chance to pull off onto the shoulder (if one is available) in case you need to pull out of traffic completely.However, if you pull off the road and the tailgater does the same, pull back on the road and find a populated area (like a shopping mall or a rest area) to pull off at. People have been robbed because they were hit by a tailgater and pulled off in the middle of nowhere. Always be cautious and safe when pulling off of the roadway.

, If you notice that the route you take to get wherever you're going is a constant source for tailgating or other road rage, it might be safer to find another way to go, not to mention much less stressful.Try taking city streets instead of congested highways when possible. Tailgating is more common on busy highway roads and interstates where people can drive at faster speeds.

Refrain from eating while driving.,
Turn off your cellphone.,
Pull over on the side of the road.",How to Avoid Distractions While Driving2," Because food spills are major sources of distraction while driving, try to avoid eating in the car, especially messy foods. Instead, eat before you get in the car, or eat once you have reached your destination.Make sure to place drinks, like coffee, water, and sodas, in secure drink holders while driving to avoid spills.

, Cellphones are also a major source of distraction for drivers. Either place your cellphone on silent, turn it off, or place it out of reach in your purse or the glove compartment. Additionally, look into your phone’s safety settings. See if you can create a message that will automatically respond to incoming texts and calls while you drive.Some phones have features that turn off text and call functions while the GPS is on.

, Do this if there is an emergency and you need to take a call. If you have to eat while driving, make sure to pull over to eat as well. Additionally, if you need to attend to children and pets while driving, then pull over.If you are on the highway or a busy street, make sure to exit before pulling over. Then make your way to a street that is less busy.

Limit the number of passengers.,
Use your passengers wisely.,
Save serious conversations for later.",How to Avoid Distractions While Driving3," Try to avoid driving with too many passengers, especially if you are a new driver. Loud or talkative passengers can be a distraction in and of themselves. So try to drive with only one or two people at a time.For young drivers, the risk of being in a crash triples when they are driving with passengers who are their peers versus driving alone., When you do have someone in the car with you, let them control the music, GPS, and the climate controls. You can also let them answer your texts or phone calls while you are driving. This will not only help you focus on the road, but it will also give your passengers something to do instead of distracting you. Let your passengers know ahead of time what their role is while you drive.For example, “Ok, Kevin, since you are in the passenger’s seat, your main job is to adjust the controls and GPS, as well as answer texts and calls so I can focus on driving.”

, Serious or stressful conversations can get emotional. When your emotions are running high, it is more difficult to focus on the task at hand, in this case driving. Let your passenger know that you would like to talk, but that you would rather do it later when you are not driving. This way you can focus on driving, and give the conversation your full attention when the time is right.You can say for example, “I would like to talk about this with you, but right now is not a good time since I am driving. Let’s wait until we arrive at our destination to talk.”
If things start to get heated, then pull the car over in a safe place to diffuse the situation.

Avoid rubbernecking at accident scenes.,
Avoid looking directly into the headlights of oncoming traffic.,
Keep your windshield clean.,
Ignore angry drivers.,
Pull over to look at scenery.",How to Avoid Distractions While Driving4," When approaching a car accident, it is a common mistake to slow down or stop to check out the damage. But this kind of behavior can cause more accidents. Instead, keep your eyes on the road ahead of you and drive at a reduced speed., Do this when you are driving at night. The headlights of oncoming traffic can temporarily blind you and make you feel disoriented. Instead, avert your eyes by looking down and to the right until the car passes.You will still be able to see other cars around you with your peripheral vision.

, Clean the inside and outside of your windshield with windshield cleaner on a regular basis (about once or twice a month). Cleaning your windshield on a regular basis can help to reduce sun glare, which can be a distraction in and of itself.You can also reduce sun glare by using your visors and wearing sunglasses when it is very sunny outside.

, When other drivers honk at you, cut you off, or make inappropriate faces or gestures, try to avoid returning the behavior. Instead, simply ignore them and carry on driving., If you are on a scenic road trip, make sure to pull over in a safe place to check out the scenery. Checking out the scenery while you are driving is a major distraction that could cause you to get into an accident."

Select your designated driver before you begin drinking.,
Confirm that the driver will not consume alcohol.,
Give the keys to the driver before anyone drinks.",How to Choose a Designated Driver2," Avoid deciding that your group will need a designated driver after the first round of drinks. It is very dangerous to decide who will be the designated driver based off of the person who is the least drunk or has had the least to drink., It is wise for the designated driver to remain sober the entire night. Although it is legal to drive with a blood alcohol content of .08, unless you have an accurate breathalyzer, it is wise for the designated driver to completely refrain from drinking., To avoid any disagreements or fights while you are intoxicated, give your keys to your designated driver before you start drinking. Instruct the designated driver to not return your keys to you until you are sober, even if you adamantly request them."
"
Call a taxi.,
Use public transportation.,
Make use of designated driver programs.,
Have a designated friend or family member on speed dial.",How to Choose a Designated Driver3," Sometimes your plan does not work out the way you planned it. In that case it is wise to have a backup plan. Taking a taxi or an Uber is a good way to avoid drinking if you have had too much to drink and don’t have a safe way home.Call a cab when your designated driver has also had too much to drink or has left the party.
Call a cab when you are alone and have not designated a driver to get you home.

, If a taxi is too expensive consider taking the bus or train to get home safely. Use caution if you are using public transportation while you are intoxicated. Try to be aware of your surroundings and travel with at least one other person., In some larger cities, there are designated driver services that can get both you and your car home. Some non-profit organizations and for-profit companies will offer designated driver services during peak drinking times, such as New Year’s Eve.Remember to tip your driver as many of them are volunteers.
Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have designated driver services available in each county.
Dryver is a designated driver service that provides a website and app to help you find a designated driver.

, Make an agreement with a friend or family member that you can trust to pick you up when you need them to. Make sure that this person is reliable and responsible and won’t pick you up when they are intoxicated themselves."

Never pump your brakes at a tailgater.,
Make a turn to get away from the tailgater.,
Stay in the right-hand lane.",How to Avoid Tailgaters2," Even though it may seem logical to you to make an attempt to tell the tailgater they are too close to you, don’t do this. The tailgater already knows they’re too close. They just don’t care. If you pump your brakes, the tailgater will become desensitized to your braking and might hit you if you suddenly had to stop.Pumping your brakes at a tailgater may also make them angry and cause them to react in a negative or violent way toward you.

, If someone is really tailgating you and you feel unsafe, take the first right turn you can. Resume your route when the impatient motorist has passed. Getting out of the way may be the easiest way to get yourself out of the situation and back to safety.If you are being followed closely by a vehicle and, when you turn off the road the car still follows you, never drive to your home or any personally identifiable location. Continue onward and drive around the block. Odds are good that it was a mere coincidence, but if the vehicle continues to follow you after several random turns, drive to the nearest police station or contact the police with a cellular phone if you have one available.

, If you are not driving faster than most of the cars around you, stay in the right lane at all times. Since the left lane is intended only for passing slower vehicles, cars traveling faster tend to be in the left lane more often. This means that you are more likely to encounter someone tailgating you (and getting angry about your slower speed) if you are driving in the left-hand lane.Only use the left lane for passing. Get around the car you’re passing and get back over into the right lane as quickly and safely as possible.

Be aware of your surroundings.,
Be mindful of the speed limit.,
Signal ahead of time.,
Avoid rush hour traffic.,
Be more cautious at night.,
Drive carefully in inclement weather.",How to Avoid Tailgaters3," Watch for changes in road conditions, changes in speed, debris on the road, and the behavior or other drivers on the road. These things can be distracting and often cause accidents, or at least erratic driving, which can incite tailgaters to start following you more closely.


Pay attention to the items in your car to reduce distractions while driving. If you are distracted by what’s happening inside your car rather than focusing on the road, you will be a less safe driver to those around you.
Pulling out in front of someone else (especially if they happen to be a habitual tailgater) can be a dangerous mistake. It may upset a tailgater and cause them to act irrationally.

, One way to drive defensively and avoid tailgating is to pay close attention to the posted speed limit. Make sure that you are driving with the flow of traffic, but also that you are not going too fast or too slow for the posted speed zone.Tailgating accidents often happen when people are driving too slow for the situation (significantly under the posted speed limit or going slower than the flow of traffic).

, One way to avoid accidents caused by tailgating is to signal with plenty of advance warning. If you tell a tailgater (by using your blinker) that you intend to change lanes, they will probably avoid zooming around you in the other lane.This will help protect you from tailgaters who may come up behind you very quickly.

, Try to avoid driving during rush hours – typically 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. (morning rush), 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (lunch rush), and 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 PM (evening rush). Rush hours typically happen during the weekdays. While this may not leave a lot of room to conduct daily business, particularly if you stay at home during the day, these are times when motorists are most often on the roads and in a hurry to get to work (or wherever else they are going) on time.Also consider avoiding using highways, interstates, or other high-speed thoroughfares for short trips. Tailgating often happens on roads with high speed limits.

, Because of the limited visibility, it is important to be extra vigilant when you are driving at nighttime. Speed limits are often lower at night, so pay attention to that as well.


Tailgaters are particularly hazardous at night because of the bright headlights and what a distraction this can be while driving at night. If you have a tailgater following too closely at night, try to get away from them and out of their headlights.

, Tailgating is particularly dangerous during poor weather conditions because the roads may not be in the best shape for sudden stops. Always be mindful of road conditions when you are driving.


If you are driving on icy or slick roads, breaking quickly could cause you to slip and slide and lose control of your vehicle. If a tailgater does this, they probably won’t have enough time to react before hitting you with their car.

Take a road rage self-test.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Avoid Road Rage1," Making your car a happy, peaceful place will help keep your road anger at bay. Listen to music that makes you happy or that calms you down. Creating a positive driving environment will help keep you calm during your commute and aid you in ignoring the road rage of others.Listening to audio books is one good way to remain calm during a long commute.;
, Being late will make you anxious and impatient, so you'll be more likely to get angry at other drivers or make irresponsible driving decisions that will make them angry at you. Leaving yourself plenty of drive time will help you stay relaxed., If you begin to clench the steering wheel while driving, wiggle your fingers and then try to hold the wheel with a more relaxed grip. You will retain control of the car, while feeling less tense., If your vehicle has cruise control and road conditions will allow it, using this feature will give your right leg a break and may make you feel less stressed.You should only use cruise control in situations where you can drive safely at the same speed for extended periods of time – use manual control in stop-and-go traffic situations.

, If you feel yourself getting tense and anxious, take several slow, deep breaths. This should calm you down. Roll your window down every now and then, to let in some fresh air., Whether you are consciously aware of it or not, clutter can cause stressful feelings. Trying to see through a dirty windshield, or struggling to clean a dirty windshield with the wiper fluid every few minutes, will also cause you feel anxious and tense – feelings which can quickly lead to road rage., It's a good idea to pull over if you are feeling symptoms of road rage. Find a safe place to pull over and park, then get out and walk around for a few minutes until you feel more calm.Never try to pull over on the side of a busy street or highway – continue to the next exit, then find a safe place to stop the car.
Try not to drive more than 3 hours at a time. If you are on a long road trip, take a break at least every 3 hours and pull over to stretch your legs.

, If construction zones or rush hour highway traffic tend to make you edgy and more likely to express your road rage, find another way to get where you need to go. Use an online mapping system to look at alternate routes using calmer back roads that will make you less likely to get angry while driving., Doctors generally recommend that adults get about 8 hours of sleep per night. If you are sleeping less than this, the accumulated sleep loss will seriously affect your mood. Being tired can lead to anger, resentment, and annoyance, all of which contribute to road rage., You're not trying to “win” anything when you are behind the wheel – you're trying to get where you're going, safely. Don't allow yourself to get drawn into contests with other drivers who want to race, or who dodge in and out of lanes trying to pass you.Some people enjoy passing you and then slowing down, for mysterious passive-aggressive reasons of their own. If possible, slow down enough to get behind a different car. Keep your distance from any driver who seems to be ""playing games” with you.

, Don't talk on the phone, text message, eat, or apply lipstick while driving. This could cause you to be caught off guard by other drivers' actions, fueling your road rage and causing a dangerous incident., If you find yourself continually battling feelings of road rage, you may need to consider taking a different job or moving closer to your job, to shorten your commute. A high salary will not offset the unhappiness caused by spending too much time on the road, when you could be spending with family and friends, or engaging in activities you enjoy., To find out whether your driving style is considered aggressive, take an online self-test. Being aware of your own tendencies toward road rage may make you more aware of the need to control it., Some doctors believe that a condition known as Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is responsible for road rage in certain people. Speak to your doctor if you continually experience feelings of anger or aggression, or have difficulty controlling your temper or your behavior.IED may contribute to other factors such as depression, substance abuse, anxiety, and a difficulty maintaining healthy relationships.
Your doctor may suggest therapy or medication to help control IED symptoms.

Avoid eye contact.,
Avoid escalation.,
Remember that it's nothing personal.,
Stay safe.",How to Avoid Road Rage2," Although it can be difficult not to react when someone is shouting at you, the best thing to do is ignore it. Keep your eyes on the road, and try not to make eye contact with the enraged driver., If an angry driver yells at you or shares a rude gesture out his or her window, don't shout back at them. Continue to drive as safely as possible ignore the angry driver. Fighting and driving angry is dangerous to both of you as well as the other drivers and will only cause the situation to escalate.Roughly half of US drivers reported responding to an enraged driver by yelling back or making a rude gesture.
As many as 37% of road rage incidents involve a firearm. This alone is an excellent reason to avoid road rage escalation.

, If another driver cuts you off or honks at you, it's because they're experiencing their own road rage, not because they are angry at you. Don't let it ruin your commute. Taking offense at his or her action will only cause your own road rage to escalate.

, If you do become a victim of another driver's road rage and you feel threatened, take steps to keep yourself safe. Note the license plate number, make, and model of the vehicle in case the situation escalates and there is vehicle damage. If you're being followed, drive to the nearest police station and request assistance."

Be a polite driver.,
Put your phone away.,
Use your turn signals.,
Check your blind spots.,
Lay off the horn.,
Be aware of your high beams.,
Resist the urge to brake sharply as a warning.",How to Avoid Road Rage3," Allow other drivers to pass you or get over into your lane if needed. Being courteous puts everyone in a more stable state of mind.

, Talking or texting while driving is a terrible distraction that often causes accidents. Road rage can be triggered if an angry driver spots you using your phone in the car.Cell phone usage causes more than 25% of auto accidents in the US.
13 US states and D.C. have laws prohibiting hand-held phone use while driving: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.
Talking on a hand-held phone is also illegal in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands.
37 states and D.C. ban phone use while driving for novice drivers (drivers under a specified age – anywhere from 16 to 20, depending on the state).
Texting while driving is even more dangerous than talking on the phone. If you're driving 55 mph and take your eyes off the road for 5 seconds to read a text, that's the equivalent of driving the entire length of a football field, while blindfolded.

, Any time you plan to make a turn or change lanes, use your turn signal. It can be extremely frightening when someone suddenly cuts into the lane ahead of you, without warning you first. This is a major road rage trigger for some people., Twice. When changing lanes, especially at interstate highway speeds, be sure to look behind you and check any blind spots to make sure you aren't going to accidentally cut somebody off. Slotting into a lane carelessly and forcing the driver in that lane to slam on the brakes can easily spark road rage., Excessive honking is a road rage trigger for many people, and it's just generally a rude thing to do. Your horn should only be used in rare situations when you need to alert another driver of your presence.Use your horn if another driver doesn't seem to see you while backing out of a parking space.
Use your horn to alert another driver that your lane is occupied, if it looks like they are about to swerve into you.
Do not use your horn because you're tired of sitting still in a traffic jam. Everyone else is equally annoyed, and using your horn will only make people angry. It won't alleviate the traffic.
Do not use your horn to punish the driver in front of you if they don't immediately move when the light turns green. (If they continue to sit still, you can honk. Just try not to be obnoxious about it.)

, When it's dark out and you're using your high beams for increased visibility, always remember to switch over to regular beams when you spot an oncoming car. Being blinded by an inconsiderate person's high beams on a dark, deserted road is a recipe for road rage., When the car behind you is following too closely, don't slam on the brakes to “wake them up.” This often leads to a rear-end collision. Even tapping your brakes lightly, hoping the other driver will take the hint, can lead to a crash. Using your 4-way hazards when someone's narrowing the distance behind you, or if you see traffic slowing ahead is safer than using your brakes right away, as you are alerting everyone behind you. When you are being tailgated (followed too closely for safety), move to a different lane if possible.
If you can't change lanes, slow down gradually and allow the driver behind to pass you.

, You should always be looking ahead, anticipating cars braking and people crossing the road. Ideally, you should be aware of what's going on up to 15 to 20 seconds ahead of you so you can respond accordingly and safely.

, With text messaging becoming so popular, many states are making it illegal to text while driving so as to avoid driving accidents. If you are afraid you may be tempted, put your phone away. Consider investing in a Bluetooth so you can use the phone hands-free. Don't be distracted by children. Explain that they need to stay quiet while driving. The sooner they understand safe driving, the better. If children become unruly, pull the car over when it is safe and deal with them.

, You should be able to see the back tires of the car in front of you touching the road.

, If you are forced to get on the road, drive slowly, brake sooner, and increase the distance between you and the driver in front.

, It is safer to just let obnoxious drivers pass on by. Getting aggravated will only negatively impact your driving and possibly cause a car accident.

, When safe, look over your shoulder and confirm that it is clear for you to make your move.

, And always use your signals so other drivers know what you are doing.

, Check your tire pressure, wipers, wiper fluid, lights, and brakes often, but especially before heading out on long journeys. Always keep your inspections up to date."

Don't be tempted to “teach them a lesson” – it won't work.









In general, avoid the left lane. It’s where most accidents happen.You also have more ""escape routes"" in the right lane should a problem suddenly arise that requires you to quickly change lanes or pull onto the shoulder.

, Two hands on the wheel allow you more control over the car if an emergency situation were to arise. Imagine having one hand leisurely resting on it when you have to swerve out of the way – you lose that precious split second in adjusting your position that could mean the difference between safety and an accident.


Keep your hands in the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions. While this isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, this position does allow you the most flexibility should you suddenly need to adjust your course., No matter how slowly traffic is moving, keep at least two seconds of following distance between you and the car ahead of you. Any less and you won't be able to stop in time if the driver in front of you slams on their brakes.









This is especially important during high traffic times. You may think the car ahead of you is speeding up significantly, when really they’re moving forward only to stop again. If you don’t tailgate, you’ll put less wear on your brakes and save gas, too. All that stopping and starting isn’t good for your vehicle.

, Always use your signal, even if you think no one is there. When changing lanes on the freeway, don't signal as an afterthought or during the lane change. Signal at least a couple of seconds in advance so others know what you're going to do before you do it and can account for your actions should there be an issue.









Ever notice how most of the skid marks along the highway are just before an exit ramp? This is where you have to be the most careful.

, Don't get in the habit of staring at the back of the car ahead of you. Periodically shift your eyes to the side-view mirrors, the rear-view mirror, and ahead to where you'll be in 10-15 seconds. Doing this, you can spot a potentially dangerous situation before it happens.









This can help you predict what traffic is going to do. Looking at the cars a few ahead of you will let you know whether you’ll have to soon hit the brakes or not.
This will help you monitor your blind spot as well, which makes it much easier to know if the lane changes you want to make are safe.

, This is a must, no matter where you are, what kind of car you're driving, or where you're driving to. By law in many countries, all cars must have a safety restraint and it must be used. Buckling up only takes a second and can save your life in an accident.









Children should always be in a booster seat or car seat until they are tall enough and heavy enough to sit by themselves. This generally includes children age eight and under.Never put a child in a car or booster seat in the front passenger seat or another seat with airbags. Children should generally be 12 and older when sitting in the front passenger seat.



, Staying within the protection of the curbside lane will reduce the likelihood of a collision with oncoming traffic in two- or four-lane city streets. And instead of having traffic on both sides of your vehicle, as you have when you are in the non-curbside lane, you only have traffic on one side, which lessens the probability that another driver will hit your vehicle in one way or another., Many minor car accidents occur in parking lots, mostly when either parking or leaving the parking space. If you park in a space without vehicles in the spaces to either side of you, this potentially gives several other cars the chance to hit your vehicle while attempting to park next to it. If you park between two other vehicles, you reduce the chance that other cars will attempt to park next to yours and possibly hit it., Pull over if you need to talk on the phone, read directions, eat a snack, or mess with your iPod or CD player. It only takes a second or two of distraction to get into trouble, to miss that obstacle in the middle of the road or the car in front of you coming to a jarring halt. The last thing you want is your mind and hands busy when an emergency situation arises.





This is important to keep yourself accountable, but it's also important to keep away from others that aren't so careful. Giving driving 100% of your concentration will help you avoid the drivers that are texting, eating, or not really paying active attention.

, Most accidents happen at night or in the wee hours of the morning. Here’s why:It is more difficult to see, regardless of the weather.
You and other drivers are more tired. Your reaction times are slower, making driving overall more dangerous.
You will have the greatest chance of meeting up with a drunk driver at night.

, If your eyes are on your phone or your thoughts are anywhere else other than on the road, you’re more likely to get into an accident.


Approximately one-quarter of all traffic accidents are related to cell phone use in America.That's 25% – or 1.3 million crashes.

, Inclement weather – be it fog, the wind, rain, or snow – means your car can’t perform as normal and neither can the cars around you (regardless of how good a driver you are or those around you are). And even if no one is around you, you still run the risk of having a weather-related accident. Here's a few things to keep in mind:









Always keep your windshield wipers going in the rain or snow
Defrost your windshield to keep it from fogging up
Turn on your headlights to help others to see you
If possible, try to avoid driving in the snow at all, especially if your car is rear wheel drive. If you must go out in the snow, drive extra slow, use the brakes and gas pedal gently, and maintain an increased stopping distance.

, It is always best to have a ""designated driver.” If someone you're with wants to drive and they've been drinking, don't let them. There are taxis, public transit, and people you can call for assistance. There is no reason to drive when alcohol is on the scene.









Never drive after you have had alcoholic beverages either. Even one beer can alter your ability to drive safely. After all, buzzed driving is drunk driving, especially to the cops.

, When you're tired (especially if you fall asleep easily or have narcolepsy), your reaction time is impaired. Your brain isn't firing on all cylinders and you drive on autopilot, unable to take in all the stimuli around you. When that happens, you are more likely to put yourself in a dangerous situation without even realizing it.


Be aware that some medications can cause drowsiness and make operating a vehicle very dangerous.If you've started a new medication, ask your doctor if it is still safe to drive.

, These vehicles (primarily Fire Department vehicles and ambulances) can override the normal pattern of traffic signals in some circumstances. Even if your light is green, you shouldn't go. Some cities have the technology to turn your light red, but others don't. If you're in a situation where you're moving forward, move to the right onto the shoulder to let them pass.


Both the emergency vehicle and the traffic signal must be equipped with the appropriate devices, and only some cities and certain intersections have such devices installed. One of the most common is the ""Opticom"" system, basically recognized as a very fast flashing white strobe light mounted at or near the top of the emergency vehicle (not the ""wig-wag"" flashing high-beam headlights). A small receiving unit mounted on the traffic signal pole receives the ""strobe code"" and turns traffic lights green for the approaching emergency vehicle and red in all other directions. Such systems have been shown to reduce traffic accidents and injuries/fatalities involving emergency vehicles while improving response times to life-threatening emergencies.
Emergency vehicles can only take control of intersection traffic lights if they are traveling in an emergency response mode – with all emergency lights activated and siren sounding. Once the emergency vehicle travels through the intersection, the traffic signal returns to its normal pattern.

, According to a recent study, five percent of all vehicles experience tire problems immediately before a crash. Tires that are underinflated by more than 25 percent are three times more likely to be involved in a crash related to tire problems than vehicles with proper inflation.


What’s more, tires underinflated up to 25 percent run the risk of overheating, leading to failure, and at the very least adversely affecting handling and tread life.

, When your car is in tiptop shape, the likelihood of you getting into an accident due to a technical malfunction is greatly reduced. You can't prevent the weather, but you can prevent your car from causing your next accident.









Get your brakes checked. A surefire way to get into an accident is to have your brakes go out on you. Get your brake lining checked by your mechanic the next time you’re in for a tune-up.

, Simply enough, to avoid accidents, you’ve got to be able to see. With your vision even slightly impaired, you could lose that split second you need to adjust your course and put yourself in danger.


Keep the mirrors positioned well, too. If you can’t see what’s behind you, next to you, or in your blind spot, you’re much, much more likely to get into a car accident.

, In the event that you run into bad weather (snow or rain), it’s imperative that your windshield wipers work well. If they don’t, you won’t be able to see out of your car and properly determine what’s in front of you and how far away it is. The accident you could get you might not even see coming.


You can do this yourself quite easily. Read wikiHow's How to Change the Wiper Blades on Your Car for more information.

Look for signs of an inductive loop detector.,
Check for camera detection.,
Consider that the lights could be fixed time operated.",How to Trigger Green Traffic Lights1," As you pull up to an intersection, look for markings in the roadway that indicate an inductive loop that has been installed below the surface to detect the conductive metal in cars, bikes, and motorcycles.


Once a vehicle is detected by the loops, the traffic light system is signaled that there is someone waiting to proceed. The lights for the cross traffic will then begin to change after a safe time period before the light turns green for you.
Check for signs of loop detectors in the pavement just before the stop line and crosswalk markings. You will often be able to see grooves in the pavement where the loop has been installed, indicating where you should position your vehicle.
There are several different shapes of inductive loops, including a dipole (one loop with two long sides), quadrupole (two loops with three long sides), and diagonal quadrupole (two loops with four long sides, designed to detect two-wheeled vehicles more easily).;
, Look out for cameras at intersections, which can detect the presence of cars waiting and signal the lights to begin changing.


Find cameras of this type mounted to posts and beams at the intersection, near the traffic lights themselves.
These cameras can also be used to take photos of illegal traffic activity, or they may perform both functions.

, Know that some traffic lights change based on a predetermined timer only, and cannot be specifically triggered to change by the presence of a vehicle.


These fixed time lights would likely be found in an area with equally heavy traffic coming from both sides, or in a town or city that simply doesn’t have the infrastructure for an actuated system.
Note that while this type of traffic light is pre-determined and scheduled by traffic control engineers, it is typically regularly updated based on actual usage, and even adjusted to take into account holidays, big events, and other potential variations in traffic."

Plan your driving, for example you may choose to take a longer route but one with less traffic or is technically easier to travel.

,
Keep your vehicle slower than the speed limits at turns or steep roads.",How to Avoid a Car Accident," These are the simple ways to check that your car has no problem.;
, We all think we're great drivers, and some of us are, but there are other people on the road too. Remember not to stare at anything for too long. Be aware of your surroundings and make sure you are aware of what's happening on every side of your car. Constantly check your rear-view mirror and try to judge every cars speed. Knowing where everyone is and how they drive will help you decide who to stay away from and where to go when the time calls for it.

, There are side-streets and parking areas where people can just pull out without noticing. Checking your blind spots before you move in the next lane always helps avoids side-swiping accidents.

, Pull ahead of them or behind for a brief moment to show them that you are still there, just in case they don't check their blind spots.

, Not everyone pays attention!

, Remember that emergency vehicles sometimes have to drive through red lights or against the normal direction of traffic!

, When you use the signal lights, you are also warning everyone that you want to change your lanes. They may slow down or stop the car until you pass the road.

, Most people have accidents because they don't follow the laws. The laws may not align with your idea of how to drive, but they are there to keep you and the people around you safe.

, When you push the brake, it takes a few seconds to stop the car because of the time it takes to think, react and push the brake. The safe distance depends on the speed. When you push the brake, you also can slide a little distance, so we must keep a safe distance. Remember, more speed/more distance.

,, You never know what is going to come from the other side.

Stay alert.,
Follow the speed limit.,
Pay attention to traffic signs.,
Use your turn signals properly.,
Let aggressive drivers pass you up.,
Maintain a three second cushion between you and other cars.,
Avoid construction zones.,
Use caution during poor weather conditions.",How to Avoid Accidents While Driving1," In addition to keeping your eyes on the road, stay alert by checking your rear view and side mirrors often. Check for speeding cars or cars that are driving too close to you. Also, be aware of your blind spots and make sure to check them before switching lanes.Make sure to watch for kids and animals, especially in parking lots and residential areas.;
, Speed limits are generally posted every three to five miles. Make sure to watch for speed limits signs and adjust your speed accordingly. If you do not know the speed limit, then limit your speed to 30 mph (48 kph) if you are driving on the street and 60 mph (96 kph) if you are driving on the highway.Remember that the faster you drive, the less reaction time you have to avoid accidents.

, Watch for traffic lights, pedestrian crossing, school zone, and stop signs. Additionally, heed warning signs such as merging traffic, winding road, and sharp turn ahead, to name a few. This way you can avoid potential collisions, as well as traffic tickets., Turn your signal on at least a block (100 feet/30 meters) before making a turn. This way, the other cars behind you will have enough time to slow their speed or switch lanes before you make your turn.Additionally, make sure to turn your signal off after you have turned or switched lanes so you can avoid confusing other cars.

, Aggressive drivers will speed, honk, tailgate, and cut you off. The best thing to do in this situation is to slow down and let them pass you or go around you. The idea is to create distance between you and an aggressive driver.The more distance there is between you and an aggressive driver, the safer you will be.

, This way, you will have enough time to react if something goes wrong, like a tire blowout. Additionally, by giving yourself enough time to get to the places you need to go, you can avoid having to speed and tailgate other cars., If you know that an area on your way to work or school is under construction, then try to find an alternate route until the construction is complete. If construction zones are unavoidable, then make sure to drive the speed limit and pay attention to other road signs, like detour signs, to avoid accidents.The speed limits in construction zones are dramatically reduced for you and the workers' safety. Make sure to pay attention to these signs to avoid accidents and traffic tickets.

, Rain, snow, fog, sleet, high winds, and other poor weather conditions can increase your chances of an accident. Therefore, make sure to drive slowly, turn your headlights on, and increase the distance between you and other cars to avoid accidents.Keep both hands on the wheel and limit lane changes, i.e., stay in one lane.
Make sure your car is equipped to deal with poor weather conditions; for example, make sure your windshield wipers and headlights work properly.

Pull up to the stop line in a car.,
Position a bike or motorcycle at the correct spot.,
Initiate a crosswalk button as a pedestrian.",How to Trigger Green Traffic Lights2," Drive your car up the stop bar or line, which is a line perpendicular to your car painted just in front of the crosswalk markings at most intersections.


If you see grooves in the road that indicate the presence of inductive loops, make sure your car is positioned directly over those loops so it gets detected.
If you see no signs of inductive loops, or you see a camera control system, just make sure that you are positioned in the middle of the street lane, not further forward than the stop line and not too far back from it.
It’s especially important to position your car not too far forward or backward when in a left turning lane, as these often will have their own detector that signals a protected left turn signal.

, Note that those with bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles sometimes have difficulty triggering traffic light detectors due to the smaller profile of a two-wheel vehicle. Be extra careful to position yourself in line with a given detector.


On a street with markings that indicate a dipole (one loop), position both bike wheels directly over either the right or left side of the loop. For a quadripole (two loops), position the wheels over the middle line where the two loops connect. For a diagonal quadripole, position yourself anywhere over the markings.Some intersections may have markings directly on the roadway that indicate a line on which cyclists should place the wheels of their bikes. Often there will be a nearby sign with the same symbol as on the pavement, indicating “To request green, wait on .”If there is a camera installed for detection, simply make sure your bike or motorcycle is positioned in the center of the lane, or lean it toward the middle of the lane from one side. You may even want to face diagonally toward the camera, so as to make your profile larger and more easily detected.

, Take extra care as a pedestrian to initiate a traffic signal change using the available crosswalk buttons, as you cannot signal the same detectors that vehicles do.


Push the appropriate button to cross the street in the intended direction and wait for the walk signal to appear before proceeding. Some intersections automatically update the pedestrian signals when the regular traffic lights change, but many must be manually engaged.
Never assume that a green traffic light indicates that you can walk if there is not also a white walk symbol illuminated for pedestrians. You should also only cross where white crosswalk symbols are painted on the roadway, whenever possible.

Try a neodymium magnet.,
Put your motorcycle’s kickstand down.,
Avoid illegal strobe light transmitters.",How to Trigger Green Traffic Lights3," Attempt to boost the electromagnetic detection of your small vehicle in an inductive loop system by attaching a small, powerful magnet to the underside of your motorcycle or bike.


Note that many find that this method is not very effective, though others have shown that it may make a difference when the magnet is moved over the loop detector at a slow speed rather than standing still.Take care in handling powerful magnets like neodymium magnets. They can interfere with pacemakers, electronic devices, and navigation systems. They can be harmful if they collide and break, corrode, or pinch fingers and other body parts., Try lowering your motorcycle’s kickstand directly onto one of the loops that you see indicated by grooves in the road’s surface.


It is possible that this small extra quantity of conductive metal placed directly on a loop’s edge can help trigger an inductive loop detector system.This will only make a difference on an inductive loop detector, though making more of a movement on your motorcycle (to put down the kickstand or otherwise) may still help in triggering a camera detector as well.

, Never attempt to activate the Traffic Signal Preemption systems in place for emergency service vehicles to travel more quickly and safely through intersections, achieved only through special transmitters and sensors.It’s a myth that flashing the high beams on your vehicle can activate the sensors that detect special infrared transmitters in emergency vehicles and some public transportation vehicles.There are some transmitters sold that effectively transmit the right signal to activate these sensors, but they are illegal to own unless authorized for an emergency services or public transportation vehicle.

Turn your cellphone on silent.,
Limit other distractions.,
Do not drive impaired.,
Limit the number of passengers in your car.",How to Avoid Accidents While Driving2," Alternatively, turn it off or place it out of reach like in the trunk or the glove box. This way you can avoid distracting calls or texts. Distracted driving was the cause of 3,000 accidents in 2013., Avoid eating, changing the CD or radio station, shaving or applying make up and other distracting behaviors while driving. These distracting behaviors can cause you to take your eyes off of the road, increasing your chances of having an accident.Wait until the the car is parked or until you get to your destination to change CDs, eat, or apply make up.

, Make sure to arrange an alternative form of transportation if you plan on drinking, using drugs, or if you are taking medications that impair your performance. Arrange to have a designated driver or use a car service to take you to where you need to go.Additionally, do not drive while you are tired. Either take a nap before driving or use a car service.

, With every additional passenger, the risk of an accident or collision increases. Therefore, try to drive with a maximum of one or two passengers at a time.If you have children, make sure they are wearing their seatbelts at all times to ensure everyone’s safety. Also, try not to reach back to retrieve something from the floor for your child while you are driving.

Limit driving at night.",How to Avoid Accidents While Driving3," Make sure to get as much supervised practice as you can. Commit to driving with an experienced driver before and after you get your driver’s license until you are comfortable driving by yourself. This way, you will have enough experience to drive safely on your own., Do this once you are comfortable driving during good weather conditions. Train for bad weather conditions by driving with an experienced driver while it is raining, snowing, foggy, or during other poor weather conditions.In general, avoid driving in extreme weather conditions whether you are an experienced driver or not.

, The risk of getting into an accident or collision is three times higher during the night. Therefore, try to limit your night driving and avoid driving after midnight. In general, avoid driving at night until you are comfortable driving during the day."

Brake carefully.,
Make sure your tires have good tread.,

Make sure your tires are inflated properly.",How to Stop Hydroplaning," Those first ten or so minutes after it starts to rain can be the most dangerous. This is because when rain first begins to fall, it stirs up oil and other substances that have dried on the road. The mixture or oil and water forms a film on the road that makes it extra slippery.


During those first few minutes, drive more slowly and be on high alert for other drivers skidding.
Heavy downpour over an extended period of time will eventually wash the roads clean, so conditions might be a little less dangerous at that point.;
, The faster you’re going, the harder it is for your car to maintain traction in wet conditions. If your tires connect with a puddle of standing water, instead of maintaining contact with the road, they'll be more likely to skid. That's why it's important to slow down in wet conditions, even if visibility is fine.


It’s fine to go under the speed limit if the roads are wet. Don't go slower than the flow of traffic, but don't feel you have to go 70 mph (110 km/h) on the highway during a downpour.
It’s especially important to go slowly if you see standing water.

, These are the spots where you’ll be most likely to hydroplane, since your tires will have difficulty maintaining traction. They aren't always easy to see, so be extra cautious (and drive a little slower) when enough rain has fallen to start collecting in puddles.


Puddles are most likely to form along the sides of the road, so try to stay in the center of the lane.Try to drive in the tire tracks left by the cars in front of you. This decreases the chance that water will build up in front of your tires and cause you to lose control of your car.
Make sure your windshield wipers are working properly. Poor visibility during rainfall leads to more accidents in part because it's difficult to see puddles through a wet windshield.

, If you're driving on the highway and using cruise control, turn it off when it starts to rain. You’ll be more in tune with the conditions around you when it’s off. You may need to reduce your speed quickly, and that's easier to do when your foot is already on the brake and you're paying careful attention to the road conditions and your speed.

, This enables you to maintain traction more easily and will prevent you from going too fast.While it's not necessarily possible to do if you're on a highway, if you're on a road with a lower speed limit driving in a lower gear can help you safely take treacherous turns or drive down hills without hydroplaning.

, If you have to brake, do so in gentle pumps; if your car has anti-lock brakes, then you can brake normally. Make sure that you don't lock the wheels, which will throw your car into a skid.


Avoid sudden acceleration and braking. Don't make sudden turns, as these could throw your car off-course.
Be extra cautious on curvy roads, taking care to steer smoothly and to drive slowly.

, When you hydroplane, so much water has built up in your tires that they lose contact with the road. Your car will behave differently depending on how you've been driving and which tires are hydroplaning.


If your vehicle has been driving straight, it will most likely feel loose and begin veering in either direction.
If the drive wheels hydroplane, there might be an increase in your speedometer and engine RPM (revolutions per minute) as your tires begin to spin.
If the front wheels hydroplane, the car will start to slip towards the outside of the bend.
If the back wheels hydroplane, the car's rear end will begin to veer sideways into a skid.
If all four wheels hydroplane, the car will slide forward in a straight line, as though it were a large sled.

, When you first start to skid, it can be panic-inducing. The car feels out of control and your impulse might be to do something rash. Try not to panic or lose your concentration. You just have to wait for the skid to stop, and stay alert so you can regain control of the car. No matter how your car reacts to hydroplaning, you can take the same steps to regain control.


Bear in mind that most hydroplane-related skids last for just a split second before your car regains traction. Waiting it out is the best way to handle the situation.
Don’t slam on the brakes or yank the steering wheel, since these actions will cause you to further lose control of the vehicle.

, Accelerating into a skid can cause you to lose control of the car and make matters worse. Don’t try to accelerate out of the skid; instead, slowly ease up, and wait a moment or to until you regain control before you accelerate again.


If you were braking when you entered the skid, ease up on the brake until it's over.
If you’re driving a manual transmission car, disengage the clutch as well., Maintain a firm grip and carefully point the car in the right direction. This technique is known as ""steering into the skid,"" and it's the best way to get your car back on track after skidding. You may need to correct the car’s course a few times with light counter-steering as you’re regaining traction.


Don’t turn too sharply or you’ll overcorrect. Jerking the wheel back and forth could cause the car to spin out of control. Keep a steady hand on the wheel and steer with small movements to correct your course.

, Never slam on your brakes when you're hydroplaning, since it will make your car do unpredictable things. If you can wait until the skid is over to brake, that's ideal. If you need to break during the skid, pump your brakes gently until you regain contact with the road.


If you have anti-lock brakes, brake normally, since your car’s automated brakes will do the pumping for you.

, Tires that are bald or have inadequate tread are unable to maintain good traction with the road, especially in slippery conditions.Having balding tires makes you much more prone to hydroplaning (as well as other tire-related problems like skidding on ice and getting flats). No matter where you live, you're sure to experience wet conditions every once in a while, so be prepared by making sure your tires are in good condition.


Worn tires are more prone to hydroplaning because they have shallow tread depth. A tire with treads that are worn halfway will hydroplane 3–4 mph (4.8–6.4 km/h) slower than fresh tires.A new tire has a tread depth of around 10/32"", and over time this gets worn down. When it reaches 2/32"", the tires are considered unsafe to drive on.
You can determine whether your tires have enough tread by checking the wear bars. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require tire manufacturers to make tires with wear bars to indicate how much tread is left. When the tread of the tire is even with the wear bars, it's time for new tires.
Try the penny trick to see if you have enough tread.If you can't find the wear bars, stick a penny into the tire's tread with Lincoln's head pointing down. If you can see the top of his head, it's time for new tires. If part of his head is buried in the tread, you can wait to get new tires.

, Tire rotation is an important way to save the treads on your tires. The type of car you have as well as your driving style can cause some tires to get worn out faster than others. Switching the tires to different wheels periodically prevents tires from wearing down too much on one side. Take your car to a mechanic or tire center and have the tires checked to see if they need to be rotated.


It's customary to rotate tires every 3,000 miles (4,800 km) or so. If you're not sure if your tires have ever been rotated, there's no harm in getting it done just in case.
Front wheel drive vehicles need more frequent tire rotation, since this causes the front tires to wear out differently from the back tires., Underinflated tires can make you more likely to hydroplane, since they have more difficulty maintaining good traction with the road. They can also deflect inwards, which makes the tire center higher and traps water easier. Changes in temperature can cause the pressure in your tires to rise and fall, so it's important to check your tires regularly. Every few months, check the air pressure in your tires to make sure they're properly inflated.


Each car is a little different, so consult the owner's manual to find out exactly how your tires should be inflated.
If necessary, inflate your tires according to the manufacturer's instructions.

When in doubt, don't cross.",How to Survive a Car Accident as a Pedestrian," Broken bones and internal bleeding can be serious, but head injuries are commonly life-threatening. Doing what you can to avoid sustaining a head injury could save your life.









Cover your head with your arms immediately, so that your forehead is in the crook of your elbows and your palms are at the back of your head.
Try to position your body so that the impact of the crash doesn't come near your head. Above all, try to avoid having your head anywhere near the wheels of the car.;
, The safety glass in all newer (post-1970s) cars is shatter-proof and can act as a ""cushion"", absorbing the energy of the impact, and hopefully breaking the glass and not you.









If you can, try to roll into a ball with your back or bottom to the glass, while keeping your head tucked between your elbows.

, Rolling on top of the car is still dangerous and will probably cause injury, but it's better than ending up on the ground and having the car roll over you.









Jump a bit as the car comes at you.
At lower speeds, you can attempt go onto the hood and over the cab on foot. This is probably the best way if your are expecting it––or if you are being targeted by the driver. Note that this will be less successful on larger vehicles.

, Sidewalks and crosswalks are generally safe havens for pedestrians on the road, so try to use them whenever possible.








If you can't walk on a sidewalk, walk so that you're facing oncoming traffic. That is, if drivers stay to the right side of the road, you should be walking on the left side of the road.

, Look right and left before crossing the street, even if you're in a crosswalk and the signal is green.









Be aware that having the right of way won't prevent you from being hit. An incapacitated or drowsy driver won't notice that you're on the sidewalk, or that you have a crosswalk signal. Pay attention to erratic driving and get well out of the way, quickly.
Stay alert. Keep your eyes and your attention on your surroundings. If you're walking through a high-traffic area, consider putting away your phone and not listening to music so you can devote your attention to staying safe.

, Ensure that motorists can see you well enough in advance to steer away from a potential accident. Here's what you can do:









Wear bright clothing. Or, if you'll be walking at night, wear clothing with reflective strips (or place them on your backpack) or carry a flashlight.
Stay out of the blind spot. If you can't see the driver's face in his or her driver's side mirror, you're in the blind spot. Be aware that the driver might not know you're there. This should include when the driver making a right turn is so intent on checking cars coming from the left, that even if it's your walk signal, the driver neglects to check for pedestrians when making the right turn.
Make eye contact. If you're going to cross the road in front of a car that is stopped or in the process of stopping, try to make eye contact with the driver. This verifies to both of you that the other is there.

, If you suspect that the driver can't see you, or that you might not be able to make it across the street in time to avoid traffic, wait it out. Traffic moves in cycles, and a better opportunity might open up in a minute or two. You might get a few minutes behind, but you'll potentially save yourself from a risky crossing.









Find an alternate route. If you're having trouble getting across a busy road, consider walking a few blocks away to another crosswalk. Again, it's better to spend a few more minutes getting across the road than crossing dangerously.

Know where all the semi-truck's blind spots are.,
Be patient.,
Do not follow a truck too closely.,
Keep both (left and right) truck mirrors in your sights as much as possible when traveling behind a truck.,
Give plenty of space when driving in front of a truck.,
Pass or overtake a truck with care.,
Avoid cutting in too soon after passing.,
Do not drive along a truck's right-hand side when the truck is turning right.,
Pay attention to a truck's brake lights and turn signals.,
Blow your horn if you see the turn signal on your side come on or if you notice a truck start moving into your lane.",How to Stay Out of a Truck's Blind Spots," A blind spot is where the driver loses sight of other vehicles.Understanding the location and scope of each blind spot or ""no zone"" can help you avoid them. The image details the no-zones.


There is a blind spot directly behind the truck. There is a ""no zone"" on each side of the truck that can span for several lanes.
There is a blind spot in front of the truck that encompasses the lane the truck is in and one lane to the right.
There is a blind spot beside the truck's right door (left door in countries that drive on the left side).;
, When sharing the road with trucks, it's important to drive carefully and to realize that trucks cannot maneuver quickly in an emergency situation. Being patient is as important as knowing where the truck's blind spots are.

, By staying close behind a truck (also known as ""tailgating""), you'll be in the truck's rear blind spot, and if the driver isn't aware of this and makes a sudden stop or maneuver, you're at risk of rear-ending into the truck. The best distance is about 20 to 25 car lengths behind a truck. This is also known as maintaining a four second following distance.In poor weather conditions, this gap should be even longer.It is also dangerous to pass from a position too close behind a truck as you cannot see the traffic ahead clearly.
Trucks traveling at high speeds create a lot of wind pressure, which is another reason for not staying too close.
At nighttime, when following a truck keep your headlights on low beam because the truck's side mirrors can reflect the light back into the car driver's eyes., If you can see the driver's face in his mirrors, then it's likely that he can see you. The moment that you cannot see the driver's face in the truck's side mirrors, he can't see you any longer.


If you lose sight of even one of the mirrors, the truck driver can no longer see your vehicle.

, Ensure that there is ample room when you change lanes in front of a truck.

, Do not pass or overtake a truck on the right hand side (left hand side in countries that keep to the left); this is because a truck's blind spot on the right runs down the length of the trailer and extends out three lanes!Signal your intention to pass early on and clearly. Be certain that the passing lane is clear before pulling out - bear in mind that it takes 25 seconds to pass a large truck on the open road.Pass quickly to stay out of the truck's side ""no zones"" area. Do not linger beside a truck but pass quickly. If you cannot pass a truck quickly, it's best to fall back behind the truck so you can be seen again.
Keep in mind that you may be subjected to turbulence when pulling out from behind the truck and when passing back in front of it.This impacts small cars and motorcyclists the most.If passing or overtaking on the crest of a hill, remember that trucks speed up on the downhill., Truckers sit high and the hood of the cab hides part of the road in front of them.You should be able to see the entire front of the truck (or both of its headlights) in your inside rear-view mirror before you pull back in front of a truck.A truck requires twice the amount of time and space to stop as does a car.Do not decelerate immediately after pulling in front of a truck after passing. You may still be in the driver's blind spot. Even if you are seen, given that it takes longer for a truck to slow down or stop, the driver may not be able to stop in time. Instead, keep traveling fast to create a distance of about 10 car spaces between you and the truck.

, A truck needs a wide berth in order to clear the turn, requiring additional lanes. When turning, the driver cannot see any vehicles on his right. This is also important for motorcyclists and bicyclists; do not attempt to slip past on the right while a truck is turning or is stopped at an intersection.


Give more room than usual if you're behind a truck that's turning right. The driver has to swing wide to the left and his trailer will block the vision of any cars behind him.

, These lights may be the only indication that a truck cannot see you. If a truck is about to turn or change lanes, be patient and wait your turn to do whatever it is you were intending.

, You are in a driver's blind spot if you notice this.


It is your only warning to a trucker that you're in the place he or she is trying to go. Hit your horn several times if necessary.
Attempt to move over a lane or onto the shoulder while blowing your horn. This might prevent your car from being hit if the driver still doesn't notice you.

Connect the rope to a tow hitch.,
Secure the rope to the frame.,
Move the vehicles apart slowly to pick up the slack.,
Put a driver in both vehicles.,
Drive the tow vehicle slowly.",How to Pull a Vehicle with a Rope1," If you are pulling a stuck vehicle out of sand, mud or snow from the back you may choose to attach the rope to the vehicle at the tow hitch. Run the rope around the tow hitch, but not the ball itself. Instead, wrap the rope around the entire hitch and hook it to itself.If the tow rope does not have a hook, use a bowline knot to secure it.
Rope may slip off the tow hitch if you secure it only to that.
Most tow ropes are three to five feet in length. You do not want a very long rope when towing a vehicle with another, as it can make managing the towed vehicle difficult.;
, Many trucks have tow hooks or loops on the frame itself. If that is the case, run the rope through the loop and hook it to itself. If the vehicle does not have tow loops, find a part of the frame to secure the rope to that will not interfere with the wheels turning. The frame is the most structurally rigid component of the vehicle. Attaching the rope to other parts could risk tearing them off or warping them.The cross member beneath the engine may be an appropriate area to attach a tow rope in your vehicle.
Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle if you are unsure of where to locate portions of your frame that are exposed.
Do not attach the rope to the axle of the vehicle. The frame is the only portion of the vehicle you should use when towing it with a rope.

, Once the rope is attached to both vehicles, pull the tow vehicle away slowly to pick up all the extra slack in the rope. It’s important to start towing with the rope taught. If the tow vehicle pulls away with slack in the rope it will subject the towed vehicle to a large amount of force very abruptly.Have a friend keep an eye on the rope and provide direction to the driver of the tow vehicle.

, While pulling a vehicle with a rope, it is imperative that you have a driver in each vehicle. Have a friend drive the tow vehicle while you steer the vehicle that is being pulled, or vice versa.Keeping a driver in both vehicles will allow for the most control in the situation.
If the towed vehicle can start, start it and keep it running while being pulled.

, Regardless of the distance you need to pull the vehicle, proceed at a low speed. If the vehicle being towed cannot start, it may not brake consistently, so maintaining a low speed will reduce the likelihood of it failing to stop if need be.Driving slowly is the only safe way to pull a vehicle with a tow rope.
Be extremely careful driving slowly while towing another vehicle on public streets.

Don't panic!,
Take your foot off the gas and turn off cruise control (if on).,
Pay attention to how your brake pedal feels.,
Pump your brakes.,
Shift into low gear.,
Use the emergency brake.,
Keep your eyes on the road and continue to steer.,
Warn other drivers and pedestrians.,
If you have room on either side of you, steer sharply from side-to-side.,
Use your surroundings to slow the vehicle.,
Look for a safe spot to pull over (or to crash).",How to Stop a Car with No Brakes," Overreacting to this situation will only make it more dangerous.






;
, Cruise control systems should turn off as soon as you touch the brake or clutch, but to be safe, make sure it's switched off.








, If it’s soft and goes to the floor, you may have low fluid, a faulty master cylinder or problems with your drums or calipers. You may be able to rebuild some braking pressure by pumping the brakes.









If, however, your brake pedal is hard and does not move, something in your brake system may have seized or you may have an obstruction under the pedal. Try to feel with your foot (or have a passenger look) to see whether you have something under the brake pedal.

, Pumping your brakes several times may rebuild enough pressure in the braking system for you to stop. This may take a while, so keep trying. You should do this even if your car is equipped with ABS, as the ABS is only activated when your car is braking too hard (which won't be the problem if your brakes have failed). Then, regardless of whether the car has ABS brakes or not, quickly squeeze the brakes down to the floor to make the most out of all of the pressure you have preserved or built-up, as hydraulic (or air) brakes rarely fail all together. Keep the brakes squeezed to the floor.








, Shifting into lower gears helps slow you by using your engine to slow the car. If you have an automatic transmission, downshift a gear at a time into low range (generally labeled as “1” on the shifting mechanism). If you have a manual transmission, downshift a gear or two at a time, feel the car slow, and repeat as you work down through the gears. Unless you need to slow the car as soon as possible, be careful not to downshift too quickly; rapid downshifts into first or second gear can cause you to lose control.









If you have tap-to-shift, shift into manual ""M"" (generally to the right or left of ""Drive"" on console-shift vehicles or the bottom gear on column-shift vehicles) and press the minus button to shift down. Again, if you can’t go directly into the lowest range, try gradually shifting down.
If you have an additional means of slowing down the car, like a retarder, exhaust brake, or Jake brake, use it slowly.

, The emergency brake, or parking brake, can usually stop a vehicle, although it will take longer than usual to come to a stop because it only stops the rear wheels. Apply the brake (depending on your vehicle this is done either by pulling up on the handle or pushing down on the pedal) slowly and steadily; your emergency brake can lock your tire if applied too hard or too fast, especially at high speed. If you pull up the brake quickly, you may lose control of your vehicle. To prevent this, keep the release button engaged (if your car has one) as you apply the emergency brake. This allows you to modulate the pressure with which you are applying the brake.









If you feel or hear your tires lock, release a small bit of pressure from the brake application and hold it there. It should be stated that if the tires do squeal slightly, it does not necessarily mean that they are indeed locked-up. With a handlebar E-brake, one can initially apply it up to three clicks (to enable a controlled slow-down) and then apply an additional one or two extra clicks (to bring the car to a final halt).

, Pay attention to what’s in front of you, and maneuver to avoid heavy traffic, pedestrians, and dangerous obstacles.








, Turn your hazard lights on, and honk your horn to make others aware that there is a problem. (Be sure to know the location of the hazard light button prior to such a situation.) While they may not be able to figure out what the problem is, a warning should cause most people to proceed with caution and pay attention to what your vehicle is doing. Open windows to allow air resistance to slow you down as well as enable you to shout to other passengers and drivers.








, Turning creates friction, which slows your car naturally. If you do not have brakes, try turning sharply from left to right over and over to slow your car down. Do not do this at high speeds. Turning at high speeds may flip your car and turning too sharply at any speed can spin your car around, so be careful.








, If the above measures fail to stop you, or if you must stop very quickly, do whatever you can to get under control. Ideally, you could use a runaway truck ramp, but as these are not particularly common, you’ll probably have to improvise. Keep in mind, however, that these techniques can be very dangerous – especially at high speeds – and should only be used as last resorts.









Use terrain to your advantage. Try to seek out inclines that you can go up. If this does not bring your car to a stop, be prepared to do some reverse driving and/or use the emergency brake at the appropriate time.
Use guardrails to slow your vehicle. Cement dividers are built pear-shaped so that contact is made with the wheels, not with the precious metal and paint of your automobile. Applying friction to the rubber on your wheels will slow the car considerably without harming other portions of your vehicle. You can also gently sideswipe whatever is available.
Use road friction to slow your vehicle. Driving through gravel or dirt (such as you might find right off the side of the road) can slow your vehicle considerably. Be very cautious when using this technique. Sudden terrain changes -- especially if only under the wheels on one side of the car -- can cause the car to flip, and may cause serious injury or death to yourself or others. Approach to a graveled or grassy shoulder must be made progressively, smoothly and gently. Afterward, the car must be stabilized as it is driving along the shoulder of the road.
Small trees and shrubbery will slow your vehicle when all else fails. Try to put your vehicle through the center of a line of shrubs or saplings, being careful not to pick a tree that is too heavy for your car to go through. Trees with trunks over 4 inches (116 mm) are considered dangerous to occupants of motor vehicles. Large trees can be fatal.
Hit the back of another car. While obviously not a first choice, it will slow your vehicle. If you’re going to do so, try to warn the driver in front of you by honking your horn. Try to strike a vehicle that is traveling at about the same speed as yours (hitting a slow-moving or parked car will stop you, but the deceleration will be quick and extreme) and attempt to make impact squarely on the back of the vehicle. Glancing blows will likely send both vehicles out of control. Be extremely careful not to hit too hard as your airbag may go off.

, Scan the road ahead for a safe area to pull over once you’re able to come to a stop. If you’re not able to bring the vehicle to a complete stop, look for open spaces that you can coast across without hitting anything.









If all alternatives have failed, plan a crash stop. The safest method is to look for a bushy protrusions or shrubs and run it through the friction will significantly reduce car speed to a halt. if there are no bushes go for grass, especially tall grass run the car through the tall grass and it will come to a halt. finally if there is none the last way is go for sand, sand is so unstable will definitely halt your car, especially wet sand.
If the safest spot to ""crash land"" your vehicle requires you to jump a curb, extra caution must be taken. Even with power steering, the cars' initial reaction will be to rip the steering wheel from your hands, bounce from the curb and back into traffic. It is imperative that you grip the steering wheel in a firm manner and angle your car deep enough into the curb so that it will go up and over, yet shallow enough so that you don't turn the car completely and lose control in a spin.

Clean your windshield.,
Make sure your mirrors and windows are clean.,
Clean your headlights.",How to Reduce Glare when Driving at Night1," Use windshield cleaner to clean the inside and outside of your windshield at least once a month. If you know you are about to drive for a lengthy period at night, make sure to clean your windshield beforehand as well.Alternatively, you can use a mixture of water, dishwashing detergent and vinegar to clean your windshield. Mix six cups (1,400 ml) of water, a tablespoon (30 ml) of detergent and a cup (240 ml) of vinegar together until well-combined. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture and use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe your windshield clean.;
, Clean your side mirrors and windows once a month, or as they become dirty. You can use the detergent-vinegar solution to clean these as well. Spray the solution onto a microfiber cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of your windows clean, as well as the surfaces of your outside mirrors.To avoid streaks, make sure to dry your windows and side mirrors with a clean microfiber cloth afterwards.

, You can use toothpaste to do this. Wet your headlights with a damp cloth. Apply a tablespoon (30 ml) of toothpaste to each headlight. Using the damp cloth, scrub the toothpaste over the entire surface. Scrub for one minute, focusing on dirty areas. Then rinse the headlights with water and dry them with a clean microfiber cloth.If the toothpaste method does not work, then you may need to get your headlights professionally buffed and cleaned.

Be on time to the bus.,
Remember your training.,
Practice a focused routine.,
Look at everything.,
Drive the bus.,
Pull over to deal with any issues that might arise.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Maintain Total Focus While Driving a School Bus," That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you. When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot. Get there on time, relax, get your head together, and stroll up to the bus with the kind of head you'd like to have while actually driving it. If you are late, you better take a moment and a few deep breaths wouldn't hurt. Make sure you've got your act together because those kids ain't going to get it together for you!;
, If you are driving a bus, you have been trained. From start to finish, your training should give you the perfect template for maintained focus. Remember your pre-trip and post-trip inspection items as well as driving and backing procedures. Do these things the way you trained in them, not in the ""this is the real world and no one is looking"" way. Limit conversation during inspections and do not talk on the phone or radio at all while driving - even to administrators. Pull over if you must. If you remember your training, and practice your training while you drive, you'll maintain a very high level of focus.

, Train yourself to maintain focus during your route. Routines are monotonous, and it's easy to get sloppy and lose focus on what's important sometimes, like cars and pedestrians. Integrate focus into your routine. For example, train yourself to check traffic both ways, three times, every time. Or train yourself to do a left-to-right and back again all mirror check before driving off from every drop off point. Integrating focus routines into your route will greatly reduce the chances of an accident with other drivers, pedestrians, and especially your students.

, Keep your eyes peeled and your head on the swivel. Read every sign you pass, everyday. Yeah, you may not need to read the Amish Farmer's Market sign, but it keeps your skills razor sharp. Also, get into the habit of looking at all the cars around you. ""Where's he going? What's she about to do? Are they about to pull out?"" That's how you train yourself to be able to judge when an oncoming car isn't going to stop for your stop arm. As an added perk, you get pretty good at giving car descriptions to the police.

, Let's face it, you have your back turned to three score and some odd kids that are up to who knows what. It's tempting to look into the big rear view, give 'em the ole Clint Eastwood murder eyes and do some hollerin', but that would be shifting focus off of the road - while you are driving. Drive the bus, and drive it safely. If the students become a handful, pull that cheese wagon over, talk to them, call the office, write them up (or whatever works according to your school board's particular procedures). Most problems can and must be dealt with after the route is over, and always, always, when the bus is parked.

, As previously mentioned, it is sometimes necessary to find a safe place to pull over. It may be a fight, a sick kid, or a bug on the bus that has everyone in a full apocalyptic panic. If it ever crosses your mind that it might be a good idea to pull over to deal with something, then it probably is. It's always better than having an accident. Heaven forbid, there may even be times that you lose focus because of one thing or another. Pull over safely for a moment and get it together.

, Sometimes you need help backing up because you can't see. Ask a student to make sure that you don't run over that garbage can. But there may be times you need help on the bus, whether it be discipline problems, medical emergency, a breakdown, etc. When these things happen you still need to maintain total focus, but in these unusual circumstances the students will become overly excited, making total focus extremely difficult. If you need serious help, pullover and ask for it.

Use a winch.,
Tie the vehicle to a tree with a long rope.,
Gather a group of friends.,
Tie a rope around the midpoint in the tow rope.,
Pull on the perpendicular rope.",How to Pull a Vehicle with a Rope2," If you have access to a winch, it is the easiest way to pull a vehicle with a rope a short distance without using a second vehicle. Secure the winch to the frame of the vehicle using the supplied mounting hardware, then attach the rope on the other side to a solid, immovable object.Wrap the winch line around a tree that is at least a foot in diameter then hook it to itself.
You may also use rocks or guardrails to attach your vehicle.
Use the controls on the winch to pull the vehicle.

, If you do not have a winch, you may be able to pull a vehicle far enough to get it unstuck using a long rope and a group of friends. Secure the rope to the frame of the vehicle, then tie the other end to a strong tree.You will need at least twenty feet of rope between the vehicle and the tree.
Ensure the rope is taught between the two.
A bowline knot will support the weight required and still allow you to untie the rope when you are done.

, You may be able to pull a small vehicle out of whatever it is stuck in with only one or two friends, but larger vehicles will require more friends to assist. Gather a group of as many friends as you can before you start to ensure you are able to pull the vehicle.The more friends you gather, the easier it will be.
Ensure you have plenty of extra rope so there’s enough room for everyone to assist.

, With the rope taught between the car and the tree, tie a second rope around the midpoint between the two. If the rope is too close to the tree or the car, this method will not work.If you have enough rope, you can simply wrap it around the midpoint and use both ends to pull from.
If you do not have enough rope to wrap it around the midpoint, tie it to the other rope with a bowline knot.

, On the count of three, have all of your friends pull the rope you tied around the midpoint in the tow rope. Pulling in such a manner will dramatically increase the leverage you place on the vehicle and allow you to pull the vehicle a short distance.Pulling from this angle will allow you to pull a car you would not otherwise be able to pull.

Ensure your rope is strong enough.,
Assess what level of control the towed vehicle will have.,
Determine the distance you will need to tow.,
Find out the laws in your area.",How to Pull a Vehicle with a Rope3," When purchasing a rope to pull a vehicle, the most important thing to look for is the strength of the rope. Most ropes in retail stores will indicate on the packaging what the maximum amount of weight the rope is rated to pull without failing is. Use your vehicle’s owner’s manual to determine the weight of your vehicle and choose a tow rope rated for that weight.Most tow ropes that can be purchased at auto parts stores are sufficient to pull normal sized cars or trucks.
Do not use a rope if you aren’t able to determine its maximum strength rating.

, If the vehicle you are pulling will start, but cannot drive, it is best to start it and allow it to run as you pull it. This will allow you to utilize the power steering and brakes. If the vehicle will not start, insert the key and turn it so the accessories come on and the steering wheel unlocks.Some vehicle’s brakes will not function properly without the vacuum created by the engine running.
The vehicle will not have power steering without the engine running.

, If you need to pull a vehicle just a few feet, there are fewer concerns you will need to address before getting moving. If you need to pull the vehicle to your house or a repair facility you will need to assess the vehicle’s ability to cover that distance safely.If the vehicle will not start, it is not safe to tow it a long distance. Without power steering or brakes the towed vehicle may crash into the tow vehicle.
If you need to pull a vehicle out of mud, snow or a ditch, you will only need to pull it until it can move under its own power.

, If you intend to pull a vehicle with a tow rope on public streets, you will need to determine if it is legal to do so. Check into the laws in the region you will be towing the vehicle through in order to determine if it is legal to do so.Laws in the United States vary from state to state regarding towing a vehicle with a rope.
In some places it is illegal to tow a vehicle with a rope at all.

Keep your eyeglasses clean.,
Look into anti-reflective coating.,
Avoid looking straight into the headlights of oncoming traffic.,
Get an eye check-up regularly.",How to Reduce Glare when Driving at Night2," Before driving, always make sure your eyeglasses are clean. Use soap and water to remove dirt, grime and debris from the lenses. Finish cleaning your lenses by drying them with a soft microfiber cloth., If you wear glasses, ask your optometrist about anti-reflective (AR) coating. AR coating is an ultra-thin film made from silicon and zircon. By reducing internal reflection and transmitting more light, the film will improve your vision while driving during the night., Instead, avert your eyes when oncoming traffic approaches. Do this by looking down and to the right. Focus on the white line on the side of the road, or the pavement until the car passes.As you do this, you will still be able to see other cars around you with your peripheral vision.

, Having difficulty seeing and other medical problems associated with the eyes can exacerbate glare while driving at night. Make sure to visit your eye doctor regularly. This way you can catch and correct any eye problems to avoid vision problems while driving at night.The American Optometric Association recommends that you get an eye check-up every two years if you are under 60, and once a year if you are 60 or older.

Use your rearview mirror’s night setting.,
Make sure your headlights are aligned properly.,
Check the alignment of your side mirrors.,
Keep you interior lights off.",How to Reduce Glare when Driving at Night3," Look for a small switch or lever under or behind your rearview mirror. By switching this lever, you can change your rearview mirror to its night setting. With this setting on, the headlights from the cars driving behind you will appear much dimmer, and they are less likely to produce glare while driving at night.If your car doesn’t have self-dimming mirrors, then you may want to replace your mirrors with self-dimming ones, or look into getting a car that has these already.

, You will need to go to your car dealership or auto mechanic to have this checked. Having your headlights properly aligned will help you see better while driving at night. It will help other cars see you better at night as well.Have your headlight alignment checked once a year.

, To properly align your side mirrors, rest your head against the driver seat's window. Adjust the mirror outwards until you can see your car's rear corner. Then, lean to the other side until your head is in the center of the car. Adjust your other mirror until you can see the rear corner on the other side of your car.Having your side mirrors properly aligned helps reduce glare while driving at night, as well as blind spots.

, Having the lights on inside your car can exacerbate glare, making it even more difficult to see. If you have to, only use these lights for a couple of seconds while driving at night."

Position the car as far to the right as you can.,
Turn left as close to the corner as you can.,
Use your brake as late as possible.,
Exit the turn as far to the right as possible.",How to Make a Tight Turn Quickly in a Car1," This will allow you to move the car in a wider arc and to get the most momentum as you turn. This is what you should do if you're making a tight left turn. If you're turning right, then follow the opposite of the directions, and start on the left side of the road.





;
, You can also think of the corner as the ""apex"" of the turn. Turn toward the turn as quickly as you can without hitting it.








, As you turn the car, press down the brake so you don't spin out of control, but don't press them down all the way. Press the brake just as much as you need to to slow down the car enough to make the turn safely, but not so much that they slow you down or jerk the car or make it swerve.









As you turn into the corner, you must be almost completely off the brakes, but still lightly on them, to allow maximal traction to the guiding wheels. After the car has turned into the corner, apply the throttle to the point where the car is not speeding up or slowing down. As you exit the corner, apply the power progressively while slowly taking off the steering.

, This will make you turn with the widest radius and straightest line possible, which will make you move as fast as possible. Following this line also gives you the best traction and the most efficiency for laying down the power coming out of the turn.

Recognize your rising anger.,
Take time to calm down.,
Use deep-breathing techniques.,
Listen to calming music.,
Count until you calm down.,
Try using ""hand yoga"".,
Resist the urge to retaliate.,
Keep your distance.",How to Stay Calm During Road Rage1," The most obvious signs of anger are often physical symptoms that emerge after the fact (like voice tone, language, and gestures). But with practice, you'll learn to recognize the warning signs of anger when you mentally check in on yourself.Common signs of anger include angry/vengeful thoughts, muscle tension, headaches, or elevated heart rate.
If you catch yourself speaking out loud (even when you're driving alone) about another driver, you may be experiencing elevated anger.
By catching yourself as your anger first emerges, you can prevent that anger from turning into aggression or road rage.;
, If you notice yourself feeling angry, it may be best to pull over (if it's safe to do so). Get off the highway or pull over to the shoulder of the road (again, only if it's safe to do this) and put your vehicle in park. Take a few minutes to collect your thoughts and calm yourself down before returning to the road.Practice deep breathing or meditation to calm your mind and body after experiencing anger.
Remember that driving while you're angry puts yourself and others at risk. Even if you're not yet experiencing full-blown road rage, your anger may cause you to drive recklessly and take unnecessary risks.

, Using deep-breathing exercises can help you calm down and center yourself when you feel angry or tense. Deep breathing is quick and easy, and it can be done while you're driving or stationary.Take a long, slow inhalation into your diaphragm over a five-second span. Make sure you're breathing into your diaphragm (below your ribs) and belly instead of just taking shallow breaths in your chest.
Hold your breath for five seconds
Exhale slowly over another five-second span.

, A good way to relax when you start to experience road rage is to listen to soothing music (if you can do so without being distracted). Music can help you calm down and focus on getting to your destination safely.Try keeping a few relaxing CDs in an easy to reach spot in your car, or keep your radio tuned to a station that plays calming music. That way you can play music without having to take your eyes off the road.
Figure out what types of music are most relaxing for you. Try jazz, oldies, and classical music for calm, soothing melodies.
Avoid listening to fast-paced, aggressive, or angsty music while driving.

, You may have seen someone in your family or a character in a movie or TV show counting to avoid getting angry. It's an age-old trick to calm down and prevent an outburst, and it may help you in your moment of anger.Count upwards for about a minute. If you focus on your breathing and distract yourself with counting, you'll stop actively thinking about the person who wronged you and gradually cool down.
If you don't feel better after a minute, try counting for another minute. The key is to stop yourself from thinking angry thoughts long enough for your active rage to pass.

, Hand yoga is the act of stretching and tensing/relaxing the muscles in your hands. It may sound strange, but for some people it's an excellent way to relieve stress - just be sure to only take your hands off the wheel when your car is at a complete stop in traffic or at a red light.Spread your fingers and stretch out both hands as much as possible.
Hold this position for a few seconds, then release it.
Curl each finger individually into your palm, pushing gently with your thumb. Hold it, then release.
Flex your wrists and bend each knuckle individually to ""shake out"" the muscles and joints.

, If someone cuts you off or is driving too slowly, your initial reaction may be to honk your horn, scream, swear, or use profane gestures. This may make you feel better for an instant, but it will almost certainly aggravate the other driver, and could set you both down a rage-filled path.


Avoid any inflammatory gestures. This can include honking your horn, flashing your high beams, or extending your middle finger. Each of these may result in an escalated and violent reaction.Try to avoid even yelling or screaming. If you shout swear words at another driver and your window happens to be open, there’s a chance that driver could hear you and respond with his own aggression.

, Some people feel compelled to tailgate when they are cut off or otherwise ""wronged"" by other drivers. This is a potentially dangerous move. Tailgating increases the risk of causing an accident, and it could also trigger the other driver's anger.Use the four-second rule. When the car ahead of you passes a sign or lamp post, start counting and slow down so you don't pass that same post until at least four seconds later.

Prevent or minimize future encounters with black ice.",How to Drive on Black Ice," It is a glaze that forms on surfaces (especially roads, sidewalks, and driveways) because of a light freezing rain or because of melting and re-freezing of snow, water, or ice on surfaces. It's called ""black ice"" because it tends to look like the rest of the pavement on the road, although in reality, it's actually clear. Black ice forms without creating bubbles, which allows it to blend in with any surface it forms over.Black ice is dangerous precisely because it's hard to detect in advance.;
, Black ice usually forms just about the freezing point. Sometimes in frigid weather conditions on highways, black ice will form due to the heat of tires on the road coupled with the freezing temperature. Keep an eye on the weather and highway reports.


Black ice forms most commonly at night or in the early morning when the temperatures are at their lowest, or when the sun isn't around to warm the roads.Black ice tends to form on parts of the road without much sunshine, such as along a tree-lined route or a tunnel. It will also form more frequently on roads that are less traveled on.
Black ice forms readily on bridges, overpasses and the road beneath overpasses. This is because the cold air is able to cool both the top and under the bridge or overpass, bringing about faster freezing., Black ice tends to form in the early morning and evening. During the daylight hours, the road is usually warmer and less likely to create black ice. But remember: less likely does not mean ""never"". Always be prepared for the possibility of encountering black ice.


See the signs of black ice. If you are driving and see cars suddenly swerve for no apparent reason, black ice is a likely cause.

, While black ice is transparent, it can sometimes be seen in the right lighting conditions - if you are looking for it. Black ice almost always forms in very smooth, very glossy sheets. This glossy surface is your indication of potential black ice. If the majority of the road you're driving on appears a dull black color, but the patch just ahead of you appears shiny, you may be about to drive onto black ice - don't panic, follow the instructions below.


This technique for helping to detect black ice won't work at night, but dawn, daylight and dusk all offer enough light to see.
If you are unfamiliar with this glossy appearance, think of a nice new car's black spray paint compared to an older, un-kept car's black paint job.
You won't always be able to see black ice, but looking for it can't hurt. It may also help you to stay focused in less than ideal driving conditions. Just be sure to keep your eyes on the rest of your environment as well.

, If possible, (and with a seasoned winter driver) practice driving on ice in a safe surrounding. Find a nice, large, empty parking lot with ice on it. Drive on ice. Practice braking on ice. Understand how your car feels and handles in these conditions. Know what ABS braking feels like if you have it. Practicing this under controlled conditions can actually be a lot of fun!

, If you do hit black ice, your first reaction must be to remain calm and avoid overreacting. The general rule is to do as little as possible and allow the car to pass over the ice. Do not hit the brakes, and try to keep the steering wheel straight. If you feel the back end of your car sliding left or right, make a very gentle turn of the steering wheel in the same direction. If you try to struggle against it by steering in the opposite direction, you risk skidding or spinning out (see below for what to do if this happens).

, Lift your feet off the accelerator completely and keep your steering wheel fixed in the position it's in. Slowing down will give you more control and prevent needless damage.



Do not touch the brakes. Doing so will likely cause you to skid. The idea is to slide over the ice in the direction the steering wheel is facing; usually black ice patches aren't longer than 20 feet (6 metres).

, Low gears will give you more control.

, Black ice is virtually invisible, but you may be able to head towards areas of pavement that offer more traction. Such areas of traction may include textured ice, snow-covered areas, spots with sand, etc.

, Hopefully, you are now going slow and this will make it easier. Black ice is often (although not always) patchy, so hopefully your tires will soon find traction. Use the minimum amount of braking possible, although some braking will be necessary if skidding a lot, as follows:


If you have anti-lock braking system (ABS), just put your foot on the brake, apply firm pressure and the car will pump the brakes for you as you skid.
If you don't have ABS, pump the brakes gently as you skid.
Always steer the car in the direction you want the car to go.

, Ideally, steer into an empty field, a yard, or a fluffy snowbank. Of course, you may not have much choice in the matter, but you can at least try.

, You're likely to be a bit rattled, but panicking isn't going to help at any stage. If you must keep driving, do so very, very slowly. Alert other drivers that you're going slowly by flashing your lights at all times.

, It's better to wait a while at a rest stop, diner, or even on the side of the road until the road crews can salt and/or sand the roads than to deal with an accident. This will also provide you with a chance to recover your senses and feel less panicked. Have a hot drink and relax a while.


If there is a pile up: Very rarely ice and/or black ice can make extremely hazardous conditions that can cause multi-car accidents on a highway. You will have to evaluate quickly whether staying in your car (where you have some safety protection) or getting out (where you can flee further collisions but will have to walk on icy surfaces, in freezing temperatures, with other cars spinning out of control around you) is safer. Consider your location, the speed of travel, geographic location, your warmth, and your physical abilities.

, There are several things that you can do to reduce the chances of being surprised by black ice. While knowing how to drive on it remains a number one priority, here are some other things to do:


Travel slowly. Don't try to speed during icy weather as this will take away any control you might have had on the black ice.
Don't tailgate.
Keep your windshield clear of ice, snow, dirt, and anything else that can prevent you from seeing out of it properly. To get snow and ice off the windshield of your car, you might be tempted to turn on your windshield wipers. It might seem like the wipers and the washer fluid will work, but they don't. In fact, if you use your windshield wipers to get ice off the windshield, you could ruin them. Use an ice scraper to scrape the ice from the windshield of your car before starting the vehicle.
Turn your headlights on early in the afternoon to help you see any possible sheen from black ice.
Check your tire tread. Worn tread causes accidents in any conditions, and will ensure you lack traction when needed on black ice. In addition, consider having snow tires fitted.
An important thing to remember is to NEVER drive in potentially icy conditions with your cruise control active.

Have a location in mind to place the flare before you light it.,

Locate the cap at one end of the flare.,

Look at the cap.,

Remove the cap, exposing the end of the flare.,
Hold the flare as far away from your body and face as possible.,

Light the flare much the same way as you would light a match.,
Carry the lighted flare pointed downward and away from yourself, so that no burning residues can drip back onto your hand.,Replace the cap on the back end of the flare (the end that is not burning).,

Set the flare on the ground, away from vehicles and flammable materials and be sure that it will not roll.,
Make sure that the flare is extinguished before leaving the site.",How to Light a Road Flare," A level, paved surface, free of dried vegetation, is best. If you are lighting the flare for roadside use, you should place multiple flares well behind the vehicle, so that oncoming traffic has time to move over. A hundred steps behind or ""upstream"" of your vehicle is a good distance for the first one. Make certain there is no gasoline leaking from any cars nearby and if there is gasoline leaking, consider NOT using a flare.
, It will generally have a rough striking surface on the outside edge. Remove the plastic lid or cap to expose this surface, if necessary., Often, the caps are designed with a fold-out tabs or a flat side that will help prevent the lit flare from rolling around. Identify this feature and get it ready before lighting the flare., You may need to twist gently. The end of the flare will have an ignition surface or ""button"". This is the end you will light., Stand with your left or right shoulder facing into the wind. Point it away from yourself and others. Also, remember to hold the flare by the middle, with your hand away from the end you will be lighting., Rub the end of the flare briskly against the coarse striking surface on the cap. There is no need to strike too firmly. Remember, the flare will spray ignited, molten material from its end so if you are wearing good clothing you may damage your clothing, Keep the burning end of the flare away from hair and clothing.,, Do not drop it. If you drop the flare you will have less control over its location, and the flare could break. If you think you need to extend the burn time of a flare, you can stack one burning flare over the other non-burning flare (bottom of burning flare crosses over the head of the non-burning flare), If you wish to extinguish a lighted flare before it burns out, either douse it completely with water or tap the lighted end against the ground to break the burning part off of the rest of the flare. Smothering the flame is unlikely to be effective."

Place your hands on the steering wheel in a way that would allow you to quickly turn it in a full circle.,
Start turning before you pull the handbrake.,
Press the handbrake a split second after you start turning.,
Center the wheel and the front wheels of your car.,
Release the handbrake.,
Apply the brake to set the car on the right path if necessary.",How to Make a Tight Turn Quickly in a Car2,", So, if you're making a 180-degree turn and turning right, place your right hand on the left side of the steering wheel so you can quickly turn it to the right.








, Take pressure off the accelerator and go into neutral if you have an automatic car or floor the clutch if you have a manual car, and quickly turn the steering wheel in the direction that you want it to go until the wheel locks.








, Quickly press down the handbrake, or press the foot operated brake if you have one, after you've started making the turn. This will lock the rear wheels of the car and will keep it from spinning out of control.








, This will position your car in the opposite direction that you were originally driving from.








, Release the handbrake as you're centering your car so you can regain control of your wheels and the direction of your movement.








, Applying some light pressure to your brake can help you straighten out your car and keep it from spinning out of control as you drive off in the opposite direction.

Keep both hands on the wheel.,
Turn the car gently into the curve.,
Use the throttle to control the radius of the turn.,
Exit the curve.",How to Make a Tight Turn Quickly in a Car3," This will help you maintain control of the car.








, Try to turn the car as gently and accurately as possible while keeping your foot lightly on the accelerator.








, More throttle will set you wider, less will set you tighter. If the car seems to turn too much, the back-end is probably skidding. You will need to ease off the power almost completely, slide the wheel just a bit through your hands, and then apply the throttle as hard as possible for one moment.








, When exiting a fast curve, you can re-apply the throttle very quickly, as the wheels would never spin at such speeds.

Stay calm.,
Refrain from making eye contact.,
Drive defensively.,
Give others the benefit of the doubt.,
Get help if you need it.,
Keep your priorities in mind.",How to Stay Calm During Road Rage2," If someone is swerving towards you, honking, yelling, or flashing their high beams at you, you may feel scared or anxious. The important thing is to try and remain calm, and do whatever you can to get home safely.


Keep your own emotions in check when others act aggressively.Recognize how you're feeling, and drive as defensively as possible.
Try making yourself more comfortable to keep calm. Turn on the air conditioning to cool off, and adjust your seating position (if you can do so safely) to get better situated in your vehicle.
Remember that at the end of the day, it's just traffic. Someone else's bad driving shouldn't ruin your day, but if you lose your temper, it could end up ruining your life.

, If someone is showing signs of aggression, whether through honking their horn, flashing you with high beams, or just driving aggressively, make sure you avoid eye contact with that person. Experts warn that making eye contact with an enraged driver can be seen by that driver as a sign of aggression, and could usher in escalated attacks.Put your signal on to indicate that the other car can pass you (if he is trying to get around you).
Keep your eyes forward on the road. Do not even glance in the other driver's direction.

, If someone is behaving aggressively, it's best to let that person pass by and be on his way. If that driver is in front of you, you can watch him to ensure your safety.If he's behind you, though, he could follow you or try to escalate things further.If the aggressive driver wants to pass you, let him.
Any time someone wants to merge into your lane, let them. (Assuming you can do so safely.)
Try to avoid braking suddenly by keeping your eyes on the road at all times and scanning the sides of the road for potential hazards.
Don't tailgate.
Avoid blocking traffic, as this may cause other drivers to grow angry or impatient.

, When another driver cuts you off, changes lanes without signaling, swerves towards you, or engages in any other perceived act of aggression, you may assume that person is showing you hostility. However, it's possible that the other driver made a mistake. He may not have seen you, or he may be distracted by some pending family emergency. For all you know he's on his way to the hospital, and not out to get you.Remember that humans are capable of making mistakes, even behind the wheel. You've probably made a few yourself.
Sometimes extreme situations like poor health or the death of a loved one can cause people to act out in ways they may not even recognize.
Before you assume someone was driving aggressively and honk your horn or make a rude gesture, remember that that person may be experiencing something you're not aware of.

, If someone is following you and it's clear he intends to engage in some act of aggression, do not go home or to your workplace. That would make you an easy target for violence while also letting the driver know where you live or work. Instead, try to get someplace safe where there are a lot of people, or someplace you know the police can help you.Keep your car doors locked and your windows rolled up. Do not get out of the car, no matter how much another driver tries to antagonize you.
Any time someone follows you, take a detour to get somewhere safe, no matter how late you are.
Drive to the nearest police station. If the other driver is following you with the intention of assaulting you, he'll think twice before doing so in front of a police station.
If you can't get to a police station, try getting someplace crowded with people and call the police.
You should always avoid talking on a phone while driving, but if someone is following you you'll need to call the police before you even think about stopping your vehicle.

, In the heat of the moment, it may be very tempting to respond to someone's aggression with your own anger. However, this is simply not worth the risk. Many people are injured or killed during road rage-fueled exchanges with other drivers. Remember that responding to anger with anger will only add fuel to the fire.


Try keeping an image of a loved one taped to your dashboard. This can help remind you of everything you'd lose if you got arrested for assault or killed by someone else's violent outburst.Remember that aggressive behavior can lead to your own injury or death, or the injury/death of another person. It's simply not worth the risk.Driving is not a contest. You and everyone else on the road ultimately wants to get home safely to your loved ones."

Check your mood before driving.,
Drive when you're awake and sober.,
Give yourself extra time.,
Avoid traffic whenever possible.,
Take public transit.",How to Stay Calm During Road Rage3," If you leave your home or workplace in an angry, irritated, or otherwise upset mood, there's a good chance that a minor traffic incident could set you off. One of the easiest ways to prevent your own road rage is to wait until you're calm enough to drive without feeling emotional or agitated.Before you turn the ignition, do a quick mental and emotional check-in with yourself.
Ask yourself whether anything emotionally upsetting has happened to you in the last few hours. If you're leaving from home, that might mean an argument with your partner or neighbor. If leaving work, it could mean any number of possible events.
Assess how you are coping with whatever stressors are happening in your day. Think about any times you might have grown impatient with others, lost your temper, or had angry thoughts about another person.
Find ways to calm down before you drive. If you can safely go for a short walk to clear your head, try doing that. If not, try sitting in your car and meditate for a few minutes until you feel calmer.

, Studies show that being overly tired can lead to a loss of emotional control, which can have ramifications when you're behind the wheel. In addition to being well-rested and wakeful, it's important to always drive sober, as alcohol can lower your inhibitions and may lead you to feel angry or belligerent (to say nothing of your impaired driving ability).Try keeping snacks on hand in your car, as hunger can sometimes cause frustrated drivers to experience road rage.Driving when you're well-rested, fed, and sober is the safest way to travel.

, If you're heading someplace important, give yourself a little extra time for traffic. That way you won't be stressed if you get stuck in traffic, and you'll be less likely to end up engaging in road rage behavior.You probably know that you should leave early enough to manage your usual commute time, but figuring out traffic may be more difficult.
Check your local Department of Transportation, police reports, and news updates for any information on current traffic patterns near you. There may be an accident or construction work that you didn't know about.
Some state Department of Transportation websites offer commuters a travel time calculator. These calculators ask where you're leaving from, where you're heading, and what time you need to arrive by, then cross-check your commute with relevant traffic updates., If you live in a rural area, you are probably somewhat limited in your travel options. But if you live in or near a more urban area, you may be able to find a detour around the traffic that's waiting up ahead.


If you're traveling with at least one other passenger, you may qualify for the car pool lane. Check your local ordinances, however, as some places require a minimum of three occupants in a given car.Avoid peak traffic times. This will vary from one city to the next, but traffic is generally at its worst between 7:00 and 10:00 AM and from 3:00 to 7:00 PM.Download and use traffic apps. These can detect upcoming traffic jams and reroute you accordingly. Just be sure to set it up before you drive, as driving and fidgeting with your phone could cause an accident.

, The surefire way to prevent road rage is to avoid driving in traffic altogether. If you live in or near a big city, there's a good chance that you have access to an affordable public transit system. Even if you don't live in a major metropolitan area like New York City, your city most likely has an extensive network of bus routes, light transit rails, and/or subway lines.Taking public transportation takes the stress out of commuting. You can read, listen to music, or simply tune out while the driver deals with traffic.
Most public transit options are affordable, and when compared to the cost of gas and parking, taking a bus/subway may actually be cheaper than driving.
Even if your city's public transit lines don't run right to your block, you can walk or bike to the nearest transit stop. Your community may even have park-and-ride options so you can drive to your nearest subway/light rail stop.
Check your city's public transportation options by searching online for bus/rail systems in your area.

Use the steering to pull your vehicle out of a slide.,
Know the recommended braking procedure to use during a slide.",How to Recover From Loss of Traction1,"


Pay attention to where the vehicle is going. Are the back wheels sliding around you to the right? Or are they sliding to the left?
Turn the steering wheel the same direction as the back tires are headed. This recommendation probably seems a little backward to most drivers. The action, actually, will straighten the vehicle's course of direction. Remember to keep your movements smooth and gentle. Jerking the steering wheel will only make things worse.
Compensate for overcompensation. Sometimes the back end of the vehicle will come back around the other side of the automobile. This does not mean that you did anything wrong in your first action. To correct this, turn the steering wheel a little the new direction of the back of the vehicle, opposite your initial turn.
Repeat turning the steering wheel in the direction of the slide until the vehicle straightens out and/or comes to a stop.;
,


Press lightly and steadily on the brakes of a car with an anti-lock braking system. Do not slam on the brakes as this will increase the intensity and unpredictability of the skid.
Pump the brake pedal of a car without ABS brakes slowly and rhythmically. As the vehicle slows down, you can pump the brakes a little faster.

Find someone with a vehicle powerful enough to tow yours.,
Buy a suitable tow strap.,
Find a suitable place to attach your tow strap.,
Check the brakes, steering, and warning lamps to make sure they are functioning sufficiently for your tow.,
Make an inspection of your towing connections and discuss signalling plans with your tow driver.,
Climb in behind the wheel of the vehicle being towed, disengage the parking brake, and put the vehicle in neutral.,
Have a spotter flag the tow vehicle until the tow line is taut, then release the brake in the vehicle being towed, and prepare to be pulled.

,
Steer in a straight track with the vehicle pulling the towed car.,
Signal turns in the vehicle being towed to let cars behind you know you will be slowing.

",How to Tow Cars," A sedan or small car probably shouldn't be used to tow an SUV or large pickup.;
, In a pinch, a chain can be used to tow a vehicle a short distance, but this can be dangerous, as chains do not stretch, and links can break during towing. A nylon or polyester strap with manufactured end loops is better for safely towing.

, A bumper hitch with a trailer ball will work for the tow vehicle, but hooking to the car to be towed can be tricky, since suspension components are not designed for pulling pressure, and other metal components can cut or pinch your strap. Ideally, a rounded frame member or front bumper support can be used for your attachment, but these vary considerably between vehicles.

, If the vehicle is equipped with power brakes and steering, their use is limited if your engine will not run while being towed. In this case, renting a dolly is a better option.

, Plan an exact route, and try to choose one that avoids congested traffic areas or high speed roads.

, Hold the foot brake lightly to prevent the vehicle from rolling until the slack is taken up from the towing vehicle.

,, Brake slightly if the towing vehicle slows, or starts down a hill where your speed may cause you to begin to overtake him. Slack in the tow line while travelling can result in a serious jolt if the vehicle pulling your speeds up suddenly. By keeping the tow line tight, this risk is greatly reduced.

Exit your parking space.",How to Reverse Into a Car Parking Space1," As you are doing this, turn your turn signal on so that cars behind you know to drive around. The open spot should always be on your right. Never park crossing over to the other side of the street. Your bumper should cover half of the end of the parking space.Make sure to look out for pedestrians before you begin backing up.;
, Turn your wheel all the way to the right before you begin moving the car. Press on the gas gently as your car begins to turn. Because your wheel is all the way to the right, your car will move left when it is in reverse.Continue to look in your mirrors and check for pedestrians and the edges of the cars surrounding the parking space.
Turn your car to the left until your car is parallel with the parking space, equidistant on both sides. After it is parallel, press on the brakes and hold your car steady. Turn your wheel so that your tires are now straight.

, Check your mirrors first to make sure that there is enough room on both sides of the parking space. Do not back up if there are people behind you. Let the brakes go, and gently press on the accelerator with your car still in reverse. Let your car slowly move back into the space.Take it slow. Continuously check the mirrors, and back out, if you are getting too close to one of the cars on the sides.

, Switch between forward and reverse, moving a few inches at a time. Turn your wheel either way. You want the space on both sides of your car to be even. Once your car is safely backed into the space, put your car into park and turn off the engine., Open the driver's door slightly to see whether there is enough room to get out. You may have to hold the door only slightly open as you get out. Make sure not to sling the door open, otherwise you could damage the car behind you. Once you are out, lock your car and you are good to go., Turn your car on and put it in forward. Go forward slightly as you press on the accelerator. As you begin to creep out of your parking space, tilt your head forward to make sure there are no cars or pedestrians coming by. Continue out of the space straight until your bumper is fully past the cars on either side.Turn your wheel whatever direction you want to go and press on the accelerator.

Check the position.,Reverse back into the side road for approximately three car lengths.",How to Reverse Around a Sharp Corner," Ideally this would be at least two to three car lengths pass the side road. This is important due to the following reasons:

If too near the junction you could obscure observations from approaching traffic to the junction
It could be confusing to other road users.
You might be breaking a rule of the UK Highway Code, which states 10 metres approximately.It gives you both the space and time to analyze the road and look out for any hazards;
, Observations prior to reversing are very important. Make sure you complete the following:

Check all around the car prior to moving, also known as a 360-degree check.
Watch out particularly for motorcycles and pedestrians.
Let all approaching traffic pass you prior to starting your reverse parking exercise.
Final check of your right-blind spot to make sure there are no hazards.

, Make sure you follow this guidance:

Reverse back until you can see the side road in your rear passenger side window; or stop when your back passenger tyre is in line with the straight edge of the new road you are about to reverse into.

, Re-do all of your observation checks., As you are reversing around a sharp corner or more commonly known as a 90-degree corner, you should steer a full turn to the left or a full left lock of the steering wheel. The quicker and further you steer, the sooner your tyres will turn the car around the sharp bend., Whilst maneuvering back, you should always check your road position carefully and ensure you are on course of the kerb (curb). The following will help you:

Make sure you are approximately 1 foot from the kerb (curb).
Following the contour of the curve.
Make sure you are not swinging out wide and obstructing the other lane.

Know what to do in the event the front wheels begin to slide.",How to Recover From Loss of Traction2,"


Take your foot off the gas. Put the vehicle in neutral. This will allow the car to gradually slow down. Put the vehicle back in an appropriate gear once the vehicle regains traction.
Refrain from steering the vehicle. The skidding of the tires will help the vehicle slow down. As the vehicle slows, the car will pick up traction again. As the vehicle slows down, turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the vehicle to go.

You will also want to check for fire hydrants, yellow edges on sidewalks, or handicap signs as to why the space might be left empty., This will allow other cars behind you to drive around. Pull up next to the car in front of the empty spot. You want to be as close to the other car as possible, not more than 12 inches (30.5 cm) away. Ensure that the front of your car is the same distance from the car next to you as the back of your car (don't slant your car at an angle). Your bumper should line up directly parallel to the car next to you., Start backing up slowly until your head is parallel with the wheel of the car to your right.

Keep backing up until you can see the front wheel of the car behind you in your right mirror.Your car should now be positioned at a 45 degree angle into the parking space. Press on your brake and steady your car.

, Do this while maintaining your foot on the brake. When it has moved as far as it will go, begin backing up again slowly. Glance from front to back to ensure that you are not going to bump the car in front or the car in back., If you either bump into the curb, or get too close to the car in back of you, turn the top of the wheel to the right again and pull forward slowly. Steer your car into the proper position., Leave space in front and behind to allow yourself and the other people to get out of the parking spots. If you park very far forward or back and another car parks very close to you, you will be too tight to get out of your spot, so don’t forget to leave that space.

Get a copy of your state's driver's manual.,
Find online tests.Some online practice exams even have apps, so you can practice questions on your phone.Driversprep and practicepermittest are good sources for online tests.,
Make flashcards.,
Take a Drivers' Education class.,
Be mindful when riding in the car.,
Choose a day to take your test.,
Get a good night’s sleep and eat a hearty breakfast.,
Get all your paperwork together before hand.,
Stay calm.,
Take your time.,
Keep your perspective.",How to Pass Your Permit Test," Usually the driver’s manual can be found online; you don’t need a physical copy.It may look daunting, but it does have all the information you need.


Read through the “Rules of the Road” section of the manual. Take notes if anything strikes you as surprising.
Reading the manual alone is not enough to help you study for the test. Read through the manual first. Then, take a few practice tests, notating which kinds of questions you got wrong. Then go back to your driver’s manual and read the chapters pertaining to those questions.;
,


Take all available tests. Even if there are repeat questions, it’s still a good idea to take and re-take all tests until you get each question right.
Driving-tests has multiple tests for each state. It may seem excessive, but you have no way of knowing what will be on your final test. Take all of the tests.
You can also search for tests yourself on google. Just make sure to include the name of your state when you search!

, Writing is the best way to memorize information. If you are taking practice tests and getting stuck on certain questions, write down the questions and their answers. Then, make flashcards of them and quiz yourself just on questions that you missed.


You can take flashcards with you and do them on the bus or in a study hall.

, These classes are often not mandatory; however, they cover all the necessary information in the driver’s manual in a more interactive way.


If drivers' education is too expensive or inaccessible, reading and understanding the manual will get you the same results.

, Pay attention to what drivers are doing and what signs are on the road. If something happens that you don’t understand, ask the driver to explain what happened and what rules came into play.


When the car is at an intersection, turning, or merging, try to think of what you would do next in that situation. If the driver does something different, ask them why.

, This way, you are not in a rush or taken by surprise. Make sure that you have a ride to and from the DMV.


When choosing a time, try to pick an odd time (the morning of a weekday, during working hours, etc.) so that the DMV branch will be the least crowded. This will lead to shorter wait times, which should reduce your stress level.

, You can’t think clearly if you are fighting off fatigue. A good night’s sleep is eight hours. A good breakfast has a lot of protein, so eat meat, eggs, or soy protein.Remember to stay hydrated as well.

, Check the DMV website to see what documents your state requires. You can also check other websites to see what most states require. It is most likely that you will need forms of ID like a birth certificate and social security number. You may need proof that you are in school, but it varies state to state, so be sure to double check.

, While you're waiting, remember to breathe. Look through your flashcards or driver’s manual a last time. Smile at the people at the DMV. If you are friendly, they will be friendly as well, which should help you relax.


Sit or stand tall, with your shoulders back. Sitting confidently will actually increase so-called “confidence hormones”, which will make taking the test easier. , The time limits are usually excessive. It will be more valuable to think about your options than to rush. Read each question completely before answering.


You can always come back to questions that you couldn’t understand at the time.

, Plenty of people fail their permit tests, but they become drivers eventually.If you fail your test, you can always re-take it.


Take note of the questions you get stuck on, so that you do not repeat your mistakes.

Find a parking space not surrounded by many cars.,
Position your car.,
Signal when you have found a parking space.,
Turn the wheel sharply.,
Straighten out your wheels.",How to Park in a Parking Lot1," It will be easier to practice parking with fewer obstacles in your way.


When you are practicing, you will want to do this in a parking lot that isn't crowded.
As you are learning, you might make mistakes.
In an area with no cars, you are unlikely to hit anything as you practice your parking skills.
This isn't just a good idea for people learning how to drive. If you haven't driven in a long time, it is a good idea to practice parking and driving a little bit before going long distances.;
, You want your vehicle to be in the right spot, away from other cars and the right distance from your spot so you can cut your wheel correctly. 








Make sure there is at least 5 or 6 feet between your vehicle and any other parked cars.
If there aren't any cars in the spaces near you, try to judge a 5 or 6 foot distance away from them.
This is so that when you are parking, you can use the rest of the steps for cutting your wheel correctly.

, This will let other drivers know you are going to park. 








Drive forward slowly until you see the center of the parking space you want to use.
Be aware of other drivers. Don't take a space someone else has been waiting for.
Make sure there is no one trying to back-out of a nearby spot as you are driving forward.

, You should do this once you see the center of the parking space. 








Make sure your car is still about 5-6 feet from any other cars or empty parking spaces as you begin to turn.
You will want to turn the wheel about a half of a turn.
Make sure there are no carts or other objects in the space.
Move forward slowly into the space. Come to a full stop when your car is in the spot the whole way.
Make sure your car is in the spot entirely to avoid getting a ticket.

, You can do this once your car is stopped.









You want to make sure your wheels are straight so you can back out of your spot straight.
You can also straighten out your wheels just before you back out.
However, it is best practice to do this when you park.

"
"
Position your car.,
Turn on your signal.,
Turn your wheel sharply.,
Pull into the space.,
Straighten out your wheels.",How to Park in a Parking Lot2," You will want to be far enough away from other cars in the parking lot to be able to turn into a spot. Make sure your car is at least 8 feet away from any other parked vehicles on the driver's side or passenger's side.
This will depend on if your parking space is on the left or right of your car.
If there aren't any cars parked near you, try to judge an 8 foot distance from the spaces to your car.
Don't take someone else's parking spot that they have been waiting for.

, This will let other drivers know you are going to park in a free space. Take a quick look for any cars, pedestrians, or other obstacles.
Move forward slowly.
Drive forward until the front bumper of your car is just past the taillights of the car next to your parking space.

, You will need to turn a little bit more sharply than if you were parking in an angled space. 








Begin to do this as your front bumper passes the taillights of the car in the parking space next to yours.
Drive forward slowly.
Make sure there aren't any shopping carts, debris, or objects in the space as you pull in.

, Do this until the front of your car is at the back of the space and the rear of your car is entirely in the space.









A good way to do this is to align your side mirrors with those on the car beside you.
Make sure your front bumper isn't creeping into the space in front of you.
Check to make sure the rear side of your car isn't sticking out of the parking space.

, Do this after your car is entirely in the parking space. 








Your wheels will need to be straight when you back out of your spot.
You can also do this when you are leaving your spot before you start to reverse.
It is best practice to do this right after parking, however.

"
"
Seek out a space.,
Check your mirrors.,
Line up your car.,
Put your vehicle in reverse.,
Release your brakes and cut your wheel all the way to the right.,
Turn the steering wheel to the left.,
Shift into drive.",How to Park in a Parking Lot3," This will need to be one you are comfortable with getting your car into without hitting the person in front of you or behind you. 








Some parking lots have parallel spaces. These are usually marked clearly with white lines, so it can be easier to park in these than on the street.
If you need to, drive around the block until you find a space with a large enough gap.
You will need a space several feet longer than your car.
Larger spaces are easier to park in.

, Do this as you approach your spot. Ensure another car isn't riding on your tail.
Signal towards the space as you approach, slow down, then stop.
If another motorist pulls up behind you, maintain your position. Roll down your window and gesture for them to go around you, if possible.

, You will do this with the car in front of your space, maintaining at least a 2 foot distance between the side of your car and the one in front. Don't get too close or too far away from the car. If you are too close you might scrape the other vehicle as you are backing into your space.
Try to be about 2 feet away from the other vehicle.
Align your car's bumper with the other vehicles bumper or stay 2-3 feet behind it.

, You will now be backing into the space. 








Check your driver's side mirror to make sure the street behind you is free of traffic.
Look over your other shoulder to check the space.
Back up until your bumper is about 3-4 feet behind that of the car next to you.

, You will begin to back slowly into the space. 








Visually check in front of and around your car frequently. Make sure other cars or pedestrians don't cross your path.
Maintain a distance of 2-3 feet between the side of your car and the car in front of you to avoid scraping it.
Use your mirrors to judge the distance between your back bumper and the car behind you.
If you hit the curb, you've gone too far. In that case, switch gears into drive and pull forward a few feet.

, Do this once your front wheels are next to the back bumper of the car in front. 








You should still be in reverse.
Continue in reverse as far back as you can.
Look forward and to the side to make sure you aren't hitting the car in front.
Don't hit the bumper of the car behind you.
Look through your back window to check how far the car behind you is from your rear bumper. You can also use your side and rear view mirrors to help you.

, You will now position your car in the space. 








Turn your steering wheel to the right again.
Move slowly forward towards the curb. As you do this, straighten your car in the space.
Use your passenger side mirror to check your distance from the curb. You should be within one foot (30cm) of the curb when you are done parking.
You should now be completely parked.

Park in a well-lit area.,
Choose an area that has people around.,
Find a legal spot.,
Make sure your vehicle will be visible.,
Avoid parking at the end of a row.,
Be prepared to pay.",How to Park Safely1," If you are parking at night, be sure to park in a well-lit area that is as close to your destination as possible. Look around for any dangerous looking people nearby. If you feel unsafe, don't park there. Just keep on driving and consider coming back another day during daylight hours.You could also look for a different parking lot or a parking garage that has better lighting. Or you can go to a well-lit store, like Walmart, that has lots of lighting and built-in security.;
, If you park your car off the beaten path, it will be more of a target. Choose a place where there will be people walking around. Look for an area where other cars are parked as well., Make sure the place you wish to park is a designated parking area. Look for any signs that might indicate otherwise, such as a No Parking sign. Look for printed lines on the pavement that indicate that a spot is for parking.Never park in a handicap spot unless your car has a handicap symbol on its license plate or rearview mirror.
Never park on a sidewalk or in front of a fire hydrant.
Never block a driveway or park too close to an intersection
Never park where you will block the flow of traffic.

, This will help to prevent crime. Many parking lots and garages have security cameras. Make sure your car is clearly seen from several angles. Avoid parking next to a large truck or in between two vehicles that block the line of sight to your car., Your car will be more likely to be hit by cars driving by if it is at the very end of the row. Especially avoid parking after the end of the row in a crowded area. For example, if the lot is full, cars will sometimes make their own space next to the last designated parking spot. But this is ill-advised because your car will be more likely to get hit, get ticketed, or even get towed because it isn’t a legal spot.Avoid parking next to a cart storage area at a grocery store. Your car might get a dent from a cart.

, Some parking garages or city streets require payment to park there. Take note of this as you are choosing a spot and be sure you have the money to pay. Sometimes you will need to pay ahead of time, like with a parking meter, and other times you will pay when you leave, like when leaving a parking garage. It’s never fun to pay for parking, but it’s much less fun to get a ticket or get your car towed!


Sometimes you can pay by credit card, but other times it requires cash or coins. Be sure you have the appropriate payment method available.

Park in the lines provided on the parking space.,
Park as close as possible to the curb on a road.,
Use your car’s safety brake when you park on a hill.,
Know how to park in all situations.,
Use safe parking technology.",How to Park Safely2," Observe its activity. Drive slowly and pay attention to other vehicles and pedestrians., A pedestrian could walk in front of you or another car could back up. This is why it is important to move slowly and proceed with great caution.

, Do not check your phone or turn around to look at your kids while parking. 20% of accidents occur in parking lots, so it is important that parking have your undivided attention. Once your car is safely in its spot, you can deal with anything else., Don’t try to squeeze your car into a tight space because you could hit the car beside you, ding their door, or they could hit your car. Look for a spot that will allow for at least two feet on both sides of your vehicle.If there aren’t too many cars in the parking lot, leave a few spaces between you and other cars.

, Stop your car 6 to 8 ft away from the spot. Slowly come to a halt and turn on your turn signal for 3 seconds when coming to your spot. This will show other cars that you are turning and will give you a chance to check the area around you for traffic and pedestrians. Only begin to move into your parking space after you have carefully looked at the area around you and signaled to other drivers that you will be parking., Carefully position your vehicle within the given space. Make sure your vehicle is in the middle of the space and not too close to either line.


If you have an over-sized vehicle, then consider taking up multiple spaces so that your vehicle is not in the lane of the parking lot. This is a problem with many larger trucks and SUVs. You could park in additional spaces by parking perpendicular to the parking spots.

, Anytime you are parking on a street rather than in a parking lot, be sure to pull over as far as possible. This is especially important when parallel parking. Try to park as close to the curb as you can so that your vehicle will not be hit by cars driving by.If it is a busy road, exit your vehicle on the passenger side of the car rather than into traffic.

, This will keep your car from rolling. You should also turn your tires diagonally so that it won’t move. When parking uphill, turn your front tires away from the curb; when parking downhill, turn your front tires towards the curb., You should be comfortable parking at an angle, parallel parking, and reversing your car into a parking spot. There are situations where these skills will be necessary, so be sure to practice ahead of time.To get comfortable with these skills, you could go to an empty parking lot and practice. If the parking lot doesn’t have these types of parking spots, you could set up your own with cones.
For parallel parking and reverse parking, it is especially important to check all of your mirrors and your blind spot to ensure you won’t hit any cars or pedestrians.

, Cars are starting to come with tools to help you park safely. If your car has technology like a Blind Spot Warning System, Reverse Monitoring System, or an Intelligent Parking System, make use of these. They can help you to safely pull in and out of your parking spot without hitting anything. Be sure to heed their warnings and respond accordingly."

Remove valuables from your car.,
Open your vehicle's doors carefully.,
Lock your car securely.,
Supervise young children as they exit the vehicle.,
Reverse your car carefully.",How to Park Safely3," This will help to prevent theft and break ins. If you leave money or your purse or laptop on the seat, this will tempt people to steal it. Your car should look boring and like there is nothing of value inside., Be careful not to hit another person's vehicle with your door as you exit your vehicle. You can make this much easier by leaving enough space in between you and the cars next to you.

, Make sure that all doors and the trunk are locked after you leave. This will protect your car.If your car has a security system, be sure to activate it. It will sound if anyone attempts to break in.

, Accompany them by either carrying them, pushing a stroller or holding their hand as you leave the car. They will need help safely navigating the parking lot.

, To pull out of the parking spot, you may need to reverse your car. Be sure to reverse your car very slowly and only after checking your mirrors and your blindspot. To reverse, turn your head around and look behind you while maneuvering your vehicle. Wait to begin turning your car out of the space until the front of your car is out of the spot so that you don’t hit the car to your side.Driving in reverse is when many accidents occur and when you are most likely to hit a pedestrian.
When reversing, you do not have the right of way! Let other cars and pedestrians move first.
Use your turn signal to show which way you will be pulling out. Signal for at least 3 seconds.

Put your blinker on.,
Reduce your speed to 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph).,
Check for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, and other vehicles.,
Turn into the right lane.","How to Make Right, Left, and U Turns1"," Turn it on 100 feet (30 meters) or one whole city block before the turn. As you approach the turn, drive closer to the right side of the street. This will signal to cars that you are preparing to turn ahead., Do this by placing your foot on the brake pedal. As you reduce your speed, glance at your rear view and right-hand mirror to see if the cars behind you are slowing down.If you notice that the cars behind you are not slowing down, tap your break pedal a couple times to signal that you are breaking.

, Do this by looking into your right-hand mirror and by looking back over your right shoulder. Once your path is clear, make the right turn by turning your steering wheel to the right., Not the left lane if you are turning into a two-lane street. Try to make your turn as tight as possible without hitting the curb. In other words, do not make a wide, sweeping turn. Making wide turns may cause you to go into the lanes of oncoming traffic.Do not make a right turn from a left lane.

"
"
Pay attention to the road signs.,
Turn on your blinker.,
Come to a complete stop and yield to oncoming traffic.,
Turn left once the oncoming lanes are clear.","How to Make Right, Left, and U Turns2"," You want to do this because left turns aren’t always allowed. If you see a sign saying that a left turn is illegal, then keep driving until you can make a legal left turn.For example, some traffic lights and intersections prohibit left turns.

, Do this at least 100 feet (30 meters) before the actual turn. As you approach the turn, reduce your speed to 10 to 15 miles per hour (16 to 24 kph) by pressing the break pedal. Get as close to the centerline or median as possible.Use the center left lane if one is available to make your left turn.
Do not attempt to make a left turn from a right lane.

, As you are yielding, keep your wheels straight by holding your steering wheel straight. If your wheels are slightly turned to the left while waiting, you may be shoved into oncoming traffic if a car hits you from behind., As a rule of thumb, do not turn if oncoming vehicles are less than 200 feet (60 meters) away from you. Once the lanes are clear, you may turn into either the left or right-hand lane if you are turning into a two-lane street.If you are turning into a single-lane street, make sure to not cut the corner of the oncoming traffic’s lane. In other words, do not make your left turn too tight.

"
"
Check for signs prohibiting U-turns.,
Turn your left signal on and reduce your speed.,
Turn you steering wheel to the left as far as you can.,
Avoid making illegal U-turns.","How to Make Right, Left, and U Turns3"," You may make U-turns only if you are crossing a double yellow line, there is a “U-turn Only” sign, you are in a residential area, and if you are in the far left lane and no sign is prohibiting U-turns.You may also make a U-turn on a divided highway if there is an opening in the center divider and the opening is not reserved for law enforcement or emergency vehicles.

, Once you approach your turn, get as close to the centerline of the road as possible and come to a complete stop. Observe the traffic and check for oncoming vehicles and motorcycles, as well as pedestrians and bicycles.Oncoming vehicles must be more than 200 feet (60 meters) away before making a U-turn.
Do not make a U-turn from the right lane.

, Do this to prepare for the U-turn. Once the lanes are clear, slightly accelerate and let the steering wheel correct itself to a straight position. Then turn into the left lane.Do not turn into the far right lane.

, U-turns are prohibited when there is a “No U-turn” sign, you are on a one-way street, and when you cannot see 200 feet (60 meters) in either direction (because of hills, curves, rain, snow, fog, and other obstacles).Additionally, do not make U-turns on highways that are split by curbs, two sets of double yellow lines, and other dividing mechanisms.

Slow down as you approach the roundabout.,
Look to your left before entering the roundabout and yield to any oncoming traffic.,
When there is a safe gap in traffic, enter the roundabout.,
Engage your turn signal as you approach your desired exit.,
Yield only to pedestrians in the crosswalk or emergency vehicles when exiting a roundabout.",How to Navigate a Roundabout1," At this point, you should see a ""Roundabout Ahead"" sign followed by a ""Yield"" sign. The recommended speed is normally 15 - 20 mph (24 - 32 kph).;
, Traffic already in the roundabout has the right-of-way. Do not enter unless a safe gap is present. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter the roundabout without yielding.Crosswalks are placed one or two car-lengths before the roundabout itself. Yield to any pedestrians who are in, or about to enter, the crosswalk.

, Maintain a low speed as you maneuver through the roundabout and proceed to your exit.

, This will inform other drivers that you wish to exit the roundabout, easing confusion.

, Remember that drivers inside the roundabout have the right-of-way. Unless a pedestrian is crossing the crosswalk or an emergency vehicle, such as an ambulance, is entering or exiting the roundabout, proceed through the exit without stopping or slowing down.


If an emergency vehicle is about to enter or has already entered the roundabout, do not stop in the roundabout. Instead, exit out your original destination and only then pull over.

"
"
Remember to yield to both lanes of traffic in a multi-lane roundabout.If you know you'll be turning right, and hence staying in the rightmost lane, but you see an oncoming car in the left lane, wait for it to pass before entering the roundabout.,
Choose which lane to enter based on which direction you want to exit.,
Never drive next to, or attempt to pass, a large vehicle or truck on a multi-lane roundabout.,
Stay in your lane at all times.,
Never, ever stop in the middle of a roundabout.,
Navigate the roundabout as a cyclist.,
Navigate the roundabout as a pedestrian.",How to Navigate a Roundabout2," Although frowned on, the car could merge into your lane just as you are entering the roundabout, causing an accident.

, In multi-lane roundabouts, which usually have three or more possible exits, the lane you choose to drive in is dictated by the kind of turn you want to make:


Occupy the left lane if you decide to turn left, make a U-turn, or go straight.
Occupy the right lane if you deice to turn run or go straight.
Look for signs indicating the allowed movements for each lane. These signs are usually located above or alongside the road and/or arrows painted on the road itself.

, Large trucks have a larger turning radius, making them one of the more dangerous obstacles in a roundabout. Always give them ample room to turn by staying behind them a bit more than you ordinarily would with passenger vehicles.

, Never change lanes while in a multi-lane roundabout.

, A roundabout is like an intersection, through which traffic is continuously flowing. Stopping in the middle of a roundabout will cause congestion and increase the likelihood of an accident.

, If you are cycling through a roundabout, you have two options:


Enter the roundabout as if you were a vehicle. Remain centered in your lane to be most visible and avoid being cut off by other vehicles.
If you are uncomfortable riding your bicycle through the roundabout, exit the roadway and use the crosswalks.

, If you wish to cross the roundabout as a pedestrian, follow these steps:


Look to your left and cross when there is a safe gap in traffic.
Stop when you reach the splitter island.
Look to your right and cross when there is a safe gap in traffic.

, On an automatic transmission lightly touch the brake with your left foot, while keeping the right foot over the throttle.

,, Hold the safety button with your thumb at the same time. Continue steering until your steering wheel is locked. This is much easier on cars equipped with power steering, as you have to steer using only one hand.

, This is perceived as a moment of weightlessness.

, If you release the handbrake first, your car will stop spinning and start turning normally, possibly hitting the curb or driving off the road!

Install the following parts for the ideal drifting car.",How to Make a Car Spin4,"

Lowered and hardened suspension (sport springs, sports shocks) never cut springs!
Rear camber set to full positive
Front camber set to full negative
Brake bias set to neutral (front and rear axle brake at the same time with the same force). In passenger cars and light cargo vans the brake bias is set to front with the purpose of avoiding a drift during in-turn braking
Handbrake actuator cable with no slack
High engine power (over 100 hp). Gasoline engine (diesels are slow and clumsy)
No ECU (Electronic Control Unit,). The absence of an ECU excludes such control aids as the ESP or traction control. You cannot drift a car with any of them
Rear wheel drive
Manual transmission
LSD (Limited Slip Differential) or any other automatically locking differential
No ABS
Power steering (for beginners; pros use direct steering for better control and feedback)
Worn out narrow tires in the back and wide new tires in front
Disc brakes on the rear wheels (drum brakes tend to slip and overheat more easily)
Long wheelbase. With LWB cars you get better control during the drift/spin

Consider the reasons that cars backfire.,
Start your vehicle.,
Turn the engine off again, with your foot on the gas pedal.,
Wait a few seconds, then restart the car.",How to Make a Car Backfire1," While backfiring can be done manually with relative ease in old cars, it's important you have an understanding of what backfiring is, and what causes it. A misplaced spark or unexpected burst of fuel or air will cause a loud burst from the engine. While modern cars come equipped with systems to regulate these aspects via an Engine Control Unit (ECU), older cars (roughly before 1990) are far more malleable. It's important to keep in mind the reasons why regulating systems were installed in the first place. Excessive backfiring is very unhealthy for your vehicle, and can ultimately result in having to replace parts.;
, Bring it to a steady rev. Prepare the vehicle as you regularly would. Normal safety checks (including dripping oil) are much more important here, as you'll be charging an open flame.


The location in which you do this must be open, and relatively free of things that might get caught by the flame. This includes anyone who may be watching. Keep that at a healthy distance-- around 10 meters (33 ft) should be good.

, This will prep your car for some backfiring. Ideally, you don't want to start moving fast while you're turning on the engine, so keep the pressure light.

, Keep your foot on the gas pedal as it starts up. Once it's up, press the accelerator down as hard as you can. This should cause the car to backfire.

Be aware that your car may already backfire.,
Equip your vehicle accordingly.,
Install a new ECU input.,
Access and change the injection rates in the ECU.",How to Make a Car Backfire2," Some modern sports cars actually backfire intentionally when it comes time to decelerate. This is mostly done to add to the car's presence and bravado. Considering it is much more difficult to properly backfire a more recent model, you might want to exploit the existing opportunities. Try decelerating after hitting a decent (~60mph) speed, and see if you can hear it. Better still, get a friend to watch the exhaust as you drive and decelerate. , Modern cars (roughly after 1990) require more tweaking before they can backfire safely. Because the ECU is there as a failsafe against backfiring, the chassis of the car isn't designed to normally withstand it. A sturdier exhaust port (such as the Tomei Type 80) will minimize damage to the car's body.

, Depending on the model of car, there should be a port With a Flash Tune Kit (or something along the lines of it) hooked up to your car, you'll be able to modify the ECU software directly. Changing (or 'modding') the ECU software will change the times and rates in which fuel is injected. Unfortunately ECU modding hardware and software is fairly expensive, and might put you back over $1000 dollars. Keep in mind ECU mods are often specific to certain models, so you might have to do some searching before you find one that suits yours. , This is where it comes tricky, as it requires you have an existing knowledge of your vehicle's specifications. You want to figure out what engine RPM you want for your car to start backfiring. If you just want the roar and pop of a backfire, choose an RPM to cut all fuel. Input a higher number for a given RPM if you want the flames. It goes without saying that adding extra fuel is more dangerous; if you're relatively new to this, it's recommended you experiment with the safer route first.


Although the particulars will vary depending on the model of car and type of ECU kit, generally speaking, you will want to access the input and cut fuel intake at the RPM you'd like your car to pop at. If you're using a Flash Tune Kit, for example, input the given RPM intake as the most negative integer the system will accept. Input these negative integers (e.g. -15 etc.) to encompass the range of a couple hundred RPMs. This will essentially 'trick' your engine into popping.
Entering a number incorrectly could inadvertently destroy your car. It is not recommended you even consider doing this without some expertise in motorworks.

Repeat as needed.",How to Merge with Heavy Traffic," Pay attention to where cars are most heavily concentrated. Perhaps traffic is heaviest in one lane. Be aware of the cars around you while you are driving. This will make merging much easier and will allow you to plan your merge accordingly. Pay special attention to the lane you want to merge into.Don't leave this until the last minute or you may cause an accident because you have to rush your merging steps.;
, Check the traffic for gaps in which you can strategically merge your vehicle into. You need a gap that is at least twice the length of your car, preferably three to four car lengths if moving at high speeds.If traffic is very heavy and there aren’t any adequate gaps, you may need to signal to a driver to let you over. In this case, try pointing into their lane with your finger to show that you need to get over. Only do this if you are moving very slowly. If traffic is almost stopped, you could even roll down your window and ask to be let over.

, Keep at least a two to three second gap between you and the car in front of you if possible. This is especially important when entering onto a freeway. This will allow both you and the car in front of you to merge without having to slow down. The gap will make the merge smooth for all cars so that you can alternate entering into the lane next to you., When cars make use of all available lanes, this avoids congesting a single lane and will help traffic move smoothly. For example, if a lane is closing on a highway and there is a sign indicating this, many people will immediately try to move over. But this slows traffic significantly. It is better for the flow of traffic for drivers to wait and use both lanes right until the lane is about to close and then merge., Make a habit of checking your mirror every time you change busy traffic lanes or every ten seconds when not changing lanes. This will help you to be aware of the cars around you and avoid accidents. Check the mirrors first to get an idea of what is going on behind you, and then check them right before you merge.This includes your rearview mirror and your side mirrors. Take a quick glance at each periodically to get a good view of traffic behind you.

, Don't forget to signal so that the drivers around you will know that you intend on changing lanes. Don't leave this until the last minute. You want the drivers to have enough time to see and react to your signal. Don't assume that the second you turn the signal on, they will notice it, and you can merge., Make sure you are going the same speed as the drivers in the lane you wish to enter. Speed up when necessary. You want to go with the flow of traffic. It is your responsibility as the car that will merge to match their speed. They don’t need to match yours.Try to avoid slowing down unless absolutely necessary because slowing down when merging is a factor that can cause accidents. The only reason to slow down would be to match the speed of the other cars.Accelerate gradually if you are merging into heavy traffic from an access ramp, and make sure that you are at a safe distance from both the car in front and behind you. Use the acceleration lane to build your speed to match the speed of traffic.

, If the car narrows the gap between them and the car in front of them, they probably don’t want you to enter. In either case, it is better not to force it or you could cause an accident. Instead, wait until you find a car that is maintaining a gap that will allow you to merge.Some drivers might even wave their hand at you, motioning for you to enter, or flash their lights at you. This means they are inviting you to merge. You can wave politely to them when they let you over.

, Turn your head and quickly glance at your blind spot directly behind your shoulder (on the side to which you will merge) before merging. This should be the last thing you do before changing lanes. It is important to do this because a car could be there that you weren’t able to see in your mirrors. This important step will help you to avoid accidents., Since merging is dangerous, a common inclination is to slow down to try to merge cautiously. But this has the opposite effect. Instead of making a merge safer, it actually makes it more dangerous. Maintain the speed of traffic at all times. Unless traffic is at a standstill, you should never need to stop in order to merge. By planning ahead of time, you should be able to avoid this., Make sure that you can merge. Don’t cross a solid white line. Make sure there is a single dashed line to show that you can change lanes. Make sure you are obeying speed limits as well., It is the responsibility of the merger to yield to other cars, not the other way around. They have the right of way and you need to adjust to them accordingly. The onus is on you to avoid any collisions or accidents. When in doubt, don’t risk it. Find a good gap to enter in., When merging onto a highway, you often have over 15 seconds to merge. This is plenty of time and means that you don’t have to rush. If there isn’t a gap right away, you can adjust your speed to find one. You don’t need to panic if a merge isn’t able to happen immediately., Ease over to the next lane once you have determined that it is safe to do so. Allow the car to merge at a relaxed pace, but don’t linger. It should only take about four seconds. Do not turn the wheel abruptly to rush into a space as this may alarm other drivers, causing them to make sudden maneuvers for fear that you might hit them. You could also lose control of your vehicle if you turn too quickly. Therefore it is best to merge smoothly.If drivers have made a gap to allow you to enter, you need to begin to merge within 2-3 seconds of them letting you in or they will likely close the gap.

, Remember to turn off your indicator signal once you have completed your merge. If not, the drivers around you will assume you are moving to the next lane over. Don't forget that others drivers cannot read your mind and that your signal is your communication tool., Once you have merged, make sure to allow space between you and the cars around you. If your merge was tight due to heavy traffic, try to slow down slightly to allow a greater space to form between you and the car ahead of you. Then resume moving at the speed of traffic., Once you have completed your merge, if you see another car intending to merge, let them in. It can be tempting, if you are in a hurry, to speed up and not let other cars in, but you won’t save very much time and you could even cause an accident. Even if you think someone is cutting in line, it is better to just let them in.To let other cars merge, simply slow down slightly to leave a sufficient gap for them to enter in.

, Follow these same steps if you plan on moving into another lane. Do not cross more than one lane at a time. Each merge should be completed with great care because this is the time when an accident is most likely, especially when traffic is heavy."

Keep your right foot on the brake pedal and your left on the the clutch pedal

Slowly lift your left foot off the clutch.

Press down the brake firmly and smoothly.,
Don't brake and swerve the car at the same time.,
Avoid using your transmission for quick stops.,
Focus on where you want to go, not what you want to avoid.",How to Brake and Stop a Car in the Shortest Distance1," If you push your foot down on the pedal in a car with ABS, you will feel the brake pulsating under your foot, sometimes violently. Don't be afraid of this or let go -- that just means the brakes are doing their job. Depress your brake pedal with rapidly, but not instantly. This is essential to maximize the braking potential of your car. The goal is to bring the vehicle's tires just shy of breaking traction. It is important, though, to avoid ""squeezing"" down on the brakes if your car has ABS.









The key is to apply the brakes quickly and deeply, while applying pressure with the left foot against the footrest to stabilize the body.
As the car's speed is being scrubbed off, you can progressively and gently ease off of the brakes to keep them at the point of maximal efficiency.;
, Gentle turning while braking can help you avoid a collision. However, don't ever swerve or jerk the steering wheel, as this can cause the vehicle to go out of control. It is not uncommon for people to swerve to miss a small animal and end up colliding with a tree or another car. In some circumstances, such as if a child jumps in front of your car, it is prudent to turn while you apply your brakes. You should practice this in a safe environment so you'll get an idea of how the vehicle will react. Here are some different ways to brake your car:









Brake-turning. Turning the wheel into the corner while still lightly on the brakes. This causes the car to lean forward, pressing the front tires to the ground, giving them more grip for steering. This a basic technique, and no corner should be made without it.

Trail braking. This is a method of feathering the brakes while turning into the corner and it will provide the best and safest control over the vehicle as it is leaning on the front tires, allowing for more traction to those tires.

An emergency stop. If a need to stop quickly is due, you should not fear using the brakes, even mid-corner: With ABS, depress the pedal all the way down. Without ABS, brake moderately hard (70%) while taking off a bit of steering.

, The transmission is design to accelerate the vehicle not slow it down. The design of the load points on the transmission gears are not designed for this. It is not a component of the braking system. If you operate a tractor trailer, it is a different story. They are equipped with air brakes and engine brake for a reason that is irrelevant for cars. However, it is a good practice to use engine braking for maintaining or decreasing speed on long downhill stretches.









The heat generated is absorbed by the engine and removed efficiently by its coolant, radiator, and fan, which prevents the brakes from overheating so they will be most effective when needed for maximum braking.

, It's very difficult to steer away from something that you're looking at directly, and many people have a tendency to focus on what they are worried about colliding with. Instead, concentrate on where you want the car to go (to the side of the object) and pay attention to how the car feels—whether you're at OSP or locking up.

""Squeeze"" the brakes.,
Brake at the limit before the brakes lock up.,
Don't look at the object that you are colliding with.,
Press your left foot against the floor.,
Practice threshold braking.",How to Brake and Stop a Car in the Shortest Distance2," If your car does not have ABS, then you shouldn't hit or slam the brakes. Instead, you should squeeze the brake pedal firmly with your foot to stop the car as quickly as possible. You should squeeze the pedal down until right before the tires begin to skid, which will reach the limit of the traction of the tires. If you push down on the pedal too hard, you will lock the brakes and will lose control of your vehicle.







, This is called ""threshold braking"" and will make your car stop as quickly as possible. Listen for a faint howl from the tires, which will tell you that you haven't reached the limit and that you're doing the right thing. If the wheel locks up and you've lost control of the car, then you've gone too far and have to let go and reapply the brakes again.







, Look to either side of the object and try to aim the car away from it instead of colliding with the object head on. If you're mesmerized by the object that you're about to hit, then you won't be able to focus on threshold braking, which will require your full concentration.








, Pressing your left foot against the rest pad area will help you brace your body against the damage and will make you for sensitive to knowing how you should modulate the brake pedal.







, It takes time and practice to master this type of braking, and spending some time doing it in an empty parking lot can improve your chances of success if the time ever comes. Also, practicing squeezing the brakes both firmly and lightly in your everyday driving can help you improve your braking skills -- and can save your life when the time comes.









You can measure this by setting up markers as to when to start braking and when you stop the car, and you can visually see the difference between your tires locked up and not.
Extra practice: Purposely lock up your brakes. Now practice reducing pressure on the pedal until it stops locking up, then apply pressure again to the OSP (optimal squeeze point) again. Inevitably, you will go over your OSP, or you will change surfaces while braking, that is why this practice is essential.
Take note: each surface and speed will have different OSPs. This is why you should practice while it is dry, then while it is raining, and then when it is snowy, if it's possible.

Drive consistently.,
Don't impede other traffic.,
When you must drive more slowly than others (looking for an address or when your vehicle is having mechanical difficulty), consider turning on the indicator which is on the side of oncoming traffic.,
Don't tailgate.,
Always check your mirrors and your blind spot before passing as there may be someone else behind you driving at a much higher speed.,
Use your turn signal lights to signal your intentions to other drivers so your actions don't come as a surprise.,
When you need to use the brake to slow down, put your foot on it and decelerate smoothly.,
Accelerate with purpose.,
When pulling into moving traffic, time your move carefully and accelerate quickly so you don't force oncoming drivers to hit their brakes.,
Stop at the stop line, especially at intersections with traffic lights.,
When you are moving into a turn lane in preparation for making a turn, signal your intention, change into the turn lane, then slow down - in that order.,
When driving at speeds under the limit, try to drive as close to the limit as possible., unless conditions demand otherwise (i.e.,
If there is more than one clear lane and you are in the right lane behind someone going a few miles under the limit, do not honk or speed by and cut them off to make a point that they are going too slow.,
When driving on a multi-lane road, do not block other traffic by driving right next to another vehicle at the same speed.,
On freeways and Interstates, Do not drive in the left lane continually unless heavy traffic or upcoming turns/exits demand it.,
Stay out of the blind spots of other vehicles as much as possible, which are generally the right and left rear corners depending on the vehicle.

,
If you inadvertently cause a situation that annoys other drivers, and they honk the horn or indicate their displeasure in some other way, do not gesture wildly, honk your own horn or jam the brakes.,
In heavy highway traffic, pick a lane and stay in it, but not the fast lane.,
If you are on the freeway and it looks like the vehicle next to you is trying to get over, it probably is because they are trying to get over.,
If you are behind someone who is trying to switch lanes, don't try to pass them on that side to crowd them out.,
Recognize that highway on-ramps and off-ramps are there so the flow of traffic will not be interrupted.,
Anticipate highway on-ramp incoming traffic.,
Passing on the right of traffic is very dangerous and also illegal in some places.,
Don't drive with your foot on the brake.",How to Avoid Annoying Other Drivers," Don't speed up and slow down for no reason, don't make one turn fast and the next slow. Consistent driving, whether more aggressive or less, is the best way to allow other drivers to accurately predict what you're going to do next. Additionally drive consistent to the surrounding traffic. By driving inconsistently, you risk the general safety of others around you and you may also risk getting cited for one of many traffic violations.


Recognize that everything works best when traffic flows in a natural, balanced, and predictable way. This is the single most important concept behind not annoying other drivers.;
, For example, if you are on a U.S. Interstate Highway with a speed limit of 65 mph (105 km/h), and the majority of traffic is averaging about 70, don't impede them by driving in the far left lane at 65 mph (105 km/h). Either match their speed or get over to the right lane and get out of their way.


Beware if you attempt to match their speed, you risk at least getting a traffic ticket for speeding and the officer is not likely going to accept the excuse that you were ""just keeping speed with traffic"", especially if you're the lead car. But this does not mean you should endanger yourself by slowing them down and risking a collision. In general, you should drive at or close to the speed limit unless conditions demand that all drivers slow down.

, However, beware that turning on your hazard indicator while your vehicle is moving is unsafe and illegal in some places. If passing is difficult and you're holding up traffic, pull over from time to time to let others get by. They'll thank you for it (or at least will no longer be annoyed).

, Ever. It's completely unnecessary, highly annoying and quite dangerous. Some people will have a psychological reaction to tailgating that will cause them to slow down, and some people will do it just to be mean. In fact, the DMV actually recommends slowing down if being tailgated so as to create a space cushion in case of emergency.


If the vehicle in front is traveling slowly in the passing lane, be patient. Do not flash your headlights while tailgating as this is viewed by many drivers as an act of aggressive driving and very rude. In certain areas of the United States, aggressive actions such as these are monitored by surveillance cameras and ticketed accordingly.
If you have legitimate need to pass and there is only one lane per direction of traffic (i.e. the vehicle in front is going at an excessively slow speed and there is slightly heavy oncoming traffic) and you cannot pass naturally, back off to a safe distance (if you aren't already) and briefly flash your lights (no more than twice should be sufficient). At this point, the driver in the vehicle ahead may understand your intentions better and pull off slightly to allow you to pass with greater ease, if not just continue attempting to pass naturally while not tailgating. If you find yourself catching up to vehicles ahead of you continually, then you're probably going too fast relative to traffic around you.

, Should this be the case, let them pass you first. Once they have passed you, continue to pass the other vehicle as planned should conditions allow you to both pass. Always drive sufficiently faster than the vehicle you overtake and return to the right lane as soon as possible.


Semi trucks have much bigger blind spots. You might think the driver can see you but his vision may be obstructed as the drivers can only use their mirrors to see others on the road.

, Failing to do so can be a source of serious aggravation to other drivers. Signal before you turn, change lanes, merge, or exit the freeway...every time, even when you don't think it's necessary.


If you're on a fast moving road with a fair amount of traffic, turn on your signal much sooner, to let other drivers know you are turning, and to give them ample time to pass.
If you're making a left turn at an intersection, the drivers behind you will appreciate advance warning.
If you need to slow down to make a turn or pull over, use your turn signal before pressing the brake pedal. This will give other drivers advance notice that you'll be slowing down soon.
When you're finished making your turn or lane change, make sure your turn signal is off. If someone is performing a reasonable merge or lane change in front of you (timely and using a turn signal), let them in.

, Frequent tapping of the brake pedal will make drivers around you unsure of whether you're actually stopping. On the other hand, don't brake at the absolute last possible second. Give drivers behind you plenty of time to notice that you're braking and to do likewise. A good time to start braking is when you notice the car in front of the one you're following braking.

, This is not to say you should floor the gas and take off like mad. Just don't dawdle, especially when the light turns green, or when it's your turn at the stop sign. When you are changing lanes, do not slow down unless traffic demands it. In fact, speed up a little bit.

, Be patient and wait for a big opening, then hit it! If the traffic is moving at 60 mph (97 km/h) and it takes you a leisurely 30 seconds to get up to speed, you'll need almost half a mile of empty highway to avoid endangering or irritating other drivers.

, Stopping well short of the line can be confusing to other drivers - is that vehicle stopped for the light or has it broken down? - and you may fail to trigger the sensors that change the traffic lights. Stopping beyond the line won't get you to your destination much faster but it will interfere with other vehicles, especially those trying to turn left onto your street.

, If there are multiple turn lanes, pick one and stay in it all the way throughout the turn. Drifting into an adjacent lane is likely to force another driver to take evasive action.

, that all drivers slow down due to heavy traffic, inclement weather, etc. or speed up due to traffic flow, improved weather conditions, etc). Even if there are passing lanes, stay close to the speed of other vehicles unless there is a real need to go slower. When you must drive more slowly than others (looking for an address or when your vehicle is having mechanical difficulty), use your hazard flashers. If passing is difficult and you're holding up traffic, pull over from time to time to let others get by. They'll thank you for it.

, The speed limit is technically an upper limit, and people are not required to drive any faster. If you need to go as fast or faster than the limit, pass when it is safe to do so.

, Not only does this prevent faster traffic from flowing past, the driver next to you will be continuously distracted by your vehicle in the corner of their eye. This problem is happening more and more because some drivers don't understand how to pass properly while driving on cruise control. If you are about to pass another vehicle while on cruise, and your speed is just barely faster, gently depress the accelerator to slightly increase your speed temporarily so the pass is completed in a reasonable amount of time. The shorter the time you are alongside a vehicle you are passing, the safer the pass.

, It is the passing lane and is not intended for general traffic flow, except in some urban settings. Some states, such as Ohio and Kansas, also have laws which require traffic to ""keep right except for passing"". If you're in the left lane and driving faster than the vehicles on your right, watch for vehicles driving faster than you coming from behind. Pull over so they too can pass, even if they are speeding (so you are not tailgated); or at least match their speed (within reason) until you can pull over.

,, Accept your short-lived punishment, indicate to the other driver that you are sorry for your infraction, and move on.

, Over the course of many miles, all lanes will go approximately the same speed. Excessive lane changing will not get you to your destination any faster, and ultimately only makes traffic run more slowly overall. It also increases your chances of a collision.

, Speeding up so they can't get into your lane is just childish, and it may mean you have made them miss their exit. Unless in fact they are switching toward the middle of the freeway. Then it may mean they intend to pass a vehicle in front of them, and may not have seen you. Use caution and allow them to merge if they continue to come into your lane.

, A signal to change lanes is not an invitation to pass. Some drivers are very particular about this ""rule"" and will get over anyway, regardless of whether or not they have room, and it is a good way to rear-end a driver, which would be your fault even if they slam on the brakes as soon as they are in front of you.

, Therefore you do not have to slow down on the freeway to get off - that's what the off-ramp is for. Conversely, the on-ramp gives you enough space to hopefully reach the typical speed limit (usually 55 to 70 miles (89 to 113 km) per hour) so that other drivers on the freeway do not need to slam on their brakes. (Notice that some on- and off-ramps may be poorly designed and thus slowing down or slamming the throttle might be necessary in these cases).

, Pay attention to signs indicating interchanges and on-ramps. If you have the opportunity, safely shift lanes to allow incoming traffic to merge in a clear lane. This will help prevent bottlenecks and backups caused by merging traffic being unable to enter the flow.

, If you have to pass a vehicle driving below the speed limit in the left (or passing) lane, you have two choices: pass them on the right (which is dangerous and sometimes illegal) or pull back and just drive at the slower speed. Do not tailgate them (see ""Don't tailgate"" step). Absolutely never pass on the shoulder of the road or blindly when there is the potential for oncoming traffic (i.e. on a state highway with 2-way traffic). This is not only illegal, but could result in you being personally responsible for the death of a pedestrian walking on the side of the road because their vehicle broke down.

, Ever. Even if you think you're not putting any pressure on the pedal, you may be depressing it enough to trigger the brake lights. In this case, other drivers won't know when you're truly braking. Other possible effects are brake drag, which results in premature brake wear and decreased fuel economy; or you could inadvertently push both brake and throttle in a panic stop, potentially increasing overall stopping distance significantly.

Obey the speed limit in school zones.,
Do not pass a school bus that has stopped and put out its stop sign.,
Pay special attention to your speed in areas where children often hang out, such as near schools and parks.,
Be vigilant during times when children are most likely to be outside.,
Keep an eye out for children darting around residential neighborhoods.,
Turn the corners of your neighborhood slowly since children often like to play on the street in front of their homes.

,
Back out of your driveway slowly.,
Drive carefully along streets that are lined with parked cars.,
Be careful when driving along streets with no sidewalks.,
Keep your eyes on the road when you drive around children.,Give younger children, who may walk more slowly, plenty of time to cross at pedestrian crossings.",How to Drive Safely Around Children," Though this limit may seem excessively low when you do not see any children, small kids can hide easily or make sudden movements. For this reason, speeding tickets in school zones can be particularly costly.;
, Children will be exiting the bus at that time, and may dart in front of your car unexpectedly. Be cautious driving near children even after the bus leaves since you do not know their next move.

, Be aware of ice cream vans, children often run towards these without paying attention to traffic. Be extra wary where children are playing ball games, they may run into the road after a ball.

, This is typically before and after school, and also during the day on weekends, holidays and summer vacation.

, Kids often play outside after school. They may be riding bikes or running, which can make it hard for you to slow down in time to see them if you are going over the speed limit.

,, Kids may be either walking or playing behind your vehicle. It can be hard to see small children from your rear view mirror, which is why quickly looking in it before backing up is not enough of a precaution. Glancing behind your car before you get in can give you peace of mind that there are no children there. Be careful driving out of any drive in forward gear too.

, Kids may be in between the vehicles, about to cross the street unexpectedly. If you do see feet under the cars, hinting that kids are present, drive slowly until you pass them safely.

, Children may find it hard to keep from entering the road in such a situation.

, Looking away to change the radio station is enough time for you to hit a child with your car.

Heed the warning signs.,
Drive at a safe speed.,
Drive defensively.,
Observe your surroundings.,
Be especially wary at sunset and sunrise.,
Drive carefully at night.,
Slow down when other cars are behaving differently.,
Be alert -- even when you're approaching a town or a city.,
Know when not to swerve.,
Honk your horn at the deer or moose in short bursts.",How to Avoid a Moose or Deer Collision1," Collisions occur most often in prime moose or deer habitat such as forested areas and waterways. If you see a deer or moose crossing sign, be extra alert and slow down. Moose and deer cross roads for a wide variety of reasons and at different times of the year. Often they want to get to another part of their habitat. Rutting season and hunting season also cause them to move. Stay alert.;
, Do not speed when you are driving through moose or deer country. You'll still arrive if you go more slowly and you'll have more time to avoid an animal if you spot it. Wildlife experts have recommended 90 kph/55 mph as a suitable speed for wildlife zones in good weather conditions, as it provides you with some reaction time to stop. Here are the things that suffer when you travel at too great a speed:


You can't stop quickly enough to avoid a collision.
The impact of a car/truck is far greater the faster you travel.
Your ability to take evasive action is massively reduced and you're more likely to resort to swerving instead of braking and gently responding.

, Be prepared to take evasive action, which includes being able to quickly slow down, brake suddenly or turn down blinding headlights. Drive so that you are able to stop within the space of your headlights; practice this in a safe area if you don't know how fast this is for your vehicle. Make sure your seat belt is on and check that all passengers are wearing theirs as well. A sudden lurch could have people catapulting from the car.

, Actively scan the sides of the roads as you drive for any signs of wildlife. If you have passengers, get them involved but ask them not to shout out as this is very startling and can cause the driver to react incorrectly. Ask them to calmly tell you that they see moose or deer lurking about. Look on the road sides, the shoulders, down into ditches (they love the grass there), median strips, intersecting roads, on the road itself and try to spot any signs of movement, flashes of eyes or body shapes.


Watch both sides of the road; there is some evidence that drivers tend to watch the side of the road next to the passenger seat more than their own side, making a false assumption that only one side is a problem. Scan both sides!

, Deer and moose seem to move most in the hours around sunset to midnight and again around dawn. These are also the hardest times for our eyes to adjust to the light because it's neither completely dark nor properly light, so we find it more difficult to see well. If you don't feel alert or can't see properly at these times, save your trip for another time.


Be on the lookout -- if you see one deer or moose, there are likely to be more deer or moose nearby, even if you don't see them. If you see one creature, it's more likely that you'll run into more.

, Use your high beams where possible and when there are no oncoming cars that you can startle with them; they will illuminate more of the area that you are travelling through. Here are some other precautions to take when you're driving in the dark:


Move into the centre lane if you are travelling in a 3 lane road, or centre the car as much as possible if it is a 2 lane road.
Make sure your windshield is clear and is not reflecting grime, preventing you from seeing clearly.
Drive below the speed limit, which has fuel economy benefits as well as safety benefits.
Scan the sides of the road for animals' reflective eyes, often visible at a great distance at night. Sometimes this is the only visible part of the animal until it is directly in your path.

, If you see flashing lights (hazard or headlights), hear tooting horns or see people waving madly about, slow down and be ready to stop! Of course, if a car stops suddenly ahead of you, you should also stop or at least slow right down. In these situations, the other cars may well have stopped because animals are already crossing the road ahead of you.

, You've just driven into the outskirts of town, so everything is safe now, right? Wrong! Moose and deer wander into towns and city outskirts in search of food. They could be munching away on the median strip or bolting from someone's front garden. Still drive carefully. When you do come across a deer or a moose, don't expect them to react rationally.


Blasting horns, flashing lights and a swerving metal machine are likely to terrify the animal witless and it will more than likely dart into your way rather than out of it. Bucks have been known to charge a stopped or moving cars of any size.

, If you suddenly have a deer before your car, brake firmly. Do not swerve and leave your lane; many accidents are not due to colliding with the deer but are the result of driving into another car or truck in the opposite lane while trying to avoid the animal. The best thing to do is drive defensively in the first place and go slowly enough that you won't collide with a moose and can brake in time.

, Only do this if the deer is far enough ahead and there are no cars around that can be disoriented by the honking. This may scare the deer away, but there's no guarantee that it will make the deer run off the road. If you're quite close to the deer, you may want to avoid honking at it, because the deer may get confused and come closer to you."
"
Diminish the impact if it is inevitable.,
Take care after a collision with a deer or moose.",How to Avoid a Moose or Deer Collision2," If an accident with a deer or moose is inevitable, here are some suggestions for lessening the impact:


Try to move to where the animal came from. This may take you away from it and the animal is more likely to keep moving forward rather than backtracking. This will only work if there is one animal. This will not work for deer.
Shift your line of eyesight to that spot as well - don't look at the animal or you'll steer that way.
Try to skim rather than fully impact the animal. Brake firmly, angle the car/truck and take your foot off the brake as you impact. The release of the brake will cause slight lift of the vehicle and this may be enough to stop the animal from rising into your windshield if your vehicle is tall enough.
If you're heading into a collision with a moose, lean toward the door pillar. In the Mythbusters where they tested this, the center of the car was completely crushed in every impact but the triangle by the door pillar was intact in each accident. No guarantees are offered; you are far better off avoiding the collision.

, There are some important steps to take after assessing if everyone is relatively unharmed:


Pull over if possible. Put your hazard lights on and if you can, put the headlights onto the animal or as close as possible.
Check passengers for injuries and treat accordingly. Even if there are no injuries, shock will probably occur fairly quickly. Try to reassure one another and if it is cold, put on warmer clothing immediately as shock or fear increases the inability to ward off cold. If it is winter, stay in the car for warmth.
Avoid going near the animal; it may kick or gore you from fear and pain. If it blocks the road, use your hazard lights and headlights and keep your car stationary. Only attempt to move the animal if you are 100% certain that it is dead.
Use road flares or triangles if you have them.
Call the police immediately or flag down help. Remember that most insurance companies won't pay for the damages you suffer from hitting a deer or a moose if you don't file a police report.

Clean off your car before driving.,
Drive slowly.,
Leave plenty of space for stopping.,
Keep a safe distance from the vehicles in front of you.,
Avoid speeding up hills.,
Learn to deal with skidding.,
Avoid using cruise control.",How to Drive a Car in Winter Weather1," When you walk outside to find a car covered in ice and snow, you should remove everything from the car before driving. This helps you see when you drive. Don’t just clean off a hole that you can see out of. This can significantly decrease your visibility.Clean off all windows and mirrors before leaving your home.
You should also clean the snow off lights so other drivers can see your headlights, blinkers, and brake lights.
Brush off your hood, trunk, doors, and roof. Snow can slide onto your windows and block your view, which won't be good when you're driving! It can also sling off and hit another car. Many states require by law that you remove all snow before getting on the road.;
, You may be stressed and running behind, but your safety comes first! No matter how long you have been driving, you should drive slowly in winter weather. Even if you have winterized your car, you may still lose control of your car. By driving slowly and paying attention, you not only keep control of your car, but can be aware of those around you who many not be as careful as you.Press the gas and brake pedals gently. Speed up and slow down slowly and take it easy as you turn. Make sure to start braking early to avoid sudden stops.

, Stopping on wintry roads is very different than dry roads. You should not try to stop the same way you do on normal roads. That may cause an accident! Leave at least eight to ten seconds to stop. Gently press the brake with the ball of your foot and avoid slamming on brakes.If possible, take your foot off the gas pedal to slow down at red lights and try to roll to it until it turns green so you don’t have to stop.

, You should double the distance you normally would between you and the vehicle in front of you. Keep scanning the vehicles in front of you and look out for brake lights. If you've kept your distance, you should be able to bring your vehicle to a stop with distance to spare instead of having to slam on your brakes and sliding into the vehicles in front of you., When you approach a hill, don’t press the gas pedal hard to try to get up the hill. This can cause you to spin. Instead, try to use inertia to get up the hill. Don’t stop on the hill because it can be difficult to get going again. If you have to press the gas pedal, do it gently and slowly., Skidding can be extremely scary! To correct for any skid, release the gas slightly and turn your wheels in the direction you want to go, very gently. Be careful not to over correct and do not press the gas until you are headed in the direction you want to go again.


If the car does not seem to turn, or turns too wide, easing off of the gas lightly might do. If that doesn't work, tap the brakes lightly and steer just slightly tighter into the corner. Simply panicking and steering sharply into the corner will only reduce control.
If the car is hydroplaning, gently ease off of the gas without lifting off of it completely. If necessary, ease off completely.

, Cruise control can be a relaxing way to drive. However, during winter weather, you shouldn’t use the cruise control on your car. This takes the acceleration and deceleration out of your control. On slippery surfaces that have snow, ice, or sand, this may cause you to slide or lose control of your car."

Have your car serviced.,
Check your battery.,
Check the antifreeze.,
Replace your wipers.,
Buy snow tires.,
Fill up your windshield washer fluid.",How to Drive a Car in Winter Weather2," You want to make sure your car is in the best shape possible during the winter. You don’t want to break down when it’s snowing or below zero. That can be stressful! Take your car to the mechanic for a checkup, or do your own maintenance on your car.Common things that break during the winter include hoses, belts, water pumps, and spark plug wires. You should also check the tire pressure.

, Dead batteries are not a good thing to wake up to on a cold morning. Another thing that you should check at the start of the winter is your battery. Old batteries may give out in the cold, or the charging system may not be working correctly. While you are checking the other parts of the car, you should check your battery.If you need to get a new battery, make sure it is powerful enough to start your car in the winter. During the winter, your car will have more difficulty starting than in the summer.

, Antifreeze is important to keep your car running during the winter. Most cars will do best with a mixture of water and antifreeze. For most winter weather, 60 percent antifreeze and 40 perfect water will be fine. In extreme winter conditions, use 70 percent antifreeze and 30 percent water. This helps keep the engine cool while having a low freezing point.Check your manual for specific antifreeze type recommendations.

, Having your wipers going out while on the road is no fun. If you live in an area with a lot of ice and snow, you should put winter wipers on your car. These wipers are heavy and are specially made to keep ice from collecting on the wipers.Before you turn off the car, make sure to turn off the wipers. Your blades can freeze on the windshield, which can mess up the motor of the wipers when you try to use them again.

, If you live in an area where it snows often every year, you put snow tires on your car. Snow tires can be difficult to put on your car, so permanently mount them on steel rims that a tire shop can easily put on your car in winter.You can store the tires during the winter, or many tire shops will store the tires and rims for you.

, Snow and icy conditions can make seeing out of your windshield difficult. If you drive behind a car, you may also get salt and road grime sprayed on your windshield. You need to put washer fluid in your car that is made for snow and below freezing temperatures.Winter formulas of washer fluid help remove snow and ice and doesn’t freeze.

Keep your gas tank filled.,
Place sand in the back of your rear-wheel-drive vehicle.,
Place a winter supplies in your car.,
Put an emergency kit in your car.",How to Drive a Car in Winter Weather3," One of the most important things you can do during the winter is keep enough gas in your car. If your car happens to break down, you will need to keep it running to stay warm. Doing this requires gas, so make sure you have a full tank for emergencies.When you idle your car to stay warm, the gas will last a long time.
Keeping your tank full also helps you not to run out of gas if you get too low.

, Rear-wheel-drive cars may slide more than other cars on snowy or slick roads. Placing a couple of bags of sand in your trunk can help stabilize your car.Place the bags in your trunk behind the rear axle. The bags should be around the middle of your trunk.
Avoid placing too much weight in the back of your car since that can lift up the front of your car. Try starting with around 20 pounds.

, You should stock a few helpful basic supplies in your car during the winter. Keep a snowbrush and ice scraper in your car to deal with windows. You should also place some extra washer fluid in case you run out while you are driving.You may also want to keep a shovel and bag of sand in the trunk to help in case you get stuck or can’t get traction.

, In case you break down, you have an emergency kit full of items to help you stay warm. Gather blankets, gloves, hats, food, water, and any medication you may need in your vehicle."

Refrain from driving when you’re tired.,
Check the weather reports.,
Keep your cell phone charged.,
Practice driving in winter weather.,
Stay home if possible.",How to Drive a Car in Winter Weather4," Driving when you’re tired slows your response times. Your focus and concentration is also compromised. During wintry conditions, this can be extremely dangerous. Try not to drive in snow or ice when you are tired or haven’t had proper rest., Before you go somewhere, especially a long distance away, you should check the weather. You should also do this if you are going to isolated areas. This helps you know what to expect. If the weather is very bad, you should postpone your trip.When you travel in winter conditions, let someone know where you are going and what time you should arrive.

, Make sure your cell phone has a full battery whenever you leave the house. You may also carry a cell phone charger in your car and keep your phone plugged up so you always have a full battery. If you break down or have any problems, you will be able to call for help., Practice makes perfect! If you're unfamiliar with driving in snowy and icy weather conditions, practice after a storm in a large, empty parking lot with a seasoned driver. Practice how to brake safely, how to get out of a skid, and how your car handles in winter weather. This can actually be a lot of fun!, Use winter weather as an excuse for a night in. Even if you can drive in winter weather, you are putting yourself at risk by going out. Other drivers pose a danger to you. Slick roads and black ice are also risks even to a experienced driver. Unless you have to go out, stay off the roads."

, Even if it is not a car stereo or deck, a simple MP3 player or an iPod with portable speakers can do the trick.

, Avoid salty snacks. Fruits are always preferable. They not only give you energy but are also tasty in-between-meal snacks.

, Even small things such as a rag cloth or a first aid kit can make a difference.

, You must not be in a hurried state of mind. That will only tire you quickly and make it even more difficult for you to sustain yourself throughout the long drive.

, On long drives, the last thing you would want would be to subject your ears to rock or metal music in short bursts. This will only increase the fatigue factor and induce boredom at critical moments. soulful rock or instrumentals are the best.

, have light meals but eat at regular intervals. You would not want to drive on an empty stomach. That would be disaster as driving is energy sapping. Lots of fluids throughout the journey is the best way to tackle the situation.

, Though this is contrary to the popular maxim, do not try out new and dangerous roads even if you have the vehicle to do it. Inclement weather coupled with rocky roads is a deadly combination.

, This will only stress you out. Take each mile as it comes. Some might take a while whereas some might get over before even you know it!

, Fresh air can wake you up and keep you alert.

Plan before you go.,
Hit grocery stores along your route.,
If you have a larger budget,stop at a local restaurant.,
Be careful about drinking water in a different area.,
If you are in a real hurry or very very broke, you can sleep in your car at rest stops or rural pull offs, or maybe splurge on a campground.,
If you have more time and a bigger budget, you can choose a motel.,
Don't forget camping!,
Call your home safety person at your scheduled check-in time.,
Plan ahead and watch your gas so you don't get caught off guard with the ""last chance for gas"" situations and end up stranded, out of fuel, in the middle of nowhere.

,
To prevent cramping, soreness, and thrombosis, stop the car approximately every 45 minutes (you can set a timer if you have trouble remembering) to 1 hour at most and have everyone get out and walk (nothing extreme, just a stroll to have a chance to stretch the legs, work the muscles and get the blood circulating) for approx 5-10 minutes.,
Enjoy your drive.",How to Drive Cross Country,";
, Pick up a loaf of bread, some sliced lunch meat and/or sliced cheese, or go really traditional with some simple PB&J. Be sure to throw in some easy to eat fruits and veggies like bananas, baggies of carrots, apples, etc.; maybe some nice healthier munchies like some dry cereal or nuts; less healthy crackers or chips; maybe even a small carton of milk or juice to help round out a cheap but pretty healthy road trip meal.

You can make sandwiches as you are hungry or if you are doing a drive as far as you can without stops trip. Just make up the entire loaf of bread into sandwiches and then store the prepared sandwiches in the bread sack. That way you are recycling the very functional bread sack and not having to carry around or dispose of a bunch of baggies (or have them sliding around in your car for thousands of miles). This method can get boring on a long trip but if you mix it up with occasional drive-thru dollar menus, it is not quite so boring but still pretty dirt cheap eating.

, It is more fun to try to pick local places, absorb the atmosphere of the place and maybe even sample local food favorites. If there is time maybe even visit with some of the other diners and learn a little about the area while you are enjoying your meal.

, It can cause everything from a little upset stomach to severe cramping and diarrhea that can last for several days (think Montezuma's revenge), which will ruin your driving experience. If it is severe or lasts too long please seek medical assistance.


Be careful when in restaurants. Unless the water is filtered ask for soda without ice (although in a lot of places the water for their ice is filtered—you can ask and see if you feel it's okay or not). Also if you are in a really questionable area, watch out for all uncooked foods, like salads that would be washed with the water but not heat treated to kill off the bad bugs.
All of this can be more or less of a problem based on your location in the USA and the city's, restaurant's or hotel's water quality/treatment. It's always better to be safe than sorry.
Some desert places, including some spots in Arizona, have little roadside pit-stop water machines, where you can just pull to the side of the road and refill your jugs with filtered drinking water. Never use one that says non-potable: this is never safe to drink.

,


Be very careful at rest stops. Some criminals view them as prime picking of easy targets.
Even if you are tight on time or funds, do everything you can to keep yourself and your travel mates safe. This includes being aware of your surroundings and watching out for any ""unsavory characters,"" traveling with a group of people including going to the bathroom in a group, flashlights for dark night bathroom trips or checking the bushes if you are suspicious, carrying something for self defense whether as simple as a whistle to draw attention and assistance or pepper spray or knowing some self-defense moves. If you have a weapon be sure it is legal to possess it in every location you are going to be, or else the law will see you as the criminal and put an unhappy twist to your cross-country trip.







, Do not base it only on price, but also on safety. Some of the cheapest places are not any safer than the rest stops, plus your vehicle can be vandalized or stolen while you are inside your room. There are some very decent places that don't cost a fortune, but try to overlook dated and old décor and fixtures. Look instead for nicer locations, nice safety features (like lots of lights in the parking area and pathways, security cameras, visible staff, etc.), clean, well-kept rooms, friendly and observant staff, etc. These will usually be what would be considered mid priced. For instance, decent chains with pretty consistent quality like Super 8 or Motel 6 are not the cheapest but certainly on the lower end.


It's great if you can find a hotel/motel chain you like, because then you will most likely be able to stay in one of their hotel/motels all along your trip.






If you are more adventurous try some of the novelty hotels and motels on your trip. They can really add to some interesting trip highlights, like the motel where the rooms look like Teepees.

, We have some very nice natural areas that would make really beautiful camping locations. It doesn't have to just be with a motor home or trailer. Tent camping can be a lot of fun too (don't forget safety though, with people or animals - snakes, lizards, spiders, mosquito, etc., just be aware and be as prepared as possible).

, That way if you end up lost or stranded it will be less than 24 hours since someone knew where you were, and they knew where you were planning on going.

,, You could walk around the car or take the opportunity to use it as a pit stop for bathroom or food or to take in a little of the view.


Yes, on a long trip these stops can make it take even longer to get where you are headed, but it makes the drive so much nicer and is a tiny bit of health insurance for everyone in the vehicle. It is amazing the difference it makes to everyone. You won't be as stiff and sore by the end of a long day of driving or riding, and the driver will find it helps to keep them from getting so tired and road weary (staying alert while driving is a good thing).
Frequent stops also allow for plenty of bathroom break opportunities, which is good for your bladder and kidneys too.






Especially with children, breaks are so important. Use them as an opportunity so see local sites, learn a little local history or visit a roadside stand, anything to get out for a minute or two. # A lot of people suggest setting goals of so many miles or so many hours in a day of driving If you are in a huge hurry that is okay, trying to make a challenge more manageable. However, if you have a bit more flexibility in your schedule, try not to get so tied up in that competitive ""I MUST make X miles before I can stop."" It can make the driver push themselves past exhausted, and can lead to sleepy drivers and more accidents. It also can make an exhausting day for the passengers too. Just watching the miles go by is boring, and being stuck in a car you are very limited on what you can do, and if you are traveling with children....this is a recipe for lots of whining and crying and complaining, etc.






If you must make a certain number of hours in a day while having children along, try to break it up. If you say you want to drive for 8 hours, try driving for a max of 4 hours, then take a ""mini-vacation"" and stop for a couple of hours, then get back in the car and go for another max of 4 hours.
Always listen to your body if you are driving. Some days you might only be able to handle 5 or 6 hours of driving, while on others you could plow on for 10-11 hours fairly easily, so don't stress about it too much or feel bad if you don't meet your ""daily quota"".







, There is a freedom in traveling the open road, and an excitement at the possibility of what may be coming around the next corner. All the senses can become engaged in the new sights and sounds and smells. The flowers in the spring, the stars in the middle of nowhere, the great sights (monuments and natural wonders), and so much more. Enjoy the ride; after all, life is a journey.

, Turn the valve all the way clockwise, or pull the lever back.

, Slide the knob on the round side of the box all the way to front.

, Quickly pull down on the cable (or push the lever) twice in quick succession to make the steam whistle sound out two short blasts.

, The top one must be moved from right to left to release the brakes on the engine.

, Grip it firmly and give it a yank towards you. As you feel the engine move slightly, shove it back in most of the way, so that it does not gather speed too fast. Gradually open throttle as the locomotive approaches track speed. Observe cylinder cock exhaust and close them when only steam is emitted. Move the Johnson bar slowly back toward vertical, but never too close to vertical. This is like the gear shift of your car and admits less steam per cylinder stroke. In turn, this increases the efficiency of steam usage so you don't over work the poor guy throwing coal into the fire (and to conserve fuel and water!) If the locomotive's wheels slip, close throttle most of the way immediately. Allowing the wheels to slip will not render any tractive effort and will damage the locomotive's driving (powered) wheels if done continuously (also ""tears"" holes in a coal fired locomotive, or in an oil burning locomotive, can cause hollow booms much like an explosion). Wheelslip, as it's called, may cause excess damage if allowed for too long. This includes damage to the firebox itself, which may or may not result in the locomotive exploding. Blow the whistle and ring bell at all crossings of all types and DO NOT EXCEED TRACK SPEED. That is very dangerous, as derailments due to excess speed may occur, even on straight track. This too can cause boiler explosions. See the Wreck of the Old 97 for example.

Get better snow tires.,
Keep your tires inflated.,
Pack an emergency kit.",How to Drive a Prius in Ice or Snow1," Although the Prius navigates better in the snow and ice than some people think, upgrading to stronger snow tires is a good idea.


Make sure to have snow or ice tires on all four wheels too. If you only have them on the front of the car, the Prius might drive better, but it will still have issues with stopping in the snow and ice and with maintaining control in those conditions.
The Prius comes with low rolling resistance tires. That means they won’t have great traction, especially in snow, which is why it’s important to buy winter tires.Replace your winter tires in the summer. The dry pavement will cause them to wear more quickly because their rubber has softer composition than summer tires.;
, That will make them work at maximum efficiency. Not only is that good for your pocketbook and the environment, but it’s also better for controlling the car in the snow and ice.


Cold air will cause your tires to deflate by making air molecules contract If your tires are not properly inflated, and this will make it harder for the car to move by increasing rolling resistance.
Snow tires might cost you some fuel efficiency, but they will make the car more stable, and that’s important when driving in snow or ice. Inflating the tires can help you regain some of that fuel efficiency.
Adequate snow traction requires tires with at least 6/32 inch deep tread.Inflate your tires (this applies in all seasons) to the maximum on the side of the tire -- ignore what it says in the manual or on the driver's-door post.

, It’s important that you’re prepared for anything when it’s icy and snowy outside, especially in a smaller car like a Prius.


You should keep a snow and ice scraper, a flashlight, and flares in your car. Make sure that you’re dressed properly for the conditions, including bringing a hat, boots, and gloves.You should make sure your rear window defogger and defroster work too. You also might want to include a small shovel in the car. Top off your car’s levels. It’s really important in winter conditions to keep your car’s fluids full.
Buy premium heavy duty snow and ice windshield wipers. It’s worth the extra money to make sure that you don’t have windshield wipers so flimsy they can’t move heavy snow off your windshield.

Expect less fuel efficiency.,
Embrace the winter.,
Keep your gas tank at least half full.",How to Drive a Prius in Ice or Snow2," It’s just a fact that most vehicles tend to have reduced efficiency in the winter months. The Prius is no different.


The problem is that the climate control system in the car must run constantly in order to heat and defrost the inside of the car. This keeps your engine in constant motionThat in turn reduces fuel economy for the Prius in winter, usually to the 34 to 42 miles per gallon range for the Gen. II Prius and 38 to 46 miles per gallon for the Gen III model. Sometimes Prius drivers notice the reduced winter efficiency more than other drivers because they’re more focused on the multi-display screen on their dashboard that provides such data.Some people say gas mileage falls to between 33 and 40 miles per gallon down from 50 average in the summer. Battery capacity also goes down in cold weather.

, Some people worry that a Prius can’t handle ice and snow at all, so they avoid buying one if they live in colder climates. However, that’s not true.


The Prius is a front-wheel drive car. This means that the car’s heaviest portion is on the drive wheels, which will give the Prius better grip on snow and ice than a back-wheel drive car.
Furthermore, electric motors provide an advantage in the snow because of how they distribute torque. The car has a traction control system that will brake a spinning wheel.
Some people think the Prius won’t be good in snow because it has 5.25 inches of clearance above the ground. However, that’s usually enough clearance for roads, especially plowed roads. Non plowed roads in severe snowstorms will be a challenge for all cars, not just hybrids.

, Simple tips like not letting your tank go almost empty can make it easier to drive a Prius in the winter.


If you have more gas in your car, it should get better traction. That is because the gas will add weight to the car, which makes it drive better in snow and ice.
The other problem with almost empty gas tanks is that they are susceptible to condensation. This can then form in the tank, and it freezes the fuel lines. That in turn could stop your car from starting.
Never run your vehicle in an enclosed area like a garage."
"
Turn on the brake mode.,
Clear snow off the car.,
Drive better.,
Don’t use cruise control on an icy surface.",How to Drive a Prius in Ice or Snow3," If you put the car in drive first, you will change the driving dynamics. This will make the Prius navigate better in packed snow.


There is no way to turn off the anti-skid feature in a Prius while driving. Instead, turn on the brake mode. To do this: Turn off traction control temporarily. In 60 seconds, set the ignition switch to on.
Put the transmission in park, and then press the gas pedal twice before applying the parking brake. Now push down on the brake pedal. Put the transmission into neutral by surpassing drive.
Press the gas pedal two times. Press the gas pedal two times with the transmission back in park. You will see a car warning flash on the LCD screen. Now press the brake pedal again. Turn the ignition switch to start. Start the engine. The warning symbol on the LCD screen will likely disappear.

, Make sure that you remove snow from the lights, the license plates, and the radiator, where it may accumulate.


It takes more energy for the car to move extra weight. One thing that it’s worth carrying though is a small bag of sand or cat litter, so that you can get out if you get stuck in the snow.
If you clean out the interior of the Prius, you will also improve its efficiency. The lighter the better.
The only extra weight you should carry is the emergency kit., Give yourself more space. Driving a Prius in snow and ice isn’t only about the car itself. It’s also about the driver.


In the winter, give yourself more space between the car in front of you. Basically you should double the space you would leave in the summer.
For every 10 miles per hour (16 kph) you drive, you should give yourself four car lengths of space. So if you are driving 30 miles per hour, leave 12 car lengths between your Prius and the car ahead of you.
Be very observant so you can navigate slippery curves and spot stop signs and stoplights. If your brakes start to lock up, don’t slam on your brakes. Instead ease your foot off the accelerator and allow the car to slow down by itself. Don’t drive too fast for conditions! Don’t drive at your normal speed.

, Use your seat belt at all times. If you become stuck, stay with your vehicle so people can find you and you have shelter. Don’t walk in a severe storm.


Use small, slow motions and go easy on the brakes. Apply steady and gentle pressure on the gas. Slow down. Drive defensively. Make sure the battery is good. Warm up your engine to improve efficiency. All of these tips can help the Prius navigate ice and snow more safely.
Make sure that you have enough anti-freeze and windshield wiper fluid. You have to come prepared when it’s winter.

Pump your brakes (if you do not have ABS brakes).,
Accelerate gently.,
Learn how to steer out of a skid.",How to Drive in Icy Conditions1," Your first instinct may be to slam on the brakes, which is correct, but can result in loss of control. Only pump the brakes if the car starts to veer to the left or right, or if you need to steer the car around something. High speed only increases the danger of losing control so it is best to avoid excessive speed.


Give yourself plenty of time to brake in icy weather. Start breaking long before you actually need to stop, just in case you experience ice.
If you don't quite understand how or why you need to pump the brakes, try practicing the technique in a safe but icy spot, like a completely empty parking lot with plenty of room. Drive on the ice a little, then abruptly brake. See how the car skids? Now try it again, this time pumping. The difference in control should be clear.;
, There is much less friction between the road and tire in slippery conditions. If you accelerate too quickly, your wheels tend to spin. Accelerate slowly and gently, testing to see whether your tires have good traction. If you do not feel them gripping, slow down and start the process again.


If you find yourself in a situation in which your tires can't get a grip, sprinkle the area in front of them with sand, gravel, kitty litter, old towels, or other friction tools. You may also need to dig out some of the snow around them to give them room to move.
Accelerating slowly is another technique that can be practiced in an icy, empty parking lot. Try starting the car on a patch of ice and going hard on the gas. The tires will probably start to spin. Now try again, this time slowly pushing the gas to let the tires get a trip.

, First take your foot off of the accelerator so your car will slow down and regain traction. Gently steer your car in the direction you want it to go. If you overcompensate for the skid and begin sliding the other way, steer back in the direction you want to go. It may take a few subtle movements to straighten your vehicle out.When you're moving in the right direction, you can gently pump your breaks or accelerate to regain control.


Remain calm if you skid. Resist the urge to overcompensate by swinging your wheel too hard in the other direction. Gentle, calm steering will correct your car's direction and set you back on track.
Practice losing and regaining control of your car in safe lot. Approach an icy patch and accelerate into it so that your car begins to skid. Gently steer your way out of the skid by guiding your car in the direction you want it to go. This can be a lot of fun!

Get a basic maintenance check up.,
Get new tires if your treads are wearing out.,
Check your tire pressure throughout the winter.,
Consider investing in snow chains.,
Be prepared in case your car breaks down.",How to Drive in Icy Conditions2," Toward the end of fall, take your car to the shop to get a routine check up and make sure everything is in working order. The last thing you need in icy conditions is for your car to break down while snow piles up on the windshield. When you take your car to get winterized, have the mechanic check the following, and replace anything that isn't working properly:


Tires and tire pressure
Battery
Belts and hoses
Radiator
Brakes
Exhaust system
Heater
Oil
Lights
Ignition system
Wipers
If your area is ice all the time,install spiked tyres. They will puncture the ice,which will boost your friction greatly.

, Even if your mechanic thinks you have some life left in your tires, if you're heading into an icy winter, you might want to think about getting new ones. The biggest hazard in winter driving is sliding on ice due to poor traction. It's a safety risk no matter what the state of your tires is, but if your tread depth is getting low you're at greater risk of wiping out.


The tire-industry standard for good snow and ice traction is a 6/32-inch tread. Make sure the tires you pick out will do an adequate job in the conditions you'll be facing. Tires designed for high performance in summer don't do well on icy roads.If your facing a long, harsh winter, you might want to invest in winter tires. They're designed with a deeper tread that works well in icy and snowy conditions.

, In cold weather, tire pressure naturally drops. Tires that aren't fully inflated can have a slower reaction time when you're trying to steer, which could be dangerous when there's ice on the road. Check your tire pressure every few weeks to make sure they're fully inflated.To check your tire pressure, use a gauge to determine the tire's pounds per square inch (PSI) of pressure. See whether it's lower than the recommended pressure for your tires.
If you need to adjust the pressure, find a source of air (gas stations have them, as do body shops) and fill the tires one by one, checking the pressure frequently to make sure you don't overfill them., Snow chains and other devices designed to give the tires more traction on ice are good to have in the trunk in case a blizzard blows in. The chains aren't difficult to fasten around the tires, and you take them off as soon as the roads are dry again. Talk with your mechanic about which type of device is best for your vehicle.


If you live in a region with steep hills and lots of ice, or in a place where salt trucks don't routinely come by to treat the streets, get top-of-the line snow chains that are easy to take on and off when visibility is low.
If you're traveling through notoriously icy terrain, you might see signs specifying that snow chains are mandatory. If you're on a trip and you didn't buy snow chains beforehand, you can pick them up at most stores that sell auto parts.

, The most important thing about driving in harsh icy and winter conditions is to always be prepared. In the winter months, this means you should have jumper cables and an emergency driving kit stored in your vehicle's trunk. Just in case you get stranded for several hours, it's a good idea to have a supply of food, water and blankets as well.


Always bring along a cell phone when you go out in icy driving conditions. Fender benders and more serious accidents are extremely common when there's ice around, and you want to be able to call for help right away.
You might want to look into getting a AAA membership or having a local tower's number handy as well.

"
Scrape your windows before you leave.,
Drive in areas that are frequented by salt trucks and snow plows.,
Drive at half the speed limit or lower when there's ice on the road.,
Leave plenty of space between your car and the next one.,
Watch out for black ice and other hazards.,
Pull over when necessary.",How to Drive in Icy Conditions3," Do not leave your driveway with frost or snow on the windows. You'll need to have the best possible visibility while you drive over ice and snow. Give your car time to warm up a little so the windows are completely defrosted and snow-free.


You should also check the wipers to make sure they aren't frozen. If you have to drive through blinding snow it's imperative that they function properly.
Make sure your side mirrors are clean of snow and ice as well.

, If you know you have to go out in a snowstorm, steer clear of places that get so little traffic or are so hard to reach they don't get treated with salt and plowed. Find a route to your destination that doesn't get clogged with traffic, but that's central enough to get properly treated.


The salt causes the ice to melt, allowing your tires to gain better traction as you drive, but in very cold temperatures, it won't melt. In these cases the roads might get treated with sand, which sits on top of the ice and helps your tires grip the road better.
Highways are usually treated and plowed right away, but you want to avoid areas with a lot of traffic. Ice and snow tend to bring out the worst in other drivers. Even if you know what you're doing, you don't want to be surrounded by panicked drivers.
Stay alert for the presence of salt trucks and plows, since they tend to drive more slowly than other vehicles on the road.

, Going too fast in the snow and ice is the easiest way to run off the road or cause an accident. Start out slow to test how much traction your tires are getting. Find a comfortable speed you can drive without sliding or losing control.


Visibility is often low when snow is driving into the windshield, so you might have to slow down whether you want to or not. If you have trouble seeing other cars, drop your speed even more.
Though you should err on the slow side, you don't want to go so slow that you impede the flow of traffic. Try to go the same speed as the cars around you so another driver doesn't bump you from behind.

, Do not get so close to the next car that you'd easily hit it if the driver were to slam on his or her brakes. Leave enough space so that the other car or yours has room to slide or weave without risking a collision.

, Black ice is nearly impossible to see until you're on top of it. It tends to occur in shaded areas and toward the sides of the road. People tend to drive over it at high speeds since they don't realize it's there, so black ice is responsible for a lot of bad accidents. Be extremely alert as you drive, and if there's any chance at all that black ice might be on the road, make sure you're driving slowly.


Overpasses and bridges freeze before the rest of the road, so approach these areas with caution as well. As soon as snow starts to fall, you should drop your speed and be on high alert.
The other big hazard in icy conditions is other cars on the road. As mentioned, snowstorms tend to make drivers feel panicked. Check your mirrors often and stay as alert as possible so you have time to react if you see a car careening toward you. Stay as far away from other drivers as possible.

, If you encounter an area where accidents are constantly happening, you are sliding often, it may be simply unsafe to continue. Better to be late than wreck your car or be injured.

Pull over and wait out the storm or until the roads are more passable. Ideally, this would be a relatively comfortable place to wait, such as a restaurant, rest stop, mall, or the like. #*On an interstate or major highway, you may have to pull over to a shoulder. Put on your emergency blinkers so you are more visible. However, if you are in a situation with heavy traffic this may be dangerous if traffic passing are sliding off the road.






In an emergency situation, take measures to keep yourself safe and prevent hypothermia. Keep your heater running and use the blanket and other supplies from your emergency kit to stay as comfortable as possible. Use your cell phone to call emergency services for assistance. Even if you have to wait a few hours, they will know where to find you.
If you get stranded in very cold weather, and you are trapped you in the car, studies have shown that the best thing you can do is stay put. If you try to leave the car you risk getting overexposed to the cold.Rescuers will likely be looking for cars in the area where you got stranded.

Accelerate, decelerate, and turn much slower than normal.,
Use your headlights.,
Accelerate steadily when going up hills and don't stop.,
Increase your following distance from other vehicles.,
Stay alert and aware of your surroundings.",How to Drive in Snowy Conditions1," When you're driving in snowy conditions, you should take your time because your vehicle may take longer to react than usual. Slowly applying the gas and gradually accelerating is the best way to gain traction when you lose traction in your rear tires.While you're driving, decelerating abruptly or making sharp turns at a high rate of speed may cause you to lose control of your vehicle.


Try to maintain a speed of 45 mph (72 kilometers) or less.Anticipate times where you'll have to stop and decelerate slowly, far in advance of where you have to stop.Test your car's accelerating, braking, and turning abilities on a clear stretch of road before driving to your destination.;
, Test your lights before starting your trip in the snow. Make sure that they are visible from the outside and remove any of the built up snow that may be obscuring them. Use your lights during the daytime when it's snowing because visibility is worse for all drivers on the road.


Test your headlights and brake lights once a month to ensure that they are operational., Don't try to power quickly up a hill by slamming the gas pedal because it may cause a spinout. Try to gain momentum and use it to get up the hill. Don't stop while going up a hill because your car could get stuck in the snow.When you are coming up on a crest of a hill remember to decelerate steadily in advance. You don't want to go fast on a downward slope because you could lose control of your vehicle., Following closely behind someone could cause an accident if you have to brake abruptly. Under snowy conditions, it's recommended you stay 100 feet (30 meters) behind the car in front of you.Pay close attention to the brake lights on the vehicle in front of you in case you have to come to a sudden stop.

, While you should always be alert while you're driving, it's even more important to do so when driving in snowy conditions. Practice defensive driving and pay attention to other drivers on the road.


Other drivers may not have the same level of skill when it comes to driving in snow, so they may lose control of their vehicle and cause a collision with your car or truck.
Keep your radio turned down so you can hear if other cars are losing control or are honking their horns."

Take your foot off the gas and the brake.,
Accelerate slowly when fishtailing.,
Pump your brakes in a front wheel skid.,
Turn the wheel into the skid.,
Slow down after skidding.",How to Drive in Snowy Conditions2," When you first get into a skid, take your foot off of both of your vehicle's pedals.Your first instinct may be to hit the brakes, but this may not always help you recover from a skid.


Slamming on the breaks could make your skid even worse.

, Once you've taken your foot off both pedals, determine whether the back wheels have lost traction. If you are fishtailing, or the back of your car is sliding uncontrollably, this is called a loss of rear wheel traction. Gently accelerate to regain control of your car.The goal is to regain traction on your rear wheels before you can start to decelerate.


This is also commonly referred to as oversteering., If you are veering off into a direction and can't stop, it's most likely because you've lost front wheel traction on the road.In this case, you should pump your brakes to regain control of your car, after you take your foot off of the gas pedal.


If you have anti-lock brakes, then you should apply steady pressure instead of tapping the brake. Check your owners manual for information on your car or truck., Turn the wheel into the direction of the skid if you lose rear wheel traction. If it's skidding left, then turn your wheel left. If your rear wheels are skidding to the right, then turn right.Aim to stay on the road, but don't try to force the wheel or overcompensate.

, Once you've regained control of your car after a skid, reduce your speed. The reason you went into a skid is either because your wheels have been worn down and no longer have traction on the road, or you were going too fast. To avoid an accident, and potentially hurting someone, slow down and stay alert.

Get the right tires for the snow.,
Clear your windows, lights, and mirrors of snow.,
Test your windshield wipers and defrosters.,
Make sure your car is equipped for an emergency.,
Determine if driving is worth it.",How to Drive in Snowy Conditions3," Equip your car's tires with chains or get snow tires and make sure to inflate them completely.The tread on your tires should be at least a 6/32-inch deep tread. Summer tires don't typically have the tread that's required to keep your vehicle from skidding during snowy conditions, whereas snow tires come with a special rubber compound that grips to the road in the snow.If you are getting snow tires, make sure to that all four of your wheels are the same model.
Snow chains should only be used in emergency situations and when there is a full layer of snow or ice on the ground. Chains could damage your tires or the body of your vehicle.Read Install-Snow-Chains-on-Tires to learn how to attach chains to your tires.

, To be fully aware of your surroundings while you drive, you need to have access to all the mirrors and windows in your car. Blind spots could cause an accident when merging or switching lanes. Lastly, ensure that you remove all snow from both your brake lights and headlights so that other cars can see you.


Make sure the car's exhaust pipe is clear of snow because it could create a buildup of carbon monoxide which could be fatal., Snow on the windshield while you drive could reduce your visibility. Windshield wiper fluid will allow you to remove any ice that may be stuck on your windshield or frost that accumulates while you drive. Defrosters will also help you remove any initial snow and ice on your windows.There are windshield wiper blades that are designed for the snow and icy conditions. , Make sure that your car is ready to handle a trip in the snow and that you have the right equipment to deal with it. Bring things like blankets, a cell phone, scrapers, and shovels in case your car gets stuck in the snow. The more prepared you are, the less likely you'll have to wait for a tow truck or a plow to get you out of a bad situation.


Other things to bring include flares, jumper cables, sand to melt the snow, dry food, a first aid kit, and emergency tire sealant., The best way to avoid getting into an accident when it's snowy out is not to go out at all.Determine if driving is necessary. If there is an official winter warning in your area, then try to stay home. Limit your driving in the snow to emergency situations.


Call your employer and tell them that you can't drive in the conditions because it's a threat to your safety, instead of trying to drive into work.
If you commute and get stuck in the snow at work, see if you can stay at a local hotel or motel instead of driving back home.

Solution 1 (no cars around you): You should already know if there are cars near you (read ""Stay alert"").,
Solution 2 (cars are around you): This situation is much more tricky.,
If the object were a bit further away, the best decision would probably be to use your brakes for a short period of time, release them most of the way (all the way, and the transfer of weight off your front tires may cause your vehicle to become unstable when you try to swerve, or just under-steer), then swerve.",How to Do an S Swerve in a Car," Do not touch your brakes! With only one second to react, braking will only reduce the amount of traction available to your front tires, and may knock your vehicle out of balance, and thus, out of control, during the quick maneuver.


Jerking the wheel toward the desired direction is not the safest way to swerve either (for all the same reasons as braking is unsafe). A controlled swerve is always best. If you out-steer your suspension, your car will only under-steer, possibly causing you to hit the box. You should steer swiftly without being jerky. Once out of the path of the box, roll the wheel the other way to straighten your vehicle out. Again, if you do it too fast you will spin out! Using your brakes before you straighten can also cause you to spin out. Once you are out of the way of the box, you have more time to correct your car's direction, so do not be hasty, and do not overcorrect.
In this situation, no braking is involved, and the first turn away from the box should be done faster than the correction back in to the correct direction.;
, If you are unable to move to the lane next to you, you should determine if there is a shoulder you can use. If there is no clean exit, the least dangerous exit is likely hitting the box. Use the correct braking techniques and slow down as quickly as possible. A 70 mph (110 km/h) car is not likely to be able to stop in 100-feet, but any reduction in speed will reduce the damage done to you, your passengers, and your car.


In a non-critical situation: If the box ends up being empty, and no damage is taken, be aware of cars behind you which may rear-end you because you are going slow, or are stopped in the middle of a freeway. Find a safe way to remove the box from the freeway, and continue. If the box does damage your car, be sure you and your passengers are alright. If you are able to safely get the car to the side of the road, do so. Keep it off the road, and stay in the car, the freeway is a dangerous place to be. Call (hopefully you have a cell phone) the police, and report the accident.
In a critical situation: if your car still functions properly after hitting the box (if you are trying to get somewhere) continue your journey. If your car does not function properly, hopefully you are not being chased and your life is not threatened by this problem.

, The lower your speed is during the swerve, the safer the swerve will be executed.

Identify that you’re in an understeer situation.,
Control your natural response to understeer.,
Unwind the steering wheel.,
Ease off the throttle.,
Apply brakes if need be.",How to Correct Understeer During Cornering1," The first and most important step to correcting understeer while cornering is mental. You need to recognize what the vehicle is doing as understeer in order to take corrective action to address it.Identifying that you are in an understeer situation is the only way you can know to correct it.
Pay close attention to the response you get from your vehicle to identify understeer.;
, When you turn the steering wheel and find the vehicle not responding by turning as much as it should, the natural response is to turn the wheel even more. Once that fails to work, the next natural reaction is to hit the brakes as you realize you have limited control of the direction the vehicle is traveling. These are both dangerous responses to understeer that can result in an accident.Turning more and hitting your brakes could lock the tires and remove any control you currently have over the vehicle.
If the brakes do slow the vehicle quickly, the weight of the vehicle will shift onto the front wheels that are turned too far, resulting in the vehicle suddenly and wildly changing directions.

, Once you’ve realized that you are in an understeer situation, calmly return the steering wheel to straight. If you are in a corner, turn into the direction you are skidding slightly. This will align the wheels with the direction the vehicle is moving, allowing the tires to start turning again to create grip.Point the wheels in the same direction the vehicle is moving to allow the tires to start spinning again.
Make sure to maintain total control of the wheel as you allow it to center itself.

, While slamming on the brakes could result in locking up your tires, easing off the accelerator pedal will slow the vehicle in a more subtle manner. As the vehicle slows, the weight will transfer toward the front of the vehicle, adding to the traction your front tires are able to get.Be sure to straighten the wheel out before easing off the throttle to avoid the vehicle turning suddenly as grip returns to the tires.
Easing off the throttle will only work if the tires are pointed in the direction the vehicle is moving.

, If easing off the throttle did not change the speed of the vehicle sufficiently to return traction to your front wheels, put your foot on the brake and apply them gradually to avoid locking the tires up again and losing steering control.Be careful not to press on the brake pedal too hard or abruptly.
If you lock up the front tires under braking, take your foot back off the brake pedal to allow the wheels to begin turning again.

Prepare yourself mentally for understeer situations.,
Look for signs that the car is pushing as you turn.,
Feel for reduced resistance in the steering wheel.,
Pay attention to the pressure you apply to the brakes.",How to Correct Understeer During Cornering2," It is common for drivers to panic or even freeze up when their vehicle fails to behave as anticipated. While this is natural, it is also extremely dangerous. Combat this by preparing yourself to identify understeer situations by looking for signs of it.The best way to avoid panic is to develop an understanding of what causes dangerous situations.
You cannot correct understeer without identifying it.

, As you drive, pay attention to the way the car reacts to your steering input. If you turn the wheel to the left or right, but feel the momentum of the car carrying it forward rather than in the direction you’re trying to turn, you are in an understeer situation.In extreme understeer situations, the vehicle will not turn but will continue to go straight regardless of steering input.
In less extreme situations, your ability to turn may just be limited.

, When understeer occurs, the vehicle is pushing forward despite your steering input. This means the front tires are sliding and don’t have the grip to change the car’s direction as you turn the wheel. That loss of grip will make the steering wheel feel suddenly lighter and easier to turn.When the steering wheel suddenly gets much easier to turn, be careful not to turn the wheel even further due to the loss of resistance.
Some luxury cars may be more difficult to read steering resistance in due to their light wheel resistance to begin with.

, Understeer commonly occurs due to a loss of traction in the front wheels, and because most vehicles do the majority of their braking with their front wheels, heavy braking can cause understeer. If you lock the tires up by slamming on the brakes, the front tires will not have the traction to affect change in the direction the vehicle travels.If you slam on your brakes and they lock up, the vehicle will understeer due to a lack of traction.
Vehicle’s equipped with anti-lock brakes can still understeer due to heavy braking.

Brake prior to cornering.,
Travel at the appropriate speed for road conditions.,
Use the rule of thumb “slow in, fast out” when cornering.,
Avoid adding too much throttle as you turn.",How to Correct Understeer During Cornering3," Your tires are only able to do one hundred percent of one thing, so if you attempt to brake and turn simultaneously, you could lose traction in your front tires resulting in understeer. You can avoid this issue by braking prior to the turn so you are less likely to lose grip.You are more likely to lock up your tires if you are turning and braking at the same time.

, Understeer is more likely to occur when there are other elements limiting the amount of grip available to your tires. Situations like heavy rain, snowfall or ice can all limit the traction of your tires and increase the likelihood of understeer.When traction is limited due to road conditions, drive slower and carry less speed into turns.
Follow posted speed limits and pay attention for signs indicating a change in road surface.

, An easy way to avoid understeer situations is to follow the old racing rule, “slow in, fast out.” That means to approach corners slowly, then accelerate out of them. This method will prevent you from being taken by surprise by steeper turns than you expect.When driving in unfamiliar areas, approach corners slowly, then accelerate once you know you can handle them.
Roll onto the accelerator slowly as you accelerate out to avoid causing understeer inside the corner.

, If you come into a corner slowly and realize you’d like to go faster, you may be tempted to accelerate quickly through the remainder of the corner. Remember that your tires traction will be compromised if you ask them to accelerate and corner simultaneously.Add throttle gradually as you turn to maintain traction in the tires.
Front wheel drive cars are more prone to understeer as your accelerate because you may get front wheel spin if you give it too much gas.

Know the situations in which it would be useful to double clutch downshift.,
Find an empty parking lot.,
Start off in a low gear for practice.,
As you depress the clutch, shift into neutral and release your foot from the clutch.,
Depress the accelerator — with the car still in neutral — to increase the RPMs.,
With your foot off the acceleration, push in the clutch one last time.,
Shift down from neutral into your desired gear.

,
Release the clutch, quicker than you normally would.",How to Double Clutch Downshift," In the days before syncromesh transmissions, double clutching was a necessity if you didn't want to tear up your gearbox. Nowadays, you can downshift all you like without double clutching, although the shift isn't going to be all that smooth and the RPM will rev up. Still, here are two reasons why you'd want to double clutch downshift on your manual transmission car:


For smoothness of shift, especially when skipping more than one gear. If you're taking a turn around a bend and don't want to ride your brakes, you can downshift from 4th to 2nd gear, for example. Ordinarily, skipping a gear without double clutching in your downshift will cause the shift to be somewhat jerky.
Prolonging the life and health of the synchros. If you drag the gear from 3rd to 2nd, for example, it takes a little while for the 2nd gear synchro to do its job, meaning that the gears don't mesh all that well. Double clutch downshifting, if done properly, will switch gears instantaneously, preserving the life of your synchros.;
, It's best to practice in a space that's not heavily frequented. While double clutching isn't horribly difficult, you want to minimize your chances of something going wrong while you learn the ropes.

, Accelerate up to 3rd gear, for example, and push in the clutch in anticipation of a normal gear shift. So far, you aren't doing anything you haven't done before.

, You should be traveling roughly 25 mph (40 kmph) with your transmission in neutral.

, Your goal here is to hit the accelerator until the engine RPMs are just a bit higher than the RPMs that you will be at in the lower gear, helping the transmission speed balance out the engine speed.


To understand the concept, imagine what happens when you merely drag the transmission from 3rd to 2nd, for example, without doubling clutching. Your RPMs shoot through the roof, don't they? Well, the goal is to get the RPMs closer to what they would be in an ordinary downshift before the downshift happens. This relieves pressure and minimizes wear on the transmission.

, This is where ""double clutching"" gets its name: It's the second time you've hit the clutch before shifting into a lower gear.

,, There you go — you got it. Start off practicing the double clutch maneuver in low gears and low speed. Once you get the hang of it, gradually increase both the speed at which you're traveling and the speed with which you double clutch downshift.


While the basic technique is pretty straightforward, mastering it will take some time. If you're serious about racing, you may even want to invest time in heel-and-toe downshifting, which takes considerable practice but utilizes the same basic concept.

Keep your eyes on the road.,
Never text or talk while driving.,
Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.,
Stay wide awake when driving.,
Keep the radio turned down.,
Download a safe driving app.",How to Be a Smart Teen Driver1," Don’t put on make-up, play with the radio, or talk with friends in your rearview mirror while on the road. Keep asking yourself, “Am I watching the road?” If the answer is “no,” then refocus or pull over and take a break., Turn your phone off or place it on silent before you even get into the car. Bluetooth or other “hands-free” devices are one option to consider, but even they increase the risk of getting into an accident. It’s not worth the risk, so just make calls before and after you drive.Many states have passed bans against texting or talking on cell phones while driving. If you break this law you could risk losing your permit or license., Just don’t do it. If you’ve been drinking alcohol, then your reflexes are likely impaired, making it very dangerous to get behind the wheel. Go ahead and call a friend to pick you up or a ride service, such as Uber or Lyft.Also, don’t make the mistake of accepting a ride from anyone else who has been drinking.
Some medications can make you drowsy or unfocused, too. Talk with your doctor about non-drowsy drug options.

, Getting on the road when you are drowsy or fatigued can be hazardous to you and everyone else. Pull over to a safe spot or call a friend or family member for assistance if: you start yawning constantly, your eyes keep closing, you can’t keep your eyes on the road, or if you hit the rumble strips.If you are on a short drive, sometimes simply stopping, stepping out of the car, and getting a soda or coffee can keep you awake enough to get home safely.

, This may sound a bit odd, but listening to loud music can actually be a huge distraction on the road. You may miss important warning noises, such as honking horns or even emergency sirens. Dial the volume down until it is simply background noise when you are driving. Or, better yet, keep the radio off while you are learning., Some apps, like TextArrest, will disable your phone automatically when you enter your car. The basic mode of this app, as with many others, is free. You pay a fee to upgrade and unlock more features. Other apps, such as DriveScribe, track your driving habits and offer rewards based on safe behaviors."

Make everyone wears their seat belts.,
Go the speed limit.,
Use your turn signals.,
Pass with caution.,
Practice defensive driving.",How to Be a Smart Teen Driver2," When you first get into your car, make a habit of putting on your seatbelt. Also, don’t let any of your passengers ride with you unless they wear their seat belts. Since it is your vehicle, make it your responsibility to protect everyone inside of it.Don’t allow more people in your car than the number of open seat belts.

, Look for the posted signs and stick to the limit. Keep an eye on your speedometer closely to make sure that you stay on target. Going over the speed limit cuts down your reaction time and is a huge risk factor for accidents., Flip on your signal with plenty of time in advance before turning or changing lanes. This gives other drivers enough time to react before you make any moves. When you are finished turning or changing lanes, then turn it back off., Passing can be one of the most critical skills that new drivers must master. Take your time when deciding to pass and make sure that you’ve fully cleared the other car before moving back into the lane. Keep to the speed limit when passing, but try to speed up a bit so that you don’t hang out in their blind spot.Don’t make a move to pass: if there isn’t enough space; if the line is solid yellow; if there is a blind spot, like a hill, ahead; if there is a tunnel ahead; or if there is road construction being completed.

, Just because you are committed to following the law doesn’t mean that others drivers will. Don’t assume that other people on the road are good drivers. Instead, watch other drivers carefully and take your time before making a move. If you see an aggressive driver, try to get far away from them as quickly as you can.For example, don’t assume that another driver will actually make a turn based on them using their turn signal. Wait until they’ve actually completed their turn before making your move.

Drive with a license or legal permit only.,
Practice driving with other adults.,
Attend a teen driving skills program.,
Ease into nighttime driving.,
Limit bad weather driving.,
Sign a teen driver contract.",How to Be a Smart Teen Driver3," Know the restrictions that apply to your license and permit. Most permits require that you are accompanied by a legal driver over 21 years of age. Most licensees face a probationary period when they cannot drive with minors in their car. Make sure to follow these rules closely, or you could end up facing a delayed or removed license.Driving laws vary by state, so check your local Department of Motor Vehicles website for details.
Carry your paper permit, paper temporary license, and final license with you when driving. This way you can show them to a police officer upon request.

, Aim for at least 30 to 50 hours of supervised driving time after you have your license in hand. This lets you continue to learn and safely make mistakes while being watched over by a more experienced driver. Ask your parents to help out or reach out to a family friend. Vary your practice sessions by driving in all conditions and at different times of the day., After you’ve received your license or permit, you can still take classes to improve your skills on the road. Contact your local police department to ask if they are currently offering any courses. Some non-profits and companies, like UPS, hold classes for teens, too.These classes are often offered free of charge and you get to practice with the newest technology, like driving simulators., Many cities or counties require that new teen drivers follow a curfew for the first few months up to a year. To find out the exact restrictions, check with your police department. Even without a formal curfew, it is a good idea to limit your night driving to emergencies only until you have a few years of experience.When you do drive at night or even at dawn/dusk, use your headlights. This makes it easier for other drivers to see you., Heavy rain, snow, sleet, or fog can test the best driver. Check the forecast before you leave on a drive and if the weather looks bad, delay your trip until it clears. If you have to go, then triple the space between you and the car in front. Remember that you can always pull over to a safe spot if you need to.Don’t activate cruise control if the roads are slick. It will delay your reaction time and give you less control over the vehicle., Sit down with your parents and write up a driving agreement. This document can apply to all drivers in the household, not just you. It should address issues such as cell phone use, practicing good driving skills, and how to react in dangerous situations. Have everyone sign the contract and agree to celebrate every six months that it is followed.If you are a responsible driver, but your parents are worried about your safety, signing a contract is one way that you can offer them some reassurance.

Select a safe car.,
Perform regular maintenance on your car.,
Make sure that you have enough gas.",How to Be a Smart Teen Driver4," Get a car that has many safety and navigation tools. Anti-lock brakes and stability control features will make you a smarter and safer teen driver. They buy you extra time in the event of a potential accident. Even a well working defroster can improve your visibility.You can find the safety rating of most vehicles by entering the year, make, and model information into an auto website, such as Edmunds.

, Keep your tire pressure at the proper levels. Get an oil change as often as your owner’s manual recommends, usually 3,000 miles. Check that all of your fluids, like power steering, are filled up. Wipe off your mirrors and windows to improve visibility. Taking good care of your car can make it easier to be a safe driver.It sometimes helps to keep a journal on your phone or a paper notebook in your glove compartment listing dates and information for all maintenance performed.
Enrolling in a roadside assistance program, like AAA, is a great way to protect yourself in case you have a breakdown.

, Before you set off on a trip, check your gas gauge. Try to keep your tank at least a quarter full at all times. This gives you enough gas to make it through bad traffic safely. Your car will also run better when it’s not running on fumes."

As a general rule, if you notice the day becoming darker (even just slightly), it's a smart idea to flip your headlights on. Though you may not need your headlights to see the road during these times, other drivers may have an easier time seeing you with your headlights on (especially if the setting sun is behind you, obscuring the view of oncoming traffic).Additionally, it's important to note that in many jurisdictions, driving without your headlights on in the evening or morning can be against the law. For instance, in California, headlights must be on from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise (and during any other low-visibility conditions).;
, As a general rule, night driving requires slower speeds than daytime driving. Because visibility is much lower at nighttime than during the day (even on well-lit urban roads), it takes longer to see and react to traffic hazards, pedestrians, and other obstacles. Since you can't control the types of hazards you'll encounter on your drive but you can control your driving, your smartest move is simply to drive slower, giving yourself more time to react to any problems you come across. You'll never want to ""out-drive"" your headlights — that is, to drive so fast that you can't stop within the distance illuminated by your headlights in front of you.


A good rule of thumb for night driving is: ""The posted speed limit is the highest speed that's legal — not the highest speed that's safe."" Don't be afraid to go slower than the posted speed limit if you can't see very far in front of you, especially if you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop, where your visibility is further obscured. Allow other drivers to pass you as needed.

, Statistically, there are almost always more drunk and overtired drivers on the road at night than there are during the day.This can have deadly consequences — for instance, in 2011, drunk driving contributed to more than four times as many accidents at night as it did during the day.Both of these conditions can dramatically lower a driver's reaction speed and lead to reckless behavior, so keep an eye out for erratic drivers on the road and give them a wide berth.


Keep in mind that weekend nights (Friday and Saturday) usually have more drunk drivers than ordinary weeknights because many people choose to start their weekend with a drink or two. Holidays can be especially bad. For instance, some analysis has shown that the early hours of January 1st can be the deadliest time of the year for drunk driving accidents., Just as you'll want to keep an eye out for other motorists who may be impaired by fatigue, you'll also want to make sure to keep your own fatigue in check. Being fatigued on the road can have many of the same risks as being drunk, including decreased awareness, slower reaction times, frequent ""spacing out,"" weaving in and out of the lane, and so on.To fight these problems, be sure to stop frequently, giving yourself a chance to exercise, have some food and/or caffeine, and re-focus before getting back on the road.


If you're too tired to drive safely — for instance, if you're having trouble keeping your eyes open — pull over or find a rest stop and get some sleep. It's much better to be safe than sorry and the life-threatening risks of falling asleep at the wheel for just a few seconds are much more important than the inconvenience of being late to your destination.

, Animals crossing the road can be especially dangerous at night. It can be very difficult to see animals ahead of you on poorly-lit roads when driving at high speeds and crashes involving large animals like deer can be deadly or cause major damage (for the driver, animal, and car). Stay vigilant when you're in places where deer or other animals are likely to cross the road (like rural areas). Pay attention to any animal crossing signs posted near the road and lower your speed appropriately. Additionally, be aware that most deer-related accidents occur in the late fall and early winter (though they can happen year-round).If you see an animal ahead of you, the smartest move is usually not to swerve. While it may be your first instinct, swerving is actually the leading cause of injuries and fatalities from deer-related accidents.Instead, lower your speed as much as you can by pressing the brakes and allow your car to hit the animal.
One useful trick for spotting animals ahead of you is to look for their retinas. While it's usually difficult or impossible to see an animal's body before it comes into the range of your headlights, you can often see the light reflected in its eyes from much farther away.If you see two closely-spaced glowing dots in the darkness up ahead, slow down!

, ""Spacing out"" can be a big problem for nighttime drivers. To stay focused, try to keep your eyes moving while you drive. Constantly scan the road ahead of you for potential hazards. Glance to the sides of the road and check your mirrors occasionally to remain aware of your surroundings. Resist the urge to simply focus on the dividing line in the middle of the road — this doesn't give you much important visual information and can ""hypnotize"" you into a state of reduced awareness.The relatively quiet, calm atmosphere of most night driving and the uniformity of dark or pitch-black surroundings can combine to put night drivers into a dangerous trance-like state. Even if a driver doesn't outright fall asleep, this distracted state, which can cause lower reaction times, forgetfulness, and other dangerous problems, can be very unsafe. Always stay alert and vigilant — your life and the lives of other motorists may depend on it.

, It may seem obvious, but it definitely bears mentioning that all of the safety precautions you take during the day are especially important at night. Make sure to buckle up, adjust your seat and mirrors, put away your cell phone, and focus on driving while you're behind the wheel. These simple, everyday precautions make driving safer and accidents less likely, day or night.

, Your headlights are your most important lifeline when driving at night. If they're not in good working condition, you're essentially increasing your risk of an accident for nothing. Keep your headlights clean by washing them every few weeks — this should keep their brightness and clarity high. If a headlight burns out, replace it as soon as you can during the day and avoid driving at night until you can do so. Note that it is often illegal to drive without proper working headlights.


In addition, for top visibility, you'll want to keep your windshield, windows, and mirror as clear and clean as you can. Avoid using your hand to wipe these important parts of your car — the natural oils of your skin can leave obscuring smudges. Instead, use a newspaper or microfiber towel.

, Your car's high-beam lights can seriously boost your safety while driving at night, but only if you use them correctly. High-beams should be used when driving in very dark, low-visibility areas where there is not much traffic. In these cases, high-beams can make your field of vision much wider and deeper, so use them as needed.


Be sure to turn off your high-beams when following another car or there is oncoming traffic. In these cases, the bright light of the high-beams can distract other drivers, making it harder for them to drive safely.
If you're rounding a corner or going over a hilltop and you start to see the faint glow of another car's headlights from around the bend, turn your high-beams off in advance so that the other driver isn't suddenly blinded.

, Sometimes, a car's headlights are angled lower to the ground than is necessary or aren't aligned perfectly symmetrically. The brightest headlights in the world aren't useful if they're not properly angled to illuminate as much of the road in front of you as possible, so if you're having a hard time seeing ahead while driving at night, you may want to consider having your headlights re-adjusted. At a professional mechanic's shop, this procedure is usually quite quick and cheap.


It's also possible to adjust your headlights yourself. Since every car is different, if you want to do this, be sure to follow the instructions in your car's owner's manual. Be patient — it can take some time to get a set of headlights aligned perfectly., In a perfect world, other drivers would always dim their high-beams when they see you, just as you would for them. Unfortunately, drivers don't always remember to do this. If an oncoming car has its high-beams on, avoid looking at them, as their bright light can momentarily blind you. Instead, glance to the right hand side of your lane (or, in countries that drive on the left side of the road, the left) while keeping your peripheral vision alert to hazards. This keeps you as alert of the hazards around you as possible while preserving your vision.


If a car behind you is using its high-beams, try adjusting your rear view mirror to keep the light out of your eyes. You can even move the mirror to shine the light back at the driver and alert him to his mistake., If you anticipate doing lots of driving at night and in foggy conditions, you may want to consider investing in a set of after-market fog lights. Often, these lights are mounted low on the front bumper to illuminate as much of the road ahead as possible (fog often is thinnest in the foot or so just above the road).However, not all after-market lights are created equal, so talk to an automotive expert before making this purchase.


Never use your car's default high-beams in the fog. The reflective water particles that make up fog can shine the bright light back at you, obscuring your vision of the road more than if you had used no lights at all.

, Other cars' headlights (and especially high-beams) can pose unique challenges to drivers with glasses. Glasses can sometimes reflect oncoming lights in ways that create an obscuring glare for the wearer. To avoid this, try wearing contacts or buying a set of glasses that use an anti-reflective coating, which should minimize these effects.If you do buy a specialty pair of glasses, keep them in your car so that they'll be available to you whenever you go driving.

, Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations.


Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely.

, Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no ""right"" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more):


Kavinsky - ""Nightcall""
Chromatics - ""Back From the Grave""
DJ Shadow - ""Midnight in a Perfect World""
Kyuss - ""Gardenia""
Allan Kingdom - ""Evergreens""
Golden Earring - ""Radar love""
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - ""Hold Tight""
Quiet Riot - ""Party All Night""
Daft Punk - ""Contact""
Charles Mingus - ""Moanin'""

, Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly ""come to life"" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night ""flavor"". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for:


Late-night diners/hang-outs
Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night)
Truck stops/rest areas
Scenic paths and overlooks
Camp grounds
Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.)

, Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!

If you’re building a jetpack, unscrew a competing jetpack. Look at the materials used and how you can save time and improve upon your design.Similarly, for electronic products such as websites or applications, dig into the coding. Find out the ways you can improve the product to make yours more successful.
Don’t copy someone else’s design, or else you’ll get sued. Incorporate what you learn to refine your own design.;
, Write or type out your product’s ideas on a piece of paper. Draw what your product will look like, if you can. This will give you a rough idea of how the first prototype will look and allow you catch flaws and ways to improve the design before you invest in building a prototype.

Use the sketch to decide upon what features are necessary to your design. Choose the few features that allow your design to function and limit the amount of costly extras, such as painting and adding voice commands to your robot vacuum design.

, CAD requires specialized training, so a professional can help you with this. The computer design is much more detailed than your initial sketch. This is the design you will give to the prototype maker in order to get the most clear and detailed idea of your product. If your product isn’t something you’ll be able to make at home on your own, you’ll need this.

Be sure to check the credentials of your designer as well as their cost per hour. Ask for examples of their work and possibly credentials from a certified CAD school program.

, The first example of your prototype may be made at home and can be made in miniature to save money. Physical products can be made with whatever you have laying around your house, such as making your leather handbag design out of some nylon clothing you’re not using. Having a sample design of your product makes it easier to explain to prototype designers and investors and will give you another chance to refine your design.At this point, the design doesn’t need to be perfect. This handmade design only needs to be presentable, showing that your idea is possible.
Using alternate material from your original design forces you to test your idea and consider why you made it the way you did. You may even find that the nylon works better than the leather for your handbag.
For physical products, choose a cheap modeling product such as Shapelock, which when treated with heat can be molded like clay.For electronic products, search for third-party programming libraries in order to save time on coding and image design. Fill in these parts later.

, While making a physical design by hand is an option, thanks to technology, you can use computer software to make a digital prototype. Various types of software take your idea, either drawn out on paper or inside the software itself, and turn it into a 3D, interactive design at less time and cost than making it yourself or hiring help.Programs such as Prototyping on Paper and InVision let you upload designs and make interactive models to mimic how customers will handle your product.
Try programs such as Dribbble and Freebiesbug to buy user interfaces for mobile applications in order to save time or money spent on a designer.
Use a program such as Skala Preview to monitor changes you make to your design as you work.

, Prototype-making involves molding, assembly, and labor costs. Traditionally, making a prototype gets somewhat expensive. Settle upon the material you want to use for your prototype, which should be the same as what you want to use in the final product. Speak to representatives at companies and check their costs and credentials.

You may also be able to someone who can make your prototype cheaper, such as a student from a local university.

, As you consult with prototype companies, ask about their credentials and past work to ensure that the prototype will be quality and true to your design. Even if the company you choose has worked well with its customers in the past, get a non-disclosure agreement from the company or designer before you hire them, unless you already have a patent.

The more professional the prototype looks, the easier it will be to sell to prospective buyers.
The non-disclosure agreement serves as legal protection in case someone steals your design.

, 3D printing is a rapidly expanding field. These printers use CAD designs from scanned or computer-made 3D models to layer material into a working prototype. Many firms exist now that offer a simple, cheaper alternative in prototype-making. Be sure to check a company’s costs and credentials before you hire them.These printers are also increasingly found in homes, so you may be able to print the prototype yourself.
Remember to get a non-disclosure agreement if you don’t have a patent so no one can steal your design.

, A good prototype gives your product more appeal to investors. First, you can approach friends and family for extra funding, but you may need to approach outside sources to make your product’s production a reality. There are several ways to do this, such as pitching your product to companies, finding investors through networking, or trying crowdfunding.

Crowdfunding can be done online through sites such as Kickstarter where you showcase your design for pre-purchases.
You can trade equity in your product to sites such as 500 Startups and Y Combinator for an investment.Contact brand names that would be interested in your product or seek out individual investors and convince them of the success of your idea., Make as many of your product as you can sell. The initial construction cost of a prototype is expensive for anyone who doesn’t have a lot of extra money on hand, so you don’t want to get stuck with a large inventory. As you try to sell your product, you’ll also need to go back and improve upon the design.Consider packaging and shipping costs in addition to manufacturing and storage.

Tune up the engine to enhance its performance.,
Check tire inflation.,
Increase horsepower by upgrading the car engine if the need to increase speed and your financial situation warrant it.

,
Install a lower ratio differential (rear end).,
Remove all excess weight from the car.,
Turn off the air conditioning.,
Drive the car at peak torque and horsepower.,
Accelerate your vehicle on approaches to steep hills, especially short ones.",How to Make Your Car Run Faster on Uphills," Depending on the mileage and service history, this may include changing the air filter, spark plugs and plug wires, and in cars built before the early 1980s, adjusting the carburetor, engine spark timing, and valves to peak out the engine performance.;
, This may not help much, but properly inflated tires, leaning slightly toward maximum inflation pressure, have lower rolling resistance which transfers more engine power to propelling your car, as well as giving better gas mileage.

,, A rear differential with a 411 gear ratio will give more torque to the pulling wheels than a 243 gear ratio. Consider the effect on gas mileage, though, since the 411 gear ratio will increase the engine revolutions per tire revolution, and in other driving situations this means the engine will need to turn many more RPMs to maintain normal driving speeds.

, Look in the trunk, behind the seats, and anywhere you may find heavy cargo stashed away. One of the methods the new car manufacturers are increasing auto fuel efficiency is by using the lightest weight material they can find in building new cars. A drastic measure for increasing your speed might mean buying the smallest cranking battery available, reducing the amount of gasoline in the tank to the minimum to make your trip, leaving the spare tire and tire changing tools at home, and even possibly removing some of the non essential accessories from the car.

, This one accessory drains a significant amount of engine power to operate the compressor.

, This means downshifting when the gear you are driving in begins to lose power, or ""pull"". You need to keep the engine RPMs close to the maximum to get the maximum speed from the car. This is easier to do if your car is equipped with a tachometer, but listening to the engine gives you a fairly good idea how it is doing. Automatic transmissions will down shift by themselves, but high RPM driving can overheat the transmission fluid, so do not maintain high torque conditions for long periods.

, Truck drivers pulling heavy trailers will get maximum speed up when they see a steep hill ahead to prevent the need to downshift on the inclined grade.

Reel in the fish as close as possible.,
Wait until the fish gets tired and calms down.,
Hold the back grip of the gaff with your dominant hand.,
Lower the gaff and position it behind the gills.,
Pull and lift the fish into the boat.",How to Gaff a Fish1," To get in range to gaff the fish, you'll need to make sure that it's right against your boat. Reel in the fish so that it's as close to the side of the boat before attempting to gaff it. Gaffing a fish on the side of the boat is optimal because you'll have maximum mobility and can use the side of the boat to help stabilize the fish once you gaff it.Reaching for a large fish that's too far away from the boat could destabilize you and cause you to fall into the water.;
, When the fish is still fighting on your line, don't try to gaff it because it can easily become unhooked and you can lose it. Instead, hold the fish on your line and wait for it to tire itself out. Once it's calm, you can begin to align your gaff.Take a look at the fish while it tires itself out and make sure that it's the species you want and is big enough to take home.

, Hold the back most grip of the gaff with your dominant hand so that you can get the longest reach possible with the pole. Stick the gaff up and over the side of the boat while holding onto it tightly., Move the gaff across the backside of the fish and position the hook facing down. You should aim for the spot that's right behind the fish's gills, right under the dorsal fin. This soft area is easy to penetrate and can hold the weight the fish.Other areas, like near the tail or stomach, are softer and could cause the gaff to become dislodged, or you could rip the fish apart.

, With one quick motion, you'll want to penetrate the flesh of the fish by pulling on the gaff pole. Once you've hooked the fish, lift up to sink the hook into the fish. Use your other hand and grab the front grip of the gaff pole to help stabilize the pole and drag the fish in.Try to do this in one fluid motion.If the fish is still thrashing around, you can hold it on the side of the boat until it calms down before transferring it to the boat's floor.

If you have a choice of vehicles, choose a vehicle that does not ride high off the ground and is comfort- but not performance-oriented.,
Keep the car ready with a few simple things the passengers might want.,
Avoid sudden movements.,
Avoid uneven movement.,
Find a smooth road surface.,
Avoid going faster than the flow of traffic overall.,
On a long trip, take a break at least every two or three hours or so, before one becomes strongly needed.",How to Drive Passengers in Comfort,"


A car marketed on performance will generally have a somewhat harsh ride due to a stiff suspension for more ""road feel"" and best cornering on smooth roads.This may mean more fun for you, but more distraction and discomfort for your passengers, especially if any of them are prone to car sickness.
A vehicle that rides high, such as a truck or SUV, will sway and due to a high floor often not have as much legroom as a minivan or midsize or large car.
Bumpy-treaded tires give an unpleasant, buzzing ride. Thin tires on big wheels may be stylish, but they lose the cushioning of a big bubble of air all around to gently compress and absorb the little bumps you roll over. Roll like NASCAR and Formula One on tires with the usual proportions.Longer is better. A longer wheelbase, which tends to go with a longer car, decreases pitching from bumps and increases directional stability at speed. Some long cars have enough rear-seat legroom for the front passenger seat to recline almost flat in front of the bench for sleeping rather than leaning up onto it. Some luxury cars, minivans, and even the new hybrid car ""Prius V"" have rear seats that recline, too, but check for adequate legroom in the front and back simultaneously. A long vehicle can be hard to park at first, but surprisingly easy to pull into or parallel park in tight-looking spaces once you learn how.
Most mid-size or full-size sedans, minivans (Including low-riding ""SUVs"") or vans with nice seats are good choices. For a given amount of money a nicer model of car, with bigger, stronger parts and more sealing, will generally feel more polished overall than a cheaper one with a lot of ""options"" only noticed occasionally. And watch out for very fancy cars--long-term reliability and maintenance may have been sacrificed for a target market that doesn't care.

In the United States, a Crown Vic (Including the extra-long ""Commercial"" type), Grand Marquis, Town Car (Including the extra-long ""L"" type) is a choice of many professionals due to its great size, nice though not best possible comfort, and extreme durability and ease of maintenance. Minivans are popular too.Look for a gas engine, with at least six cylinders. It's noticeably smoother than four. But a small four-cylinder or diesel engine will save quite a bit of fuel, and the four-cylinder may be cheaper up front, too. See how you like each kind in a quiet car at idle, accelerating, and cruising before you decide.


Hybrid cars are often optimized for fuel efficiency over comfort and even cost-efficiency, but can save a lot of gas by regenerative braking and provide plenty of comfort at low speed in stop-and-go commuting.


For almost all drivers, an automatic transmission will shift more smoothly. If you prefer a manual, practice driving it smoothly by gently matching engine and transmission speed as you shift.
Mild window tint can keep the car cooler and make sunlight and nighttime lights less distracting. Sunglasses are a good alternative or supplement. Try inexpensive wraparound polarized ""fishing glasses"", which can fit loosely over prescription glasses.
Good headlights let you see further and so drive more smoothly and safely at night. Separate high and low beams are generally more effective than a single bulb with two filaments. HIDs are even better, and their cooler color may promote wakefulness, but they are more expensive to buy and maintain.

Check the ""shock absorbers"" on a car that's been well-used. Their job is to gradually absorb or ""damp"" the energy of the car's blows against bumps in the road which the springs turn into gentle bounces so that the car gently lifts or dips but does not continue to sway. They eventually wear out, and replacing them can affordably renew the ride.
Leather seats are easier to keep clean and so more compatible with eating in the car (Avoid perforated ones), but cloth seats resist sun damage, grip to provide better support, and are considered more luxurious in Japan.Either can can be fitted with covers, including tough cloth-backed vinyl from a taxi supply shop.
Ride quality isn't everything. Convertibles can be noisy, creaky, and tiring, but the view into a towering city and the breeze on a nice day beat any car roof. Rent one for a special occasion.;
, For instance, bottles of water (No big deal if they spill it), non-messy heat-resistant snacks such as Clif bars in case they get hungry,tissues, a plastic bag or bin for trash (Keep it emptied regularly; bring many bags if you fear a carsick passenger), an umbrella, bug repellent or sunscreen depending on the destination, and some free trunk space. On a long drive add blankets, neck pillows, and sunglasses so the passengers and/or spare driver can doze off without the driver being overly warm. Stocking up on some medicine for headaches, stomach aches, and car sickness and any other illnesses your passengers might have isn't a bad idea either!


You can keep warm drinks in a vacuum flask with a spill-proof lid through which to drink, or even have someone warm food in a low-power car microwave called a ""WaveBox"". But it would be best to stop for a picnic with anything that could be messy.

, The passengers, unlike the driver, will not instinctively stiffen themselves to resist and not much notice sudden movements. Fast acceleration and hard braking also exacerbates car sickness. When starting out, ease onto the gas, and when slowing, ease onto the brake. Slow down gradually before turns. Proceed slowly through winding or hilly areas (But not too slowly if other drivers are present): tossing from side to side and ""floating"" past crests can be unsettling. At the same time, don't be afraid to make sudden movements to avoid danger.

Familiarize yourself with the car's handling in all kinds of conditions. This will help you drive it more confidently and smoothly. For instance, try a long twisty road when you don't have any passengers.






Adjust your seat and mirrors; make sure the headlights are working well. If you can see something early, you will not need to swerve to avoid it. Consider adding blind-spot mirrors.






If you have a button to turn off ""overdrive"" (Lock out the highest gear), you can tap it for gentle steady engine braking such as from highways and on hills. Be sure to turn it off when it's time to speed up again.

, Try to maintain a comfortable momentum without stop-starts and weaving.



Freeways or motorways are best. Even if a little slower than usual (but still somewhat fast because there aren't any stops). However, don't use if jammed.
Find a lane in which you can maintain a steady speed without being a nuisance (Not the left one, and sometimes not the right one) and maintain plenty of distance from the car ahead to avoid fiddling with your speed.
Use the cruise control, including for small adjustments to speed, except in very heavy traffic.
So long as you can turn it easily and freely (This is best with power steering), hold the steering wheel around the 8- and 4-o-clock positions, especially when headed in a more or less straight line. The weight of both arms resting on the top of the wheel tends to make it automatically swing a little to the side in which it is unintentionally deflected, until a force is consciously applied. But deflecting the wheel with both arms' weight resting toward the bottom tends to make it automatically recenter. So long as your movement is not obstructed, rest your arms in comfortable places and arrange them and your grip so the wheel stays centered (And certainly doesn't tend to drift you toward oncoming traffic) except when consciously shifted.

, The rightmost lanes in right-hand traffic countries are sometimes more pitted from trucks.

, This increases noise and the need for sudden movements significantly. Also, passengers create distractions that make high speeds particularly unsafe, and there are more people at risk from any accident.

, This enables passengers to refresh regularly without having to feel that they're inconveniencing you by asking you to stop somewhere and it gives everyone the chance to stretch. You might even consider changing drivers at such a break.

Only gaff fish you know you want to keep.,
Don't gaff barracuda or sharks.,
Gaff fish larger than 50 pounds (22.67 kg).",How to Gaff a Fish2," Don't bother gaffing a fish if you're unsure if you're going to keep it. Gaffing a fish on its side will harm it, and if you throw it back it will most likely die in the water. For this reason, only gaff fish that you know you are going to keep and take home., Unless you're fishing specifically for sharks or barracudas you should avoid gaffing them all together. Many fishermen don't bring these fish on board because of the risk of getting bitten. Instead of gaffing these fish, cut your line and let them have the hook., Gaffing is especially effective for reeling in larger fish. If you are trying to catch fish that are smaller than 50 pounds (22.67 kg) you can use a net to bring them into your boat. Netting smaller fish rather than gaffing will ensure that you're not damaging the fish if you decide to throw it back."
"
Don't gaff the fish near the tail.,
Have at least two people fishing when gaffing.,
Use a flying gaff for fish that are over 200 pounds (90.71 kg).,
Keep gaffing hooks covered when you're not using them.",How to Gaff a Fish3," Gaffing a fish near the tail opens up the opportunity for it to thrash around and potentially hurt someone. Be careful not to gaff the fish near the tail, especially with fish that have sharp spines or teeth., When gaffing fish, it's important that you have one person leading the fish on the pole and another person gaffing. Don't attempt to do both things yourself because you need both of your hands to gaff., When targeting larger fish like makos, swordfish, or large tuna, a flying gaff is much safer than the traditional gaff. The head of a flying gaff separates from the pole and is cleated to the boat by a 15-foot line. This puts the strain off of you and distributes it to the thick line., Keep all gaff poles in storage when you're not using them.Additionally, you can cover the sharp tips of the gaff hooks with safety spring, tennis ball, cork, or PVC tubing."

Explore your senses with blindfold taste testing.,
Romance each other with old fashioned love letter writing.,
Arrange a romantic scavenger hunt for your lover.,
Get a little raunchy.",How to Find Romantic Arts and Crafts to Do Together," Romance is all about the senses so engage and heighten your sense of taste and smell during this romantic activity.


Name that wine (or beer). Have your partner select a few of your favorite wines (or champagnes or beers) and line up glasses for you to sample. The idea is that you have to describe the smells and flavors exuding from each glass and then guess what type of wine you are drinking. If you want to stay within one family (for example Pinots), take it one step further and try to name the winemaker. Test each other over candlelight to add ambiance.
Try different types of romantic food. Choose a line of exclusive, silky chocolates or sample foods that are known to be an aphrodisiac (like oysters or honey). Use a blindfold and feed each other. Then have the blindfolded sampler describe and then name that food. Try to pair similar foods so you don’t end up with a stomach ache (very un-romantic). For example, try a line of sweet foods together or something salty.
Identify that scent. Certain scents are known to trigger romance so perform a similar activity as you did with food but use scents instead. Use scented candles or oils as your medium and choose from vanilla, rose, musk, caramel or strawberry amongst others.;
, In the days of Shakespeare or Elizabeth Barrett Browning, travel back to the days when a well written, hand scribed letter made lovers swoon.


Send each other romantic poems that you have either written or taken from a famous poet. Exchange letters containing one of your favorite romantic poems or try your hand at writing an original love poem to your sweetheart.
Set up a secret mailbox for letter delivery. In the book, “Little Women” the girls exchange secret letters with boy pal Laurie through a hidden mailbox. The secretive mailbox and special location will add a clandestine, intimate element to your activity. In addition to leaving letters, consider adding romantic treats with your letter such as a single rose or a piece of decadent chocolate.
Write letters using Shakespearean language for added romance. Travel back in time and try your hand at writing in Shakespearean prose to your betrothed. Show your lover how you pine for him/her and describe your love using references from Shakespeare plays as examples.

, Kick your night up a notch with a little romantic scavenger hunt. Leave clues for your honey that will ultimately culminate in an evening together.


Provide clues before your sweetheart arrives home or at your house. Clues could even begin while your betrothed is at work (for example, an email could tell him/her to walk to the car and find the first clue). Provide hint and riddles to lead him/her to you. Include fun, inside jokes or stories as clues (such as referencing your favorite movie as a couple or the place where you had your first date).
Set the tone for romance throughout the house. This means that the kids should spend the night at the neighbor’s house (or your mom’s) as you prepare for an intimate evening. Turn on soft music and dim the lights for an ultra romantic effect. Light tea candles to line the walkway as he/she arrives and sprinkle rose petals throughout the house.
Leave a special treat when he/she finds each clue. Sweeten the scavenger hunt with a piece of candy, a bottle of wine or a rose along with each clue. You could even make your treat part of the clue or hint for the next destination.
Keep the activity short but sweet. Don’t take him/her on a lengthy, wild goose chase, but instead keep it short and sweet. Leave between five to 10 clues.

, Get a little sexy and intimate with your activity. From body painting to naughty movie drinking games, add a little spice to your romance.


Have a rude food dinner. Definitely adults only, so send the kids either to bed or to a sleepover. Create phallic-shaped bread or design a banana split he/she won’t soon forget. Examine food shapes to create hilarious, rude shaped food. Some possible tools include bananas, grapes, melons, squash and zucchini.
Chocolate body painting. Somewhat traditional, but always fun, try your hand at chocolate body painting. Numerous adult novelty stores offer specialty chocolate body painting or you can make your own mixture at home. Choose your favorite type of chocolate (dark, milk, etc.) and combine with 17.5 ounces of chopped chocolate with 13.5 ounces of cream. Heat using the double boiling method and stir special enhancements if you desire (such as fresh mint, freshly brewed espresso or ground chili pepper).
Play a naughty movie drinking game. Grab your favorite bottle of wine or alcohol, along with a good adult film and play the naughty movie drinking game. Choose a random word, name or action in the movie. When that cue becomes apparent take swig of your beverage until the film ends (hopefully you won’t be passed out).

Look for rocks, plant leaves and flowers, or insects you can preserve and keep on display. Take a walk down to a beach and look for sea glass. Another way is to begin to invest in an object you wish to collect, such as saving bottle-caps you’ve found on the ground or gotten from your beverages.


Others can help you begin or grow a collection by bringing you items such as coins or snow globes back home as gifts.
Also consider buying a book on collectibles or joining a club of fellow enthusiasts.;
, Many arts and crafts can be started with few materials. Writing, sculpting, drawing, and more will likely be available to you simply by using what you already have on hand. In addition, you can go to various stores, including dollar and thrift stores, to supplement your projects with cheap material such as scrap wood, fabrics, or metal.Search for craft projects on sites such as craftster.org or Pinterest and join art groups on Reddit.
Look around your house before you begin. Often unused material can give you an idea for a project or help you complete one at low cost. You can use old electronics, wood, fabric, or paint to make miniatures, for example.
Retail stores have some cheap supplies, such as coloring books and paint-by-numbers kits. Hobby stores will also have kits that can help you start doing activities such as building model planes or whittling.

, Think of a subject you’d like to learn. Search out the institutions in your area. Your local community center or library may offer free classes on anything from square dancing to programming, but you can also search local colleges and businesses for inexpensive classes.Sites such as khanacademy.org and coursera.org offer free classes on a variety of subjects.
Youtube, podcasts, and phone applications are a great way to start. For example, try the free Duolingo application to learn a language.

, Youtube contains a vast quantity of music you can listen to for free. In addition, you can discover music you like by using online radio stations or services including Pandora and Spotify. By taking time to expose yourself to new music, you can turn music into a relaxing hobby without having to by albums.


Afterwards, you can go onto a discussion site such as sputnikmusic.com to rate and review music.

, Singing is an activity you can get into before you make a purchase. Sites such as karasongs.com are a place to start to find free karaoke tracks. To learn an instrument, you can also borrow or buy a used or beginner instrument and try to teach yourself using beginner books or a site such as guitarlessons.com

, The world outside has a lot of hobbies you can start with no cost. Explore the surrounding landscape with hiking or geocaching. Watch birds, look at the stars, go camping, or garden at home.Use geocaching.com to download coordinates of capsules you can track down around your environment.

, Search your area for local activities such as sports leagues or yoga shops. Many times these are free or cheap community-driven activities. You can also find or organize pickup games in public parks. Ride a bicycle around the community, learn to juggle, or sign up for a martial art at the YMCA., Games are like sports and often benefit from being shared in the community. Game groups will often supply board games or video games at no cost to you. In addition, libraries and schools may have video game groups for children and adults. You can also play a wide variety of games online or play card games with people around you.Use a site such as meetup.com to see what groups are in your area.

, If you can think of a personal interest to explore right away, you have an easy place to start. Otherwise, try to think of a hobby that might appeal to you. Think of what makes you feel good or creative now. What feels fun? What did you like to do in the past? Focus on these answers and start exploring how you can start the hobby at a reduced cost.Remember that you can change focuses as you go. Don’t be afraid to try out different hobbies. Borrow equipment or sell what you don’t need.

, A hobby that makes you money pays for itself. Many of these, such as needlework, don’t require much of investment to begin. Others, such as reselling, may require a more intensive investment to start but pay for themselves in time. Many hobbies have the potential to be monetized.The first goal with a hobby should be enjoying yourself. For example, when writing a blog or making online videos, don’t expect to get paid. It may never happen.

, Something you already have to do can be adapted into a hobby. You will have to cook to be able to eat, but you can make cooking a passion using recipes that utilize low-cost ingredients. These activities can add to your life, making small expenses worth it.Other examples include couponing and thrift shopping to make a hobby out of saving money on necessities.

, Go online, to class teachers, or find hobbyists and ask those who are experienced in your potential hobby for the minimum cost of materials you need to start. This will help you judge whether or not a hobby fits into your budget. You’ll often be surprised that you don’t need as much equipment as you imagined.


Many of them will have tips on how you can save more money. They were in your position at one time.

, Look around you before you begin a hobby. See what you can use out of the materials laying around your house. Do it yourself craftsmanship means you can fix your home, repair broken materials such as computers, or make objects you can give away or sell.Use your imagination. Get creative with the material you have. For example, you can shape a figurine out of old wood or metal. Look online for ideas if necessary.
Writing and journaling can also be done with little to no added expense by using any stray paper, notebooks, or a computer.

, You don’t need to go all out to fund your hobby. Home crafting hobbies can be done for very little. Go online to a site such as eBay or a bulk store to get a lot of material at once. You can also purchase used clothing or get fabric scraps from a fabric shop for needlework hobbies such as sewing, for example.A cheaper option for a technology hobby is to rebuild old or broken computers. You can buy a computer or get it from someone you know.
Selling creative products you make from cheap material helps you continue to fund your hobbies.
You can always find beginner kits, such as paint-by-number sets or guitars that cost a fraction of an official model. These can be found at retail stores.

, Equipment costs don’t have to get in the way of finding a hobby. At first you can rent the necessary equipment and try out your hobby. If you wish to continue with the hobby, you can continue to rent until you wish to buy your own equipment. Speak to people involved in your hobby to find places to rent equipment or try to borrow from people you know.Renting is useful for outdoor hobbies such as skiing or kayaking.
Renting can also help you down the road for situational problems during your hobby, such as when you require a specific tool to use once in metalworking or gardening.
Groups are also good for borrowing equipment. For instance, in a board game group, you can enjoy the games others bring without having to supply any games yourself.
Computer companies also offer month-long trial versions of their products. Photo editors, for instance, can download Photoshop and buy after the trial.

, If you can’t or don’t want to borrow, you can always get your own equipment. Thanks to the Internet, reseller websites are everywhere. This makes it very easy for you to get anything from a working musical instrument to a soldering iron to books and video games to test or continue your hobby.

, Many hobbies also begin by a parent or friend bringing home a gift. If there’s a hobby you are thinking of trying or continuing, someone else may be able to help you. This is good for collecting. If you’re interested in stamps, you can have friends and family save some for you and bring back more when they travel.Online communities are also good ways to get into hobbies. Some people will be willing to send you stamps or exchange yours for other ones, for example.

Look at what interests you.,
Think about what you value most.,
Examine your skills and personality.,
Pay attention to what excites your passion.",How to Find a Hobby1," Examine what takes up your spare time, when you have it. Do you enjoy reading books? Maybe you want to try your hand at writing them. Do you like a cold beer at the end of the day? Maybe your hobby could be trying to brew beer at home. Turn what you already love into a hobby.;
, What traits do you prize? Do you value wisdom or courage? Do you feel drawn to people who give back? Do you admire artistic expression? Let those traits guide you when choosing a hobby.


For instance, maybe you could volunteer at a library as a hobby because you value education, or maybe you could take up painting because you admire people who can express themselves with art.

, Certain hobbies require certain skill sets.


If you don't have a great deal of patience, then maybe hand sewing isn't something you'd enjoy. However, if you love tinkering and building things, maybe you should consider a hobby like working on older cars or building furniture. Play to your strengths., The way you talk about issues can also reveal your passions and those passions can be developed into a hobby.


Think about the topics you go on endlessly about. Ask your friends and family what you seem to talk about the most. Now, think about what it is about that subject that you enjoy so much and determine how it can be transformed into a hobby. For instance, maybe you are passionate about local politics, and getting involved at a grassroots level could become your hobby.

, Your library will have how-to books on a variety of topics. Browse through them to find topics that interest you, which can turn into new hobbies., Your time is precious, and you have a limited supply. Be sure to create space in your day for your new hobby by allocating a few minutes everyday for trying it out., Certain websites are dedicated solely to exploring hobbies, and you can use them to figure out what you'd like to do with your time.

, The first one you try might not be the right fit. Don't be afraid to move on and try something else. You have a right to decide when you're not interested in something., That is, don't be afraid to say ""yes"" to activities you normally bow out of. Maybe going to the art museum doesn't sound very exciting to you, but when your friend invites you to go, give it a try anyway. You might find a hobby you never expected to enjoy, such as painting or art restoration.

, One thing that may be holding you back from trying something new is you thinking, “I’m not that kind of person.” Maybe you think you're not brave enough or social enough for certain activities. Don't be afraid to step outside those boundaries.


For instance, consider all those crazy hobbies that you've dismissed because you thought you couldn't do them. Maybe you've always wanted to learn the guitar or how to ballroom dance but didn't think you had the talent. Sign up for a class anyway. Maybe you have a knack for it and don't even know it.

, Your friends already have similar interests and personalities that are compatible with yours, so you might enjoy their hobbies, as well. Ask them to show off their favorite hobbies and give you a taste for what they love to do.


For example, maybe your best friends are really into swing dancing. You can go with them to a lesson, or you can ask for a basic lesson from them before getting your feet wet.

, Community colleges offer a wide range of courses for very little tuition. Read through one, and you may find a class that sparks an interest.


You can request a catalog from most community colleges, though the majority have catalogs online to peruse.

Note where you spend your money.,
Create a budget.,
Decide how much of your budget you want to allocate to hobbies.,
Pick a free or inexpensive hobby if you don't have much wiggle room in your budget.",How to Find a Hobby4," Take a month to note down where you spend all of your money. You can use a smartphone app to help with this project, or you can rely mostly on your bank account if you don't use much cash.Separate out what you spend into categories. For instance, you can have categories such as ""groceries,"" ""gas,"" ""clothing,"" ""eating out,"" ""entertainment,"" ""rent,"" ""bills"" and ""fees."" You could also separate your bills into two categories: ones that are absolutely necessary, such as insurance, and ones that you may want to reduce or remove, such as cable and your phone.

, On a spreadsheet or app, identify what percentage of your money is taken up by necessary items, such as rent and bills. Also, use your last month's spending to see how much you spend on gas and groceries. Determine how much you have leftover for discretionary spending., If you are starting a new hobby, some money must come from other areas. For instance, you might want to cut down on other entertainment or stop eating out as much. Maybe you could spend less at the grocery store. How much you allocate depends on what hobby you choose, as some are more expensive than others.

, You have a number of options available to you if you need a cheaper hobby. For instance, you could read or write, take up running, or try gardening or camping."
"
Assess your budget.,
Think about the time commitment.,
Weigh in how social you are.",How to Find a Hobby You'll Stick With1," Some hobbies are more expensive than others. Before choosing a hobby, think about your personal budget. What can you reasonably afford?Some hobbies require a lot of equipment. If you want to take up a sport like, say, hockey, you will need protective gear, a stick, ice skates, and so on. This can get expensive fast, but if you have the money and are truly interested it may be worth it.
If you're on a budget, look for a hobby that's low cost. Something like knitting, for example, only requires basic supplies like needles, yarn, and some scissors. While you'll have to put some money towards this hobby, you can find many of these supplies for a lower cost online, at a department store, or at a craft store.;
, If you're very busy, you may not want an incredibly time consuming hobby. However, if you have a lot of free time on your hands, a hobby that requires a lot of time may help you stay busy.Things like reading, drawing, or crossword puzzles can be done in small spare moments. You can do these things on your lunch break or after dinner at night. They do not require a lot of time. These may be good if you're already busy.
Other hobbies require a great deal of free time. Something like gardening, for example, must be done for a set number of hours each day. If you have a lot of free time to fill, opt for a hobby like this.

, Be honest with yourself about your need for socialization. If you're a more social person by nature, you're unlikely to stick with a solo hobby. If you tend to prefer to spend time alone, a hobby you do with others may not interest you.If you need the motivation of others, joining a sports team or a book club can be an excellent hobby as it forces you to interact with others.
If you're a more introverted person, something you do alone, like reading, may be a better choice.

"
Think about what excites you.,
Evaluate your natural skill set.,
Consider whether you want a challenge.,
Make a list of things you already like.",How to Find a Hobby You'll Stick With2," You want to pick a hobby that makes you feel enthusiastic. If you don't go into your hobby feeling excited, you're likely to lose interest. Think about things you find fascinating and stimulating when choosing a hobby.Think about skills you have always fantasized about having. Have you occasionally imagined yourself as a talented singer? Teaching yourself to sing in your spare time may be exciting for you. Have you always wanted to impress people with your art? Try taking up drawing or painting.
Reviewing your past can help. What subjects did you love in school? What extracurricular activities from high school or college were most thrilling for you? This can offer hints on what kinds of hobbies you may enjoy as an adult.

, For some people, a hobby should be more relaxing than challenging. Choosing something you're not already good at may result in you feeling stressed and quitting. Think about what skills you already have if you're looking for something low key.For example, maybe you already enjoy cooking for yourself each night. You're not terribly skilled, but you're a decent cook and have always been up for new recipes.
You could take a cooking class. As you already know the foundations of cooking, it'll be easier to get into the swing of things with this new hobby.

, Some people get bored developing established skills. If you're the type of person who craves a challenge, you may want to find a hobby that pushes you out of your comfort zone a little.For example, maybe you're slightly sedentary by nature and are a bit resistant to going out. You could try running or hiking, both of which force you to get out and move.

, It's important to choose a hobby that reflects your personal interests. You're vastly more likely to stick to a hobby that interests you. Make a list of all the interests you can think of. Then, review the list. Think of what kind of hobby may match with your interests.For example, you may write down things like words, books, language, culture, trivia, and so on. A good hobby may be doing crossword puzzles, which will force you to think logically about words and use your trivia knowledge to decipher clues.

"
"
Find a friend to do the hobby with you.,
Look for a community.,
Start small.,
Have some patience when trying something new.,
Do not force yourself to continue a hobby you do not like.",How to Find a Hobby You'll Stick With3," Many people find the buddy system works when starting a hobby. If you and a friend agree to get into a hobby together, you'll both be more likely to stick it out. You will be able to keep one another accountable.Choose a friend with compatible interests. If you have a friend who's into extreme sports, while you tend to like staying in with a book, the two of you will not be a good match hobby-wise.
Instead, choose an equally bookish friend. The two of you could try joining a local book club together.

, Many people find it's easier to stick to a hobby if there's community support. Try joining a class or club related to your hobby. If you like singing, for example, join a local choir.If you tend to be more solitary, you can look for support online. If you're a knitter, for example, you can post in forums asking for advice and inspiration involving new knitting projects.

, If you jump into a hobby too quickly, you may grow impatient and quit. Do not think you have to commit all your time and energy to a hobby right away. Start by doing your hobby for a set number of minutes each day. As you get more accustomed to the hobby, increase this number gradually.If you're trying to take up running, for example, try starting off with 5 to 10 minute runs and gradually increasing the length as you get more physically fit.

, If your hobby is something you've never done before, you're unlikely to be good at it right away. Have some patience as it takes time to build up a skill. Try to remind yourself why building this skill set is important to you so you'll have the motivation to keep going., You will never know whether you'll take to something if you don't try it. It's okay if you give a hobby a solid shot and decide it's not for you. A hobby is meant to help you de-stress and wind down. If it's doing the opposite, try something else. Remember, the hobby you're most likely to stick with long term is the one you like.

Ask your teen what makes them feel good about themselves.,
Ask your teen what they want to do.,
Determine if your teen already participates in hobbies.",How to Encourage a Teenager to Take Up a Hobby1," One way to help a teenager find a hobby is to focus on their strengths and what makes them feel good. Many teens may only focus on weakness or things they have failed at. Instead, emphasize anything that they enjoy doing or that makes them happy.For example, your teen may be interested in music, sports, computers, crafting, role playing games, or science.
A person doesn’t have to be good at a hobby to enjoy it. Hobbies aren’t necessarily talents. If your teen loves to play an instrument or a sport but is just mediocre, that’s okay! As long as they feel good while doing it, it can turn into a hobby.;
, Maybe your teen has been wanting to try something for a long time but has been unsure if you would agree to it. However, you might just get a shrug in response. That is normal; asking ""what do you want to do?"" is a pretty vague and broad question. Tell your teen to think about it, and then ask them about it later.Try asking, ""What would you like to do today?"" or ""What do you want to do this weekend?"" You might also try saying, ""Let's do something you are interested in today. What would you like to do?""
If your kid wants to cook often or likes to be outside, you may be close to figuring out a good hobby for them.

, Teenagers spend much of their life away from the eyes of parents and don’t always offer up information. As a result, sometimes adults are not entirely aware that adolescents are developing hobbies. Your child may be developing hobbies away from home, so you may not have to encourage them to adopt new ones. Instead, you can support their current hobbies.Ask your teen if they have any hobbies or what they enjoy doing at other people’s houses. Be supportive of their activities so you can encourage a dialogue between the two of you.

Brainstorm ideas with your teen.,
Have the teen make an interest list.,
Analyze the teen’s personality.,
Search for opportunities you think your teen might like.,
Suggest ideas for interests.",How to Encourage a Teenager to Take Up a Hobby2," Teens need time to think about what their passions and interests are, especially if they don’t already know. Support them as they try to figure out what enjoy and try new things. You may even brainstorm with them. List all ideas, even if they sound stupid or impossible at first. Sometimes a flippant remark ends up being a brilliant idea!Good ideas for hobbies include fencing, reading or drawing manga, creating movies or music, cooking, playing an instrument, participating in quiz bowl, playing board or RPG games, or crafting.

, After brainstorming, have your teen write down a list of interests they would like to pursue or be curious about. Then, have the teen rank the interests on a scale from 1 to 10, with one being most likely to try and 10 being least likely.For example, your teen might list cooking, basketball, board games, video games, reading, and hiking. After they make the list, have them put them in order based on which ones they want to do the most.
This list can help your teen start figuring out what they are more interested in so they can try the activity. If they don’t like the activity, they can move on to the next activity on the list.

, A person’s personality can help them figure out hobbies or interests. Think about your teen. What are their character traits? What things do they get in trouble for doing? What do they gravitate towards? The answers to these questions can help them come up with ideas.For example, if your teen is chatty, they may enjoy something like debate, volunteer work, or drama. If your teen would rather be outside than doing homework, they may be interested in nature or sports.

, A good time for looking into new opportunities is in a transition phase, like before a new school year or at the start of the summer holidays. These are times that various organizations, clubs, and teams are starting up.You can look for camps or extra-curricular activities. At schools and camps, there is usually a system where teens are exposed to and encouraged to try out various interests.

, If your teen is struggling to find interests, you can gently suggest things they might be interested it. You have likely known your child their entire life, so you will have an idea of what their interests are.For example, you can say, ""You like being outdoors. Have you thought about running, hiking, or camping?"" or ""There's a teen program for crafts this summer. I thought you might be interested.""
Remember, it is easy to go from insightful and helpful to nagging and suffocating. Teenagers dislike being pushed into things by parents, and it may take finesse to coax adolescents into action.
Mention possible enjoyable activities, but limit the number of times you suggest the idea.

"
"
Be supportive of your teen’s hobbies.,
Structure life to support hobbies.,
Participate in a hobby of your own.,
Respect your teen’s changing interests.,
Remember that your teen may not share your hobbies.",How to Encourage a Teenager to Take Up a Hobby3," Encourage your to stick with their and have fun with what they are doing. Some teens may have unique or odd hobbies that you don’t understand. Don’t discourage them or tell them how weird you find it. This could hurt a core part of your teen’s personality. Instead, support their interests.It would be terrible to convince your teen to do something and then be too busy to help them enjoy it. Always be proud of what your teen accomplishes.
If you know a lot about the hobby, offer a small amount of constructive criticism if asked.
Avoid taking over a project. Remember, this is their hobby and project, not yours.

, One of the most important things you can do is help structure family life so that there is time to enjoy hobbies.This means making sure there is some free time for the teen, along with making sure this free time is not devoured by things like video games, social media, and TV.Provide resources and support. You are probably the one in charge of funding the hobbies to some extent. You may also have knowledge, expertise, and social connections that might help out.
Place limits on media use. For example, no video games after dinnertime. Instead, your teen can spend time on their hobby.
Avoid over-scheduling. Sometimes there is a fine line between a happily occupied, busy kid and one that has no time to just hang around with friends at the comic book store.

, You are most likely to get a positive response to your teen choosing a hobby if you engage in hobbies. By participating in a hobby, you are modeling how rewarding and fun hobbies can be and how important they are for a balanced life.For example, if you want your child to read for fun, model this behavior by reading in your spare time and talking about books.

, Teenagers are constantly changing, growing, and discovering new things. If your child does not want to do a hobby, respect it. A teen may have been really excited about knitting last year, but not this year.Insisting your teen finish a class, camp, or semester is sometimes a tough call. Some teens have a tendency to give up too easily and need a parent to help prevent them from quitting too quickly. Generally, insisting on finishing a certain amount of time will help prevent that, like a week-long tennis camp. However, if it really looks like a teen is not having fun, discontinuing the hobby may well be wise.

, Sure, doing things together is one of the great pleasures of being a parent. But parents and children may not share the same hobbies. The idea behind hobbies is to enjoy it for its own sake, whether or not your child shares the same hobbies. Don’t force your teen to like only what you like or discourage hobbies that you do not understand.For example, it may be easy to make fun of a teen's achievements in Minecraft. But doing so would certainly put them off to opening up to you.
Sometimes you may not think you have the exact same interest, but discover they are not so different. For instance, maybe your teen shows no interest in playing poker, but they love getting together and playing role-playing games.

"
"
Realize that your teen is busy.,
Provide opportunities for your child to participate in hobbies.,
Suggest an activity with friends.,
Avoid forcing your teen to do any hobby.",How to Encourage a Teenager to Take Up a Hobby4," Though you want your teen to cultivate all sorts of hobbies and interests, teenagers are very busy people. There are many things that occupy their time beyond school, such as sports, homework, work, volunteering, test prep, and driver's education. They may not have as much time for hobbies as they did a few years ago.On top of this, teenagers are also developing their own social life, which requires meeting up with friends, having romantic relationships, going to social events, and keeping in touch on text and social networks. Your teen may not have as much time to engage in hobbies as it may seem at first glance.

, You should encourage your child to engage in their hobbies, but do not demand it or put a lot of pressure on them. Forcing a teen to do something they do not want to do may result in the opposite outcome than you want.For example, if you think your teen would enjoy sailing, a summer camp that offers sailing lessons is a great way of exploring. However, if they do not ultimately like sailing, that should be fine too.

, Maybe your teen acts they could care less about a specific activity, but often teens will become interested if you let them do it with a friend. Suggest to your child that they join a club with a friend or bring a friend along when you take them to do the activity.For example, your child may enjoy cooking classes more with a friend instead of alone.

, If you are tempted to force your teen to try something, it is unlikely to end well. It will only lead to resentment. There is probably a reason your teen didn't want to do the activity in the first place. Hobbies should be fun and geared towards a person’s interest, so forcing your teen to do anything goes against that idea.If you are desperate, have your teen try something for just a week. Then stress that you'd really like them to continue, but in the end, this decision is not yours to make.
