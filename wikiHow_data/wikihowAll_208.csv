Make a quick backup now.,
Decide what you value.,
Beware of sinking time, and data, into online services.,
Start making backups.,
Use online backup services carefully.,
Don't forget your mobile devices.,
Consider licensing your work under a Creative Commons license, or otherwise providing an easily-downloadable copy for other people to archive.,
Keep an eye on your storage media.,
Consider how much of the digital record of you is other people's data, and consider preserving some of that.,
Remember that your backups are only useful insofar as you have software to read it.",How to Keep Your Digital Memories Safe," If nothing else, get a cheap USB stick and drag-and-drop your documents folder onto it. Worry about the other things later. You should do more than this, but it's most important to take the most valuable, irreplaceable information from your hard drive and put it on a second medium to guard against hard drive failure, theft or loss.Stop reading until you have done this and stop making excuses to not do it.

, Some questions to ask yourself are:


Would you care if this was deleted tomorrow? For things like business accounts and documents, the answer is of course you would. This kind of thing should be your first priority.






Would you care if you had no record of this in ten years' time? Alternatively, if you're old enough to remember what happened a decade ago, What happened a decade ago that you wish you had a record of today? Your picture of your cat might not matter too much now, but you would probably think differently after your cat passed away.






How replaceable is this data? MP3s and movies you have downloaded are generally replaceable (even if it's a pain to do so), so it's not the end of the world if they get lost. Documents you have written or photos you have taken cannot easily be re-created.






How good are you at assessing the value of items? As human beings, our choice of things to back up will be fallible and probably short-sighted. Err on the side of backing up too much stuff; disk space is cheap and 23 cubic inches holds a fantastic amount of data.






, This isn't to say that you must never post a picture on Facebook or say anything on Twitter; these things are fun. But remember that no online service should be considered an archive or a permanent home. Sometimes these services go down. Other times, your account there might be suspended or your data lost by accident.


Never sink time into any service that doesn't give you an easy way to get your data out again. If it doesn't allow you to download all of your stuff as either a ZIP file or with some automated tools via an API, it's probably a bad idea to use it.

Keep a current email address for any services you use in case the service goes down. If they give you any notice, it will likely be via email.

Keep local copies of everything. Don't delete your local copies after you've put something online unless you are totally, 100 percent sure that you will never want to see it again.

Watch out for signs of impending doom, either for your data or for the service as a whole. These are some of the signs that you should consider moving your data somewhere else and be doubly vigilant of having local copies of your work:


Unclear or unsustainable business model. Have fun with these services, but as with any service, don't count on it being around next year.

Losing data or extended periods of downtime should make you consider whether you want to continue being there at all. Fotopic was a fine example of this; after suffering several periods of downtime, at least one of them extended, people continued to put their photos on the site before it was shut down, with no notice, in 2011.

Reports of deletion of accounts by staff of the site. One does not even need to discuss whether they might actually have a good reason for doing so to note that this happens rather a lot to people who are not expecting it on many of today's social networking sites.

A buy-out of the service by another company that has no clear plans for its future. In particular, beware of talent acquisitions which might leave the service orphaned; the 2012 acquisition of Posterous by Twitter is a great example of this, if you're good at reading between the lines., Remember, something is better than nothing. Diminishing returns apply in backups as they do with everything else. The cheapest and simplest backup methods take care of an overwhelming majority of likely loss-of-stuff. Over-complicating your backup strategy is the biggest trap: the more complicated and expensive you insist on making it, the less likely you are to do it.
Thus, while they have good intentions when they're not showing everyone else how awesome they are, people who tell you that you absolutely must go all-out with geographic redundancy probably do more harm than good to the extent that such things are necessary if you're going to have backups at all.


First level: Buy a cheap USB flash drive and shove your documents folder onto it. You already did this in the first step; do it right now if you have not. This saves your most important data from the medium most likely to fail or be stolen.

Second level: Once you have figured out what you value, buy a USB external hard drive and start copying more of your data onto that. Get into the habit of doing this at least every week. You'll have more space to play with, so you can copy the more replaceable stuff like your music collection onto it. You will also want to look into ways to download data from your online accounts (for example, backing up your blog, or using Facebook's export-to-a-big-ZIP-file feature) so you can back that up, too.






Third level: Consider some automated backup strategy. This is worth it if you care to do it, but takes more time to set up well; a poorly-designed one will result in more of your data getting lost than a simple regular manual backup if it doesn't alert you to failures of the media to which you are backing up.

Fourth level: Geographic redundancy, for stuff that you absolutely cannot lose. This takes care of, say, your house burning down. The diminishing returns are in action; this is a whole lot less likely than a hard drive dying, and of course if your house is destroyed, you're likely to be a lot more worried about finding somewhere to live and starting over again than you are about your cat photographs.

, They have their place, particularly in the case of possible geographic redundancy, but never depend on them as your only backup source. Once again never delete your local copies of anything, and never use a service that does not provide you an easy way of getting your data out. Because of their widespread use for illegal purposes, ""file locker"" services are an especially bad place to house your data as they can disappear literally overnight.
, For many people, they have supplanted or replaced conventional computers. Back up your photographs and video from your camera phone., If your stuff is interesting enough, allowing other people to make copies will result in lots of copies of your stuff being out there.
Many places will accept copies of Creative Commons-licensed content; Wikimedia Commons will accept any media you have created yourself if it's vaguely educational, for example. The Internet Archive at http://www.archive.org/ will also accept collections of digital artifacts. Consider contributing to these or another similar non-profit project., If one of your backup drives fails, replace it immediately. ""The universe tends towards maximum irony; don't push it.""In the longer term, you'll want to move your data off various kinds of storage media as obsolescence sets in and move it onto newer ones once the newer technologies mature. Floppy disks went to the glue factory a decade ago, for example, and are quickly becoming unreadable. Writable CDs and DVDs are headed down this path; if you have data backed up on these, get them onto hard drives or solid-state media now.


 The CD-RW is quickly going the way as the floppy disk, and USB will be gone one day, too. Move your stuff onto newer media as the newer media matures.

, An old example of this would be your bookmarks; at the very least, keep a backup of your bookmarks file. In the Facebook era, many of your digital memories will have been made by other people; for example, photos in which you have been tagged, or tweets mentioning you. In many jurisdictions it is legal to make personal copies of other peoples' stuff provided that it is strictly for personal use., Many people who used computers in the 1980s and 1990s have already experienced the pain of finding that today's software is unable to read their documents.


Beware of software that forces you to keep using it. An example would be a photo manager that wants to import your photo library but doesn't document how your files are stored or how to get them out again. Another example (fortunately uncommon these days) would be music download services that allow you to purchase tracks but use copy protection with the explicit aim of stopping you from making copies. This especially applies to backup software; if no other program can read whatever format in which it stores your files it's useless as a long-term solution.

Beware of proprietary or weird file formats. This is the more general case of the above: Some vendors do not document their file formats precisely because they don't want you to be able to read your own stuff with anyone else's software. If your software permits it, export a copy of your work to some open file format. If your software does not allow you to do this, panic and start using an open-source alternative.

Stick to file formats that can be read by open-source software today. Open source software tends to stick around longer than closed-source software does, so even if you're using proprietary software you'll be able to open it in open source software long after the vendor of your software stops supporting it.

Practice writing skills: Writing skills such as simple grammar, spelling, sentence structure and nominalization are all important for those who wish to be decent story writers.,
Create an outline: Before you begin your novel, it is a good idea to have a general idea of the plot.,
Create your characters: Sometimes it can be difficult to think up characters that are believable, and your characters can seem very abstract.,
Create a location: A novel isn't complete without a scene.,
Open your mind: Writers block is very common, so if you are experiencing it try to open your mind with other 'artsy' activities, such as painting, reading or drawing.,
Search for inspiration: Still stuck?,
Imagine yourself in the novel.,
Read plenty: If you really want to be a decent novel writer, it would be wise to read decent books.,
Take heed of children: Children have the most amazing imaginations, so if you are ever stuck for ideas listen to what the youngsters have to say.,
Practice sentence structure: If you just can't seem to get your sentences to flow try reading other stories and observe how the author has structured their sentences.,
Avoid going over the top: Once you have a good idea you may find yourself getting carried away, when this occurs be sure to read over your writing a few times, you may find some of your ideas have already been used or your idea is just plain boring.",How to Be a Decent Story Writer," It is also important to expand your vocabulary. Do this by keeping a dictionary close by when reading in-case you run into any words you are not familiar with. When ever you have the time, look up synonyms for different words and practice grammar, sentence structure, and other forms of writing skills such as nominalization, descriptive paragraphs, etc. This will help broaden your knowledge of English and you will find your writing more fluent.;
, If the plot is unclear you may find clashing ideas later on in the story so be sure to have a good idea of it before you begin. Be sure to stay away from common ideas and try to create your own unique story line. For example, the story line of the rogue sorceress conquering the world is incredibly clichéd and over used. Think up your own unique story.

, If you are finding this is a problem you could always try basing your characters on someone you know in real life; give them a similar personality, similar physical traits, or a similar name. By doing this you will be able to form a clear image of the character in you head. Be sure to ask permission if you plan on basing your character completely on someone you know. Obviously you can write a decent novel about events that actual occurred, such as the novel, A Captain's Story by Richard Phillips or Touching the Void by Joe Simpson. If your decent novel is about something that really happened, you don't have to create characters.

, Choose where your characters will live; what town, what country, maybe even what world? If you are thinking of writing a fantasy novel it may be difficult to come up with a scene. Open your mind and consider every possibility. It is a good idea to carry a notebook and pen with you wherever you go, as you may see something that inspires a great scene for your novel. If your story is not fantasy / sci-fi, consider using real town names and cities (but be sure to do your research on the town first).

, Another good way to clear your mind is by exercising. Activities such as walking, going to the beach, yoga and meditation can really open up your mind, so give them a go. If none of these methods work for you, there are other ways to open your mind. Try the brainstorming method, write down all the words that come to mind until you feel like your mind has 'expanded'.

, Now would be the time to search for inspiration. Inspiration can be found in the smallest things; music, art work, poems, even the night sky. Watch the world around you, there are many potential stories just waiting to happen. To make sure no potential story goes to waste, always carry a small notebook and pen in your bag and write down ideas that arise. Also, consider your dreams as a potential novel. Yes, dreams may be abstract, but they are also stories just waiting to happen!

, Pretend you are there, inside your story, living the life of your characters. This will give you a sense of how real your story feels. By doing this you can also get a feel of the emotions your characters should be portraying in your novel. Put yourself in the shoes of the character to create real emotions and reactions.

, Reading books daily can expand your mind and English capabilities. Readers gain many benefits from reading, as well as new ideological beliefs and an open mind. If you prefer to stick to mainly one particular genre, try to expand your horizons and read many genres. For example, if you only read fantasy novels, try to begin reading a mystery novel. It is always good to approach life with a ready mind that is open to new ideas.

, If a child is telling you an anecdote be sure to listen carefully, or if you come across children playing a game observe for a little while, (of course you won't want to come off as 'creepy', remember this is all in good nature). If you have children of your own or if you have younger siblings you can look towards them for inspiration. True, at first some anecdotes told by children can seem far fetched, but when done correctly these anecdotes or 'child games' can turn into a brilliant idea for a story.

, You can use their sentences or paragraphs as an outline to help you get started.

, If this is the case, don't be disheartened, but persevere. Writing should be an enjoyable experience and you will know you have done a good job once you are feeling content towards your novel.

Think about your personality.,
Think about the pony's personality.",How to Think of a My Little Pony Cutie Mark1," If you are sweet and caring, then don't choose a deep blue or black. Likewise, if you are secretive and mysterious, don't choose pink or neon colors. If you have a favorite color, choose that for the basic color. If you have already got a color in mind, definitely use that.;
,


Don't fall for the trick that lighter colors are more attractive. Look at Luna, for example; she is pretty but is quite a dark blue.
If the pony has a personality different from yours, try to think from her point of view.
If your pony has two personalities, choose both and gradient the relevant colors in.
If you feel uncomfortable choosing a color that represents her personality, that's okay!

Find the carotid pulse. To feel a pulse on the side of the neck just below the jawline, place your index and middle fingers in the hollow between the windpipe and the large muscle in the neck. Press lightly until you feel a pulse. This is sometimes easier than finding the pulse in your wrists.;
, Use a watch or clock with a second hand or digital second display. Count the number of times you feel a throb for one minute (60 seconds). This is the most accurate method.


If you're in a hurry, you could count the beats you feel for 15 seconds and multiply by four or count beats for 30 seconds and multiply by two. These options will work but are not quite as accurate as counting for a full minute.

, The normal resting heart rate for an adult is 60-100 beats per minute. Normal heart rate for children under 18 is 70-120 beats per minute. . This applies to a person who is at rest. Any physical activity will increase the pulse rate.

, The strength of your pulse cannot be calculated precisely, but experienced professionals will characterize a pulse as ""weak"", ""faint"", ""strong"", or ""bounding"". This is an indication of the health of the heart and vascular system. , You're looking for regularity of pulsations and the pauses between them. If your pulse is steady, note it as ""regular."" If you detect a skip or other fluctuation in the pulse, it may be termed ""irregular."" This is not necessarily a cause for alarm, but if you note a consistent irregularity, you should seek medical advice (as noted below). , Place the tips in different places and stop at each location for five seconds.

, Sometimes either lightening your touch or pressing harder will help you find a pulse.

, Holding your hand up near your head can make your pulse less distinct. Dropping your hand will slightly alter your blood flow through that wrist and make it easier to detect a pulse.

, If you have such an instrument, use it here. Lift up or remove your shirt, hold the stethoscope against your bare chest, and listen. Count each beat as you hear it, and listen for any skipped beats.

, This is the highest your pulse rate can get. You will use your potential maximum heart rate to determine your target heart rate. To find yours, follow this formula: 220 - your age = predicted maximum heart rate.


Try exercising intensely for 30 minutes. Check your heart rate immediately after (or even during) your exercise. Compare your actual exercising heart rate to your potential maximum rate. The numbers should be fairly close.
If you're taking your pulse during exercise, keep your feet moving as you do so or blood might accumulate in your extremities.

, This is 60 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. The reason there is a range rather than a solid number is that everyone has a different fitness level. While you exercise, check your pulse for 15 seconds.

Pay attention to what they already know.,
Ask where they’re having trouble.,
Work together to set up goals.Create a mix of major and minor goals that can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time.,
Track the student’s progress.,
Open with questions about material covered in the last session.,
Help students meet their in-class requirements.,
Focus each session on a specific goal.,
Provide opportunities to succeed.While you should be working toward goals, you don't want to discourage your student by setting the bar too high.,
Give your students breaks.,
Adapt to student needs.You have goals laid out, but sometimes young people get worn down by their work, just like adults do.,
Cater your tutoring style to the student’s learning style.Not all children learn in the same way.,
End each session by looking forward to the next one.The end of a tutoring session doesn't mean the student is ""finished"" for the week.,
Build a personal relationship with your students.Your job is to help students perform up to their potential.,
Learn the student’s communication style.,
Show up for each session in a good mood.,
Act as a guide rather than teacher.Teachers and tutors have very different roles.,
Give students room to fall in love with the material.,
Communicate clearly with parents and teachers.",How to Be a Good Tutor," When first getting to know your students, you need to gauge what they already know, so you don't waste time in your sessions. Ask the student what they're good at and what they most enjoy about the subject you're working on. Let him or her speak open-endedly about the subject and show off for you. It will make the student feel smart and validated while letting you figure out what material they've already mastered.;
, Students are often quite aware of their weaknesses. They know what types of questions they consistently miss on quizzes, or what parts of class lectures make no sense to them. Let the student explain where they get lost, and make a list of those areas for your own reference.

, For example, a student may not be able to bring up a math grade within a month, but three months would be a good goal for grade improvement. Minor goals should be set for the short term: the student will write a 150-word summary of a major source for an upcoming research paper by the end of the session.


Write down the goals on a sheet of paper and have the student keep track of it. Putting them in charge of the ""goal tracker"" gives them more responsibility for their own improvement.

, Create a chart that allows you and your student to assess how well he or she is doing both in your sessions and in class. This chart can include entries for:


Quiz and test grades
Overall class grades
Achievement of the goals you set up together
Your evaluation of the student's effort
Your evaluation of the student's understanding of concepts
Celebrate improvement in qualitative assessments like grades with a lot of praise! If the student's grades aren't improving, but you see a lot of effort, your chart will help keep him or her from getting discouraged.

, Before moving on to new material, you want to make sure your student has mastered the old material. Ask one or two open-ended questions that will allow the student to display their understanding of concepts. If they struggle, you may need to revisit that information before moving on. Also allow the student to raise any questions of his or her own about previous material.

, Have your student inform you about projects and essays as soon as they receive their assignments. Break each project down into smaller parts and work through them together slowly, well-ahead of time. Not only will the graded assignment be of a higher quality, but you'll also model for the child how to manage their time effectively.


If teachers give out study guides for exams, gear the content of your tutoring sessions toward the material that will be covered.

, Depending on the student’s needs for a given class, you may be working on a paper or project, or you may be going over concepts from class. After reviewing old material, make a verbal plan about what you will achieve together in this session. Make sure to keep your goals manageable:


Today, we're going to work on the organization of this essay. We're just going to take the ideas you already have and put them in the best possible order in an outline.
Today, we're going to try to figure out the network of Allied forces in WWII. Next session, we'll work on the Axis countries.
Today, we're going to look at all the problems you got wrong on your last math test and try to figure out the right answers. Then, we'll do new problems that test the same concept.

, Every session should include exercises you know the student can complete successfully. From there, you can build on the lessons toward more complex exercises that may prove more challenging.


If the student doesn't perform at the level you expected, don't give up! Repeat the exercise until he or she completes it correctly. When they do, heap praise on the student for working through an obstacle.

, The breaks should be no longer than 5 minutes. Working for long stretches time might wear them out and make them lose focus. A 5-minute break is just enough time to refresh students without breaking stride in the work you're doing.

, If your student seems tired or in a bad mood on a given day, don't be afraid to mix things up a little and lighten the mood. For example, if you're tutoring a student in a foreign language, you might listen to and translate songs instead of going through conjugation exercises. You might watch cartoons in that language and see how much of the plot the student can follow.

, Some students work better alone, and will do better if given time to complete activities on their own. Others are more social learners who will learn more if it seems like you're working through the problems with them.


Aural students learn best through verbal explanation, so talk to them about concepts. Verbal students need to talk through concepts on their own, so be willing to sit back and listen.
Physical/tactile students need to work with their hands. Bring in 3D models if you're studying anatomy, or clay that they can shape into the different organs of the body.
Visual students might need graphic aids like pictures, charts, or educational videos.

, Make clear that you expect them to prepare for your next session in the time you're apart. If there's any work that wasn't finished during the session, assign it as homework for the next meeting. If you have a fun activity planned for the next session, give the student something to look forward to., As such, you're as much friend and cheerleader at times as you are instructor. By forming personal connections with students, you can more effectively motivate them to succeed.


Talk about how the subject makes them feel. Students who perform poorly in class may feel ashamed of it. When they improve, they may feel powerful and proud. Comfort them in their down times and celebrate their successes.
Share your own experiences of failure and how you overcame them.
Find out what their passions are, so you can make the tutoring sessions more interesting. A straightforward equation might seem boring, but a subtraction problem about fighting dinosaurs might perk up a student who loves dinosaurs.

, Connect to the student on their own terms. If a student is intensely shy, you can't ignore it! It may be that the student communicates best in the days between sessions, when he or she can email you questions. Sometimes students are reluctant to ask questions in person, even though they have many they need answered.

, Your students will pick up on your moods immediately. If you seem tired or low energy, they will mimic your tone. But, if you show up smiling and optimistic for every session, they'll follow your lead and put more effort into the work at hand.

, Teachers have many students to oversee at once, and must act as authority figures who pass on knowledge. Tutors work one-on-on, though, and are more like ""educated peers"" than authority figures. You only have one student to work with at a time, so you don't have to lecture. Let students take charge of learning objectives, and guide them toward their goals.


Ask a lot of questions. You don't want to lecture your students. Instead, ask open-ended questions that force them to come to conclusions on their own, with research you help them conduct.

, While you need to keep the student on track to achieve their goals, don't be afraid to give up a little control. If, when studying the Civil War, your student wants to spend a lot of time on an unimportant but dramatic battle, let it happen even if it eats up a whole session. A tutor should let natural curiosity grow rather than trying to smother it. The increased enthusiasm will pay off down the line.

, Without their help, you won't know how to focus the content of your sessions in a way that will help your students succeed in school. Talking to parents and teachers is especially important for younger students. While a high schooler might be able to explain course objectives to you, a third grader won't.


Reach out to the parents and teacher(s) and set up a regular schedule for communication.
You might speak to the parents every time the student is brought in for a tutoring session.
You might agree to email the teacher on the first Monday of each month to get a sense of what's coming down the pipe in the student's classwork.

Build relationships with students by establishing an inclusive classroom environment.,
Examine your privilege in order to be more open to conversations about race.",How to Be a Culturally Competent Science Educator," Texts and teacher guides for content areas often contain deeply embedded biases. For example, a science text may include only the contributions of white European men. Make sure to look for multiple forms of bias, including:


gender
socioeconomic status
sexual orientation
race
ethnicity;
, Make sure that they are inclusive of all groups listed above and can accommodate all reading levels, communication styles and intelligence. Look at case studies and readings about social issues related to science and determine how authentic they are to the students.

, Think about how you can support critical thinking, cultural discussion and celebration of differences. Engage students in the scientific inquiry process in order to allow them to use background knowledge and experiences to guide their own learning and promote meaning making.

, Use assessments that are accessible to students of all identities. You can do this by:


creating questions that are unbiased
offering support (modifications) where it is needed so each student has an opportunity to succeed
designing a format that includes multiple ways for students to demonstrate their learning, including drawing, writing, collaborating, working individually, going outside or moving around.

, Think about differences in culture and values when deciding how to best deal with the challenging behaviors of students. Don't shy away from or ignore instances of cultural conflict. Embrace them as learning opportunities for all.

,, Equity takes context into account and provides the same opportunity for learning for all students. Making opportunities available has different meaning for different students based on their needs. For example, students with language barriers may need more support accessing the academic language of science than others. Students with physical disabilities may need more support navigating the lab space than others.

, Students are more susceptible to ending up in prison if they attend lower income schools or belong to minority groups who are deemed unable to succeed by the school system. Push for programs that set high standards and achievement goals for all students.

, These may include:


cultural differences in language structure
differences in cultural capital (the types of knowledge that different cultures take value in).

, Work collaboratively to come up with solutions to address them.

, Determine what attributes give them that social power and use those attributes to motivate students in the classroom. Support students in succeeding academically to enable them to be a person of power.

, Find out about what struggles diverse students face in society, what policies are in place to enforce those struggles, and what can be done to take action against those policies. For example:


be open to having conversations with G.L.B.T. people and celebrate the diversity of all students
avoid using labels and stereotypes when addressing students and their circumstances.

,, Styles include:


linear (beginning, middle, end; students can explain a scientific process)
circular (context around a main point; students can create a visual that allows them to see a main point and how it is supported by the context )
direct (specific statements; students can write out the steps of an experiment that they designed)
indirect (suggestive statements; students can propose additional research or experiments that can be done with a concept)
intellectual confrontation (based on idea; students can argue their hypotheses and support them with evidence)
relational confrontation (based on relationship; students can problem solve during group work).

, Work to ensure that there is an open line of understanding, modifying communication where necessary. Send out a classroom newsletter that is easily translated. Make sure to notify parents what topics are being covered and when. Gain permission from parents for students to participate in lab activities and acknowledgement that they are aware of safety concerns (signature of a safety contract).

, An inclusive classroom environment:


focuses on learning in science
celebrates diversity of human life
allows students access into discussions where they are able to question what they are learning
lends itself to be shaped by the student's experiences and the uninhibited sharing of those experiences.

, Privilege might include:


race (white is seen as individual rather than culture group)
socioeconomic status (money is power)
higher education (may not be available to all students).

Go after specific information.,
Avoid being defensive.,

Thank them.",How to Ask for Feedback," Giving honest feedback can be intimidating; many will react badly to anything they might perceive as criticism. Understand this before you approach someone for feedback. Make them feel at ease by letting them know you appreciate honesty from them more than an attempt at not hurting your feelings.


”Hey Bill, I wanted to know your thoughts on how I did in the group project we worked on. Don’t worry about hurting my feelings, I want to know exactly how I did so I can improve.”;
, Of course, you’ll want to hear feedback on past blunders, but only so you’ll know how to avoid them. Ask how the situation could have been avoided. This will show that you’re looking for feedback in order to improve on yourself rather than dwell on past mistakes.


”Hey Professor X, I think I’m having some difficulty in meeting the course’s expectations. Can you let me know how I’m doing, and what I could be doing better?”, This will show to others you’re willing to receive it. Take frequent opportunities to ask for feedback, such as during an annual review, office hours with a professor or before an important project. This will also make people more comfortable when you do ask them for feedback; they’ll already know you’re thick-skinned enough to warrant honest truths.


There’s a key difference between asking for feedback regularly and always needing validation. If you find yourself asking for feedback after every little thing you do, people will think you’re insecure and might not give you honest feedback., Bring some timely, important information concerning projects you’re working on. This will make the interaction more of a conversation, making each of you more comfortable, while also making you come across as more helpful. This is especially important when getting feedback from your boss; it’ll make you seem more independent and reliable.


If you’ve overcome a setback in completing an assigned task, this could be useful information to bring. It might help avoid this setback in similar tasks in the future., When you do get a chance to ask for feedback, the last thing you want to do is show up unprepared. Before asking for feedback and advice, take some time to think about where you need them most. Taking the time to prepare beforehand will show you respect the person’s time and willingness to discuss things with you.


If you can, consider sending a list of these points by email before meeting with the person. This will let them give your request some thought before you meet, allowing for more effective feedback.
Keep your list short. Two or three points should be sufficient.
Examples of points you can mention are your performance on specific projects, specific flaws they think might need fixing or your attitude., Avoid asking only very specific or overly vague questions. Ideally, most of your questions should fall somewhere on the spectrum between these two options. Of course, you can have specific requests and more general questions, but you should mix and match the two categories. This will ensure that you receive a complete feedback, which will help you more effectively put it into action.


If you’re concerned about your performance on a specific project or task, definitely ask about it. You should also ask questions that encourage positive feedback, such as “What are some things I’m doing well?”, Whether the answers you’re getting are too vague or you’re just not exactly understanding what you’re being told, you shouldn’t let the matter lie. Don’t hesitate to ask them to clarify their point. Ask for examples.


For instance, if you’re told that your time management skills could use work, ask for an example of a situation that better time management could have improved. Do so politely, otherwise, you might not get the feedback you want., The best way to kill any chance of regularly getting constructive feedback is to interrupt the person to defend yourself. Either they’ll feel like they’re wasting their time and get discouraged, or they’ll try to be polite and stop giving feedback. Even if you’re told something, whether positive or negative, that you don’t agree with, avoid the urge to start a debate.


An important part of this is to better control negative reactions to criticism. This is imperative to getting the constructive feedback you’re looking for., This shows that you’re absorbing what you’re hearing while allowing you to save the feedback for later review. Reviewing feedback you’ve received by yourself will mean you’re not as likely to react as negatively as when you’ve just received it. Stopping to write also serves to break up the conversation naturally, which might encourage the other person to give you a bit more feedback., Show that you appreciate the time you were given. Being thankful for feedback, rather than reacting defensively, will make the person more likely to give you feedback if you ask again in the future. Reacting negatively could possibly harm your relationship with that person, especially if you went out of your way to ask them for it."

, Have a keen eye, and pay attention to the slightest details.

, Spoken lines sometimes indicate jokes or references meant to go over the heads of children, such as alcohol jokes, or pop culture quotes.

, Depending on the theme of the situation in a particular episode, you may find music that is strikingly familiar. Daniel Ingram, the show's musical composer, has slipped in pieces based on music from Batman, Legend of Zelda, and even a few cult classics such as ""Ride of the Valkyries"" and ""Road to Viridian City"".

, Animating can be a stressful job. To liven things up, animators sometimes cook up designs for ponies that are inspired by historical figures or other fictional characters. Time Turner and Daring Do, for example, are modeled after Dr. Who and Indiana Jones, respectively.

, It's not uncommon for cartoons to use the Wilhelm Scream or zany cartoon sounds, but My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic occasionally borrows original sound effects from other fictional works, such as Star Trek and Five Nights at Freddy's.

, Writers like to sneak in puns and jokes whenever they can. If you read the title, you may find puns such as Sleepless in Ponyville (a reference to Sleepless in Seattle) or Crusaders of the Lost Mark (a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark).

, The fashion choices of characters in the series can dish out several hidden references. If you're observant, you may notice clothing that resembles designs from Harry Potter, Metal Gear Solid, and Mortal Kombat.

Focus on the goal-setting part of the meeting.",How to Attend an IEP Meeting," A whole team will be working on your child's education, so it can help to get to know who will be there. You may only be able to familiarize yourself with their positions ahead of time, but that will help you navigate the meeting better.The team will usually include a regular education teacher, a special education teacher, someone from the school system who is familiar with the special education programs, someone knowledgeable in interpreting the evaluation results, and anyone else you invite who knows the child's abilities well, such as a daycare provider.Ahead of time, think about whether or not you want to bring anyone in particular. It can even just be a trusted friend who helps you take notes.;
, The IEP has standard parts, and knowing those parts beforehand can help you handle the meeting better. Of course, it will have things about where your child is at right now, including the ways their disability affects them. It will also have goals for your kid.There'll also be info on what services your child will get, as well as how long each day your kid will be apart from nondisabled children.
It will also lay out whether or not your child will be included in standardized assessments (the dreaded standardized tests), as well as how your kid's progress will be measured.

, Evidence is always helpful when it comes to this type of meeting, so don't be afraid to back yourself up with some help. Even if certain people can't be at the meeting, you can still bring statements from them. For instance, if your child's doctor has something important to contribute, you can ask them to jot something down about it for you to take., Before the meeting, your child will be evaluated to determine what help they need. You should be given access to this information, and it can be helpful to read this ahead of time. You may find that you disagree with certain parts, and that's important information to bring up at the meeting., Part of the meeting will be setting goals for the year. You should think about that ahead of time so you can be ready to speak up when the time comes.Think about your child's abilities. What do you think they can do in the next year? What would you like to see them do? Try to be realistic.
It might help to write down the goals to bring to the meeting.

, If you don't speak English as a first language, the district will usually provide an interpreter for you. You must ask at least 3 days ahead of time, though, so don't be afraid to speak up. Call the school to request one., The school has to make it so you or your partner can attend, meaning that they must give you sufficient notice. If they don't, you can ask them to reschedule. Usually, the meeting will be held at your child's school., One of the big things that you contribute to the meeting is talking about what your kid can do. You know your kid better than anyone, and you can help focus the discussion both on the places your kid can do well and the places they need help growing.You can also talk about your kid's interests, as well as things that only you know about.

, The evaluation is the professional assessment of your child. If you think something about the evaluation is wrong, you have a right to speak up. You may think that your kid has more ability than what was determined by the evaluation. On the other hand, you may think your child needs more help than what was established by the evaluation. Keep in mind, though, that school is likely to want some kind of support from you to back up your claims., Usually, you help create the IEP at the meeting. Sometimes, though, the school will have written out an IEP ahead of time. You may also be revising the IEP from the previous year. If you feel like something is wrong with it, let your voice be heard. You are your child's advocate.Also, don't be afraid to bring up suggestions about things you may want added to the IEP.

, These meetings may get a bit jargon-heavy at times, and the other team members likely don't even realize they're doing it. It's fine to ask questions. You're not expected to know every single piece of terminology ahead of time., Most schools suggest a child starts attending meetings at age 15 or 16. However, if you believe your child is able to understand what's going on at the meeting, it can be critical that they attend, even at a younger age. For instance, even upper elementary students may want to attend. They should be able to contribute to a conversation about their education.Some parents advocating for always bringing your child, as that gives all the evaluators a chance to see your child again. Some of them may have only had one interaction with your child. Also, having your child there helps to remind the team that their decisions affect an actual person.
Most schools will be open to this idea, but you may need to sell some schools on it.
Of course, you don't want to take your child kicking and screaming to the meeting. If they don't want to go, wait until the next year or whatever age they seem ready. Alternatively, maybe some kids just want to listen in the meeting and not speak up.

, Talk to your child about why the meeting is happening. If they don't know they are receiving extra help, the meeting isn't the time to spring it on them. Also, you should talk about how the meetings usually go so that your kid has a good understanding ahead time of what will happen., The goal-setting part of meeting is a good place for your kid to offer some suggestions. You may need to exclude them from other parts of the meeting to discuss certain things. You can discuss the more sensitive information at the beginning of the meeting, then invite your child in for the goal-setting. That's a great place for kids to advocate for themselves and take control of their education.Your kid may also want to be there for accommodations, where they are talking about the help your child may need on tests. That way, your child can ask for what they need.

, Are you a pianist? Give your pony a piano. Are you a writer? Give them a quill and ink.

, Depending on whether or not your OC is a representation of you, you can use symbols from any reach of pop culture. If you like Star Wars, use a lightsaber or Stormtrooper helmet.

, A cutie mark determines what your pony is destined to be good at. Do you have a job that you excel at? Granted, a burger grill or office cubicle probably won't tickle your fancy for a cutie mark, but think outside the box.

, Is your pony a crime-fighter vigilante? Give them a mask as a cutie mark.

, Is your OC based on or heavily influenced by a particular theme? Electronics, holidays, or even other fandoms. If your pony is say, Christmas-themed, give them a candy cane or holly wreath.

, You may or may not consider yourself an outstandingly virtuous person, but everyone has a significant virtue. Try referring back to the symbol studies. Come up with something that visually and accurately represents your virtue. A magnifying glass could represent curiosity, an hourglass could represent patience, a shield could represent perseverance, and so on.

, Think outside the box. The My Little Pony fandom is large and ever-growing, and only a fraction of those fans have OC's, but that's still a lot.

, If you like it, test how it looks on your pony.

, Once you have an eligible candidate for your pony, choose it and add it to your pony.

Think of a name.,
Create a backstory.,
Decide on your type of pony.,
Choose your pony's colors and appearance.,
Decide on a Cutie Mark.",How to Create a My Little Pony Original Character1," Come up with a name for your original character that says something about who your pony is. Draw inspiration from the names of characters on My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (TV show), or come up with your own ideas for a name.


If you're not sure how to think of a name, try coming up with a name similar to Fluttershy, one of the main characters on the show. Her name combines the physical characteristic of her being a pegasus (“flutter) with her personality characteristic of being timid (“shy”).
You can also come up with a name that has to do with what your pony does or likes. For example, Applejack is a pony from the series who is named as such because she works on her family’s apple farm.
Find name generators online if you need help creating a name for your original character.;
, Think about where your pony comes from, what inspires them, what’s happened to them, etc. Write these details down so you have a complete picture of your original character beyond just an image.


Jot down a few key facts about your pony, like its gender, favorite color, favorite food, etc. You can also write several sentences of description or even a whole story that goes into your pony’s backstory.
Think about your favorite characters in TV shows, movies, books, and video games. What are their backstories? What makes you like them? Draw inspiration from these characters when coming up with your backstory.It’s a good idea to come up with a backstory before you decide on aspects of your pony’s physical characteristics, because your character’s background may help to inform what he or she looks like.

, Choose what kind of pony you’d like to create based on the different varieties that have appeared on the TV show and in the toy lines. Pick a type of pony based on the physical characteristics and abilities associated with each type, or just because you like the look.


On the TV show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, the common types of ponies are earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi (as well as alicorns, which are a combination of unicorn and pegasus).
In the collection of toys made by Hasbro, there have been many different types of ponies, including flutter ponies, seaponies, breezies, and crystal ponies.Note that while most people choose a pony as their original character, you can also use another animal that is not a pony for your OC. In the TV show, creatures like zebras, griffons, and changelings also appear as characters from time to time., Decide on how you want your pony to look, including what colors to use for its body, mane and tail, and eyes. You can also make choices about the size and shape of your pony and its features.


Think about the shape of your pony’s head and ears, the style of its mane and tail, how long its legs are, and other features that will help make your original character truly unique.
Draw a quick sketch of your pony to help figure out what you want it to look like. Use colored pencils or markers to help you choose the colors you like best.

, Determine a Cutie Mark for your pony, which is the characteristic mark on the flank of all ponies who have discovered their special talent. You can make your Cutie Mark into anything you like based on your own talents or interests, or one you come up with for your character.


A Cutie Mark can represent anything you like to do or are good at. Maybe you’d use a cupcake as a Cutie Mark if you love to bake, or leaves and flowers if you’re a great gardener. A Cutie Mark can also be a more abstract design if you want to represent a more abstract quality, like being a good friend or having magical powers.
Try taking a quiz to determine your Cutie Mark.Or design your own and save it to your computer or print it for later use."

Keep an open mind.,
Recognize that the Brony community is not limited to just adult men.,
Start watching My Little Pony.,
Listen to the music.,
Watch some documentaries about Bronies.,
Acquaint yourself with the Brony lingoo.,
Take a look at both sides of the argument of Bronies.,
Know that there is indeed a dark side of the fandom.,
Get into the fandom itself.,
Respect headcanons and pairings.,
Listen to the fan music.,
Check out fan art.,
Go to a convention.,
Read a couple of fanfictions.,
Watch some fan videos.,
Be polite and understanding.",How to Explore Brony Culture," Most people are used to ""girl things"" and ""boy things"" being segregated, and thus may recoil to see guys enjoying a ""girl thing."" Ask yourself what is so wrong with boys and men enjoying a more traditionally feminine show. ""Girls' shows"" are not inherently less good than ""boys' shows,"" and guys who like girlier things are not automatically deserving of ridicule or disgust.


Try reading feminist literature to help you gain a more critical perspective about the gender binary.
Girls watch shows aimed at boys all the time. Many argue that boys should be able to enjoy the same freedom.;
, There are both male and female viewers of all ages who appreciate the show. The term ""Brony"" is simply a commonly used reference to adult men who watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. This is an understandable misconception, seeing as how many people not familiar with the Brony fandom tend to see this as unusual. However, Bronies are made up of boys, girls, men, and women.


Some female fans prefer to be called ""Pegasisters."" This varies between individuals.

My Little Pony appeals to people of all ages, backgrounds, and genders. The community is very diverse, and you won't have to look hard to make new friends!

, You do not necessarily have to watch the whole show if you don't feel like it. At least try out more than episode one before forming an opinion. Episodes recommended for newcomers to the show would be the 2-parter pilot episodes of season 1, the season 2 finale, the season 4 finale, or the season 5 premiere, as these feature the height of plot, humor, demonstration of character, and action (though most obviously come with major spoilers).


If you do not want to take the time to watch the episodes, try looking for reviews by MLP analysts, such as The AnY Pony, ILoveKimPossibleAlot, DrWolf001, Silver Quill, and more.

, My Little Pony is surprisingly famous for its music, written by Daniel Ingram. Look for My Little Pony songs on websites such as YouTube. Some of the most recommended songs include Winter Wrap-Up and At The Gala.

, Yes, there are documentaries about the Brony fandom. Try out A Brony Tale, The Brony Chronicles (exclusive to Saberspark's YouTube channel), or Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony.


These tend to focus on the adult male fans, perhaps because society considers them the most unusual.

, When Bronies talk amongst each other, oftentimes you will hear words such as ""somepony"", ""anypony"", ""Celestia's sake"", or the infamous ""brohoof"".

, It has been a subject of debate for some time, and to get a proper perspective on it, you need to listen to both the good and the bad about it. This means watching those for it, such as NateTalksToYou, those with neutral stances, such as Rhett and Link, and those who attack it, such as the criticisms found in mainstream media.

, Before you get grossed out at the Brony community, you need to understand one thing: Rule 34 of the Internet applies to absolutely everything. It doesn't start and end with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.


The community has been criticized for misogyny, ableism (particularly regarding a disabled grey pony), and rape jokes. Keep a critical eye, apologize if you accidentally hurt someone, and encourage fellow fans to be considerate.
It is possible to enjoy a fandom while still being critical of certain sects and ideas within the fandom.
Encourage other Bronies to tag explicit material appropriately so that younger fans don't stumble upon it.

, Converse with Bronies. Discuss things about the show, why they like it, why it has such a big impact, etc. The best way to understand a group of people is to talk to them.


Remember to read forum rules before posting! This is a good way to avoid getting a bad reputation in the community.

, Some Bronies will make up their own ""facts"" about the show, such as, ""I imagine that Spike sings love songs to Rarity outside her bedroom window."" It's best to either join in or leave it be, because it's just a way to have fun. It can be irritating if you don't agree that Big Mac and Fluttershy are perfect for each other, or you can't stand fanfic about Discord and Celestia, but remember: they're just having fun, and you can let it be.


If a headcanon or couple annoys you, it's best to just leave it alone. Behave the same way you'd want others to behave towards your headcanons and favorite couples.
Sometimes disability/LGBTQIA headcanons are really important to the maker (e.g. ""I bet Twilight Sparkle is autistic, just like me!""). It can help them feel better about being different. Never tear someone down for trying to feel good about themselves.
If you believe a headcanon, fanfic, or other thing is actively harmful (e.g. rape jokes), then it is absolutely okay to voice concern.

, Brony composers and producers themselves make amazing music and remixes dedicated to the show. There are hundreds of Brony musicians, but for starters, check out popular composers such as BlackGryph0n, PON3, The Living Tombstone, Aviators, Prince Whateverer, etc.

, Bronies are known for making spectacular artwork. There are all kinds, whether it be cute little chibis, realistic interpretations, or various adaptations of the characters.


Many Brony artists enjoy imagining what the ponies would look like as humans.

, This may be a bit of a stretch, but going to a My Little Pony con can greatly expand your knowledge of the Brony community. If you cannot afford it, or simply do not want to, this step is optional.

, If you're not much of a reader, or you just don't like fanfiction in general, then you can skip this step. However, you may be surprised at the enginuity and creativity found in fanfictions. Try starting out with popular hits, such as Fallout Equestria, The Rainbow Factory, or My Little Dashie.

You can search through specific categories on Fimfiction.net.

, As you may or may not have noticed, the community is full of people with broad and expansive talents. Fan videos (particularly animations) are extremely popular with Bronies. If you don't have a clue what to watch, there is a top 10 pony videos list released by LittleshyFiM every month on YouTube (this series has previously been run on different channels by other content creators including Saber Spark and JHaller).

, Brony culture is made up of people of different walks of life—gay black men, giggly teen girls, bearded starving artists, shy disabled women, and all sorts of people around the world. None of these people are inherently better or worse than others. Respect others' differences, use inclusive language, and don't be afraid to make new friends.

Start with basic shapes.,
Add distinguishing details.,
Add color to your pony.",How to Create a My Little Pony Original Character2," Sketch out the basic shapes that make up a pony’s body before you add more detail to the features. Use a pencil that will draw lightly, a good eraser, and any type of drawing or printer paper.


Start with three circles: one larger one for the head, and two slightly smaller ones for the body.
Add a rounded triangle shape for the ear and whatever shape you’d like for the mouth and nose.
Add six curved lines coming out from the circles for the body to create the legs.
Connect the shapes with smooth curved lines for the neck, body, and feet. Then erase all of the lines from your initial sketched shapes that you don’t need anymore., Sketch in the details of your face, any fur on its feet, style of the mane and tail, and any other special features that your pony has. Don’t forget the Cutie Mark on its flank, right in front of the tail!


Draw in a big eye in the shape of a D, a curve for a smiling mouth, and a tiny line for a nostril to complete the face.Pick a hairstyle for the mane and tail of your pony. Is it long and flowing? Curly? Multi-colored?
Draw in a unicorn horn on the forehead if you’ve decided your pony will be a unicorn, or pegasus wings on its back if it is a pegasus.

, Once you’ve got the outline for your pony’s body and details, color it in with colored pencils, markers, or crayons. You can even add other embellishments like glitter or small gems to add extra flair to the body and hair of your original character.


You can use your favorite colors, or any colors that make sense for the backstory of your pony. For instance, if your character loves the ocean and swimming, maybe you will use blue and green colors reminiscent of the sea.
Don’t be afraid to use more than one color, especially for the hair. The character Rainbow Dash actually has a whole rainbow of colors in her mane and tail.
Don’t forget to color the iris of your pony’s eye!

These will allow you to save or print the design and add your own customization with color.


Try printing out a pony template and color it in with your own colored pencils, markers, crayons, or paint. Or save a template to your computer and use a photo editing program to fill it with color.
Note that a template won’t allow for too much customization of things like face and body shape or hairstyle, unless you draw in your own extra details by hand.

Follow trends you enjoy.,
Consider the 90+ missing episodes.,
Don't watch all of the episodes of a story in one sitting.",How to Watch Classic Doctor Who3," Doctor Who was very different from 1963 to 1989 than it is today. New series fans have scrutinized it for its bad visuals and special effects, weird planets, and low production values. Take all this into account when you're deciding. Also remember that classic Who also ran in a serialized format, with stories ranging anywhere from 1 to 12 episodes to complete one story arc.

, There were eight classic Doctors so you have some options. Here is a list of good starting points and the year in which they were broadcast:


An Unearthly Child (1963)

There are several fan websites that track characters and monsters and present a full list of episodes they appear in., In the late 1960s and the 1970s the BBC wanted to reuse videotape so they wouldn't have to keep buying more, and as a result, multiple episodes from the first three Doctors' eras were ""lost to time."" Thankfully though, all of the Third Doctor's era has been recovered and missing episodes are starting to turn up in unexpected places. So there is hope yet., Let the cliffhanger hang and leave it there.

In many cases, however, you'll have to choose your own audition piece.Monologues are common requirements for individual auditions.Find books of monologues at your local library or online.
Perform your favorite monologues to friends, family, and strangers. Ask for feedback. Friends and family may be overly kind to you, so it's a good idea to perform in front of people you don't know, too.

, When you audition, especially for serious parts, a headshot is often required. This is generally an 8x10, high-quality print where your face is clearly visible. Your name should be on the print, in most cases in the lower right hand corner. To this print, you'll need to staple an acting resume, which includes things like:


Your basic stats (hair and eye color, height, weight, age, etc.)
Acting training and experience
Special skills and abilities the director might find desirable, Community centers and colleges frequently offer acting classes. Take an improvisation (improv) class or stand-up comedy class to work on your stage presence, delivery, and onstage flexibility.


Beyond simply giving you more experience, you'll also receive professional level critique and advice from the instructor of the class.
If you're nervous about taking a class by yourself, invite a friend to join you. Many basic acting/improv classes have open enrollment.

, Keep an eye on local theatres. These will post casting calls when planning for a new performance. Join acting related social media groups, like those on Facebook or Twitter, to network with fellow actors and hear about potential gigs.


When choosing a performance to audition for, keep your personal style in mind. You may be a versatile actor, but oftentimes people are strong-suited for certain roles, like comedic or dramatic ones., Drop off your headshot. Talk to staff and let them know you're interested in getting involved. Getting your foot in the door can help you network and land a future part.


Even if you aren't cast in a performance, ask if you can work as a stage hand or backstage. This will expose you to active talent, directors, and producers.

, All of your audition choices should prove that you're the right person to play this part. Sometimes, you may be asked to list two or three parts you're interested in. Your main part should be the focus, but have some backups on hand, just in case.In some cases, a director may love your ability, but think you're the wrong choice for the part you've selected. By having backups, you'll show that you're really interested in being a part of the performance and not just a single part.

, What kind of performance are you auditioning for? If it's dramatic, you'll want to showcase your dramatic acting skills. What time period and environment does the performance take place in? This might influence how you act, speak, and treat others onstage.Some plays, like My Fair Lady, are set in a location that requires an accent. In the case of My Fair Lady, which takes place in London, you'd want to show off your British accent.
Watch famous, popular, or iconic recordings of the performance for which you're auditioning. These can help you identify features you'll want to demonstrate in your audition.

, The tone of your audition piece should suit the part you're auditioning for. Try to match your audition piece with the local color of the part you're trying out for. Local color includes things like time period, region, and manner of speech.Analyze the performances of other actors who played the part you'll be trying out for. Include your favorite features of their performance in your own.

, Make big choices with your audition. There may be many people trying out for the same part, and standing out from the crowd will improve your chances of being remembered. Try not to be over-the-top silly, but aim to leave a mark on those watching your audition.Come to the audition dressed in period clothing for the audition piece you'll be doing. Be confident. If you're the only person dressed up, that might work to your advantage.
Choose a pivotal moment in your audition piece. Craft that moment so it has a large impact on those watching. Usually this involves (believably) accentuating a moment of high energy, like a punchline or dramatic climax.

, Look into your character's backstory. If it doesn't have one, research similar jobs to that of your character to get a feel for the kind of person your character might be. For example, if you're playing the part of Bert from Mary Poppins, you might look into the life of a chimney sweep.Use the information you learn about your character to add depth to the part. This might be reflected in your gestures, delivery of lines, and more.
Think about how a character's life choices or job affect things like their posture or mannerisms. A military part, for example, would likely have good posture.

, Pay careful attention to the words your part exchanges with other characters. These will reveal the inner thoughts and feelings of your part. From these observations, draw conclusions about how your character feels about the world and other people in general.For example, in My Fair Lady, the character of Pickering is described as ""a confirmed bachelor."" You might interpret this to mean the character isn't interested in women.
In Fiddler on the Roof, the main character, Tevye, sings ""If I Were a Rich Man."" When playing this part, you might act somewhat self-consciously around successful characters., Lose yourself in the character you are playing. Train yourself to think thoughts natural to your character. When in-character, your personal thoughts will likely detract from your performance. As a general rule, if you believe you are the character, so will your audience.A good technique for losing yourself in your character involves imagining yourself and your personal experiences burning up in a flame, leaving only your character behind.

, An actor's body and voice are their instrument. Performing on stage requires energy, speed, and stamina. Exercise so you're up to the challenge of performing. Avoid smoking to protect your voice.Avoid drinking alcohol before performing. Alcohol dehydrates you, which can strain your voice before performing.
Get plenty of sleep before performances so you feel refreshed and at full energy when you go on stage.
It's common to be affected by nerves before a performance. Take melatonin, which is available at most drug and convenience stores, to aid in getting a good night's sleep.

This self-study is informal but still an absolutely crucial step since it will prepare you for the path that lies before you.


Film producers are involved in nearly every aspect of a film's creation. As a film producer, you will be responsible for:

Finding a script, story, or idea for the movie. You might delegate some of the work to a separate screenwriter, but the initial task of finding a story to work with rests on your shoulders.
Finding funding for the production budget. If the project is small enough or you are wealthy enough, you might finance a project yourself, but many producers do need to secure some form of outside funding.
Hiring a creative team to make the movie. A head producer will need to hire lower-level producers and may even hire the director. These people will usually hire those who are less involved in the production side of things, including actors.
Handling schedules and expenses. You need to keep the project moving and also figure out what aspects of production to cut if your funds are running low.
Securing distribution. If you work through a major studio, much of this will already be taken care of. If not, though, you will need to find independent distribution companies.
Marketing the film. You will have help from your studio and distributor, but many of the final decisions will be your responsibility.


Also note that there are different types of producer positions, and each takes care of different aspects of the production process.

The head producer gets the final say in most decisions and maintains all financial, legal, and scheduling concerns.
An executive producer takes care of many financial concerns and may help secure the script or story for the film.
An associate producer essentially assists an executive producer in his or her tasks.
A line producer is a lower level position. He or she will usually take care of issues that come up during the shoot.
A co-producer is a line producer who is also involved in some of the creative production of the film.

;
, You can go to a film school or a liberal arts college that offers some form of film studies. Either way, you need to obtain a four-year Bachelor of Arts degree in production, film studies, or some other closely related field.


During your formal education, expect to take classes on cinema production, visual storytelling, editing, screenwriting, digital production, critical film studies, drawing, and film prep.If you attend a college with a good film program, you will also create short films for some of your classes. These films can and should be included in your portfolio.

, While not absolutely necessary, going onto graduate school and obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater or film production can prepare you even better for this career.


Master's degrees focus on both the creative and business sides of film production.

, Even after you complete your formal education, you should continue your informal education. Keep yourself up-to-date on the latest news and innovations concerning film production. You can learn on your own or by taking supplementary classes.


Check out colleges that offer film studies. Many may offer continuing education courses. While you will not earn another degree for completing them, you will usually receive some sort of certificate for doing so.

, Start gaining related experience as early as possible. If you are still a junior high student, high school student, or a high school graduate with no college education, you should look for ways to get involved with film and theater at school or in the community. Even experience not directly related to producing can be helpful.


Many film producers start as writers or actors, so even if you cannot get early experience in directly producing a film, try to get experience in one of these fields. Experience along these lines can help you get your foot in the door.
If there are no opportunities immediately available to you in regards to film, look for opportunities related to theater. Act in a high school play or write a script for a community theater. While not directly related to producing or film, even this sort of experience can give you a decent starting point.
If you are still in high school, also consider taking classes in drama, theater, dramatic literature, film, and business.

, During your college years or shortly after, you should give serious consideration to the idea of completing a formal internship. For this aspect of your experience, you should look for a position that will specifically give you production staff experience.


Chances are, you will not be able to secure an internship at a major studio while still in college. You can, however, find production internships at small studios, local television networks, and local radio stations.
Note that most internships are ""unpaid,"" but you will at least receive college credit for completing them. The experience itself can be invaluable, and an internship looks good on your resume. If you do well enough, you might also be able to get some helpful networking in for the future.
If you cannot find an internship through an actual studio, start heading to the drama departments of nearby colleges and high schools. Any related experience is better than none.

, While you are still in your student years, begin to make your own short films and videos. These initial projects do not need to be anything extensive—a few minutes per project should be sufficient. The idea here is to give yourself a taste of what being a producer is like on a small scale while also gradually building your portfolio.


The initial short videos you produce can be distributed via the Internet.Any video that is 10 minutes or less can be uploaded fairly easily, and nowadays, some Internet videos can even go viral if the right audience catches onto them. Even if your work receives minimal exposure, though, you can gain a little experience in the shooting side of production as well as the distribution side.

, Aside from experience within the fields of drama and film, there are other life skills that are more basic and more versatile you should be looking to build upon.


Some of the additional skills you will need to master include communication skills, leadership skills, management ability, and creativity.
Consider taking business courses while in college. A second major or even a business minor can be extremely helpful. Business courses dealing with finance, marketing, and management will offer you the most benefit.
Leadership skills are necessary since you need to instruct the people on your crew. Communication skills are required if you want to provide these instructions and coordinate work effectively. Management skills are similarly necessary since you need to figure out how to keep things running smoothly.
While you may have your mind set on the business aspect of production, you also need to figure out the best ways to find appealing stories and interpret scripts, so creativity is a necessity.

, The market is always changing, but there are a few aspects you can count on to be fairly similar as the years progress. Once you get out of school and are ready to go out into the work force, do a little research on your job outlook, expected salary, and other aspects of your anticipated career.Overall, employment opportunities are expected to grow 3 percent from 2012 to 2022. This is slower than most other occupations.
You will likely face a great deal of competition within the field.
As of May 2012, the median annual wages for producers within the broader field were as follows:

Motion picture and video—$94,110
Cable and other subscription programming—$83,220
Television broadcasting—$56,950
Performing arts companies—$49,690
Radio broadcasting—$48,110



, Everyone has to start somewhere. Most entry-level positions related to film production will not pay much, nor will they come with much power or control. Nonetheless, these positions are essential steps you need to cross over while climbing the job ladder.


Note that at the entry-level, you can expect to find work as a production assistant or story editor. While your power and responsibilities will be limited, you can at least gain helpful prospective and experience.
Look for work with movie or television studios. You may find it easier to secure a job with a small studio instead of a larger one.
Assistant directors and other entry-level positions usually do not earn much money, especially in the non-profit sector, so you should prepare to live on a tight budget for a year or so.
Your chances of finding work might improve if you live in an area with more opportunities available, like Los Angeles. Of course, many others will have the same idea, so your competition will also be fiercer in those areas of the country.

, Meanwhile, you should begin focusing your energy on securing funds and resources for a longer film project of your own. It does not need to be a feature-length project, but it should at least be longer and more involved than the projects you worked on during your college years.


When working on a big project of your own, you could write your own script or hire a writer to do so for you. Alternatively, you can purchase literary work already made from the author.
Also consider doing work for hire or contract work. For instance, schools might be willing to make a contract with you to produce educational films.While this may not seem glamorous, the experience can be very helpful.
Consider submitting your own projects to student or small independent film festivals. These contests and events might be small, but those deeply involved in the industry do pay attention to them, so making a mark here could help you impress the right people.

, As you you gain experience with your own projects and experience in the industry, your portfolio will grow and more people will begin to notice your talent. You will be able to get higher-paid positions that allow you to have more control over the production process. It may take time, but with enough patience, energy, and skill, you can eventually work your way up to the top.


You will usually need several years of experience before you start working your way up.
Remember, this is quite a difficult profession to get into, it would be better if you first of all looked at becoming a writer or a screenwriter etc; if all goes well maybe a step up is needed. Look at Producers Assistant. Once you've gained experience, you'll be ready!

"
Don't take criticism personally.,
Calm down instead of talking back.,
Show interest in the director's vision.,
Suggest improvements tactfully.,
Cooperate.,
Consider your options in extreme situations.",How to Survive a Strict Director," Directors often get stressed, especially in the final weeks of rehearsal or filming. They may give harsh criticism or overreact to late arrivals and minor mistakes. Try not to let this upset you.;
, Talking back to the director will just make the work more unpleasant, and (if you're a professional) may hurt your chances at future productions. Try to find a strategy to calm down: count to ten, take deep breaths, or tense and relax your fists.

, Make an effort to understand what the director is going for. Pay attention to her instructions, practice your performance, and demonstrate that you're invested in a high quality result. Staying on the director's good side should help you avoid unpleasant situations.

, A good director listens to the actors' input, but that doesn't mean you can give it anytime, or that he's obligated to agree. Choose a moment when he doesn't look busy, ideally after rehearsal is finished. Phrase your suggestion as a question, such as ""do you think it would work better if...""?

, At the end of the day, the director gets to make the decisions. The strict directors have often put a lot of thought into the production. Follow their instructions and learn how to work within their specifications.

, If the director is behaving unprofessionally and truly making you miserable, take some time to consider what to do. If you are working professionally, it may be worth seeing this production through for the sake of your resume or networking. Your older contacts or acting coaches can help you decide whether it's worth sticking with the performance.

Make sure that you've definitely been bitten by the ""acting bug"": you know that's what you want to do with your life regardless of criticisms you may or may not receive from family and peers.,
Know your source(s) of income.,
Research actor training programs with the intention of enrolling in one, whether it'd be a couple of classes here or there or a 2-3 year conservatory program.,
To help get you started some of the best conservatories are Circle in the Square, Stella Adler, The New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts, and William Esper to name a few.

,
It's also a good idea, if you can, to try to have some idea of what you expect out of an acting school or teacher.,
Research good monologues that are right for you.,
It is helpful to have a binder filled with at least ten different monologues from different plays, with different types of characters.,
If you are doing musical theatre you should have a binder filled with songs.

,
In NYC places like Drama Book Shop or Samuel French (also in LA) are great places to go look for monologues as their staffs are largely comprised of theatre buffs and actors themselves, who often are more than glad to lend you a helping hand.

,
Make friends with peers that you meet at classes and auditions.,
Research good photographers in the area so that you can get good headshots.,
Schedule meetings to have a short one on one chat with them just to get a sense of what their persona is like.,
Think about whether studio light or natural light speaks to you more and express that to your photographer.,
Once you feel comfortable in your own skin, start auditioning for projects!,
Understand the general audition process.,
Work towards getting an agent/representation.,
Another increasingly popular method of getting your foot in the door is going to specialized studios that provide agent/casting director workshops/seminars.,
One way of looking at these kind of institutions is, if a person is not getting auditions, not being sent out by her agent or maybe doesn't even have an agent and doesn't have many industry contacts or know how to get them, then why not, yes pay a little money and be sure to be able to see the people you want to meet?

",How to Become a Working Actor,";
, Whether you have wealthy parents or have to earn a living, you will accumulate many expenses during at least the beginning part of your career. Get your finances together at the start of your career, so that you won't have to worry about it later.

, Remember, a prestigious institution is only as good as the instructors in them. It would be helpful to know whether the instructors are or have been working actors in the past. If you plan on enrolling in a 2-3 year program, understand that for the most part, that's the time you'd be sacrificing to improve your craft and chances are, you won't be able to audition for work outside the institution. Auditing classes here and there is a good way to get your feet wet. Vary your curriculum by researching good places to take Shakespeare, scene study, improv, movement, voice/speech etc.

,, Having more clarity about that can help you during the interview during which you are considering attending a school and during which the school is evaluating you for admission.

, A monologue is defined as ""a long speech spoken by an actor in a play or movie."" In NYC at least, it is extremely helpful to have a couple of these under your belt for when you audition (mostly for theatre and agent/CD workshops, TV/film auditions USUALLY call for cold/prepared reading skills). Worry more about the context of the monologue instead of the actual breakdown of the character. For example if the character speaking the monologue is meant to be a woman, but you feel from the text that that doesn't necessarily have to be so, go for it. You can always omit certain parts.

, If the person you are auditioning for asks if you have another piece you can take out your binder and name a few pieces (just ask if they would prefer, dark comedy, comedic, dramatic, etc.). Also having some pieces from Shakespeare's plays is a must.

,,, You never know how those connections can help you out in the future if you're in the company of the right people. If nothing else, it's great to have a support group. When choosing your friends, ask yourself if not only are they fun to be around, but also if they add value to your mission to becoming a working actor. There are a lot of negative people in the world who will drag you down if you let them. Stay focused on what you want. One way to do that is to surround yourself by people who will help you stay focused on what you want.

, If you have a trustworthy friend who is into headshot photography, that is great too. Make a list of a few whose work catches your eye.

, It is important to have a photographer you feel comfortable with. Remember, you are choosing the headshot photographer, the photographer isn't choosing you, so make sure you ask the right questions during your initial meeting. The more relaxed and assured during your shoot, the better your photos will turn out. Good photographers range from $300 to as much as $800 for a session.

, Make sure the photos look like you, and not a glammed up version of you. Color headshots, in general, are more popular now than black and white. Be careful of cheesy gestures like the hand or the fist on your chin. Costuming during a session is not recommended either. For example, if you want to show that you can play a doctor, don't get dressed up in a doctor's outfit and get that headshot reproduced, unless of course you're going out of your way to show how much of an amateur you are. Anyway, after the session is done and you take a look at all your available options with your photographer get one to maybe three of the photos you like touched up a bit and reproduced.

, Early on in your career, this will mostly consist of school/college plays, non-union theatre, community theatre, student films, shorts, low budget indie films. Those are all great things to get experience in if you don't happen to be bombarded by calls from the Law and Orders and Heroes ... which you probably won't be just yet. The two trade newspapers for these kinds of casting notices are Show Business Weekly (showbusinessweekly.com) and Backstage (backstage.com) but you can find other audition notices through nycastings.com, mandy.com, actorsaccess.com, as well as Craigslist from time to time. 85-90% of the jobs listed are unpaid, but hey ... in the beginning you have to gain experience and do what you love, right? Understand that auditioning for a project is a somewhat different beast than the things you learned about in scene study class. Over time, you will feel much more comfortable in the process. Outline your strengths and weaknesses. If you feel more comfortable reading cold for an audition than presenting a monologue, there is a reason for that. Practice your monologues more on your own time.

, Once you submit yourself for a particular project that you happen to be right for, whoever is in charge of casting that project may or may not call you in for an audition. If not, do not be discouraged as it is not an indication of how talented you are. If he/she does call you in, congrats! They will either call you on your service/cell line (never provide a home telephone number on your resume), or email you. Usually, they will also let you know when to come in to audition by providing a specific time slot or letting you come anytime within certain hours of days that they are holding auditions. Be sure to know certain things in advance, such as when the project shoots, rehearses, opens in a theatre etc. Also, make sure you know what they expect from you during the audition, such as preparing a contemporary comedic monologue, or preparing sides that they may have emailed you. ALWAYS bring a few headshot/resumes to the audition, even if you submitted to them electronically. It's a good habit to get into for when you audition for ""legit"" projects.

, The reason I say ""work towards"" is because chances are, finding legit representation will not happen overnight (generally, it's easier to have a commercial agent contact you, particularly if you're an ethnic actor). Real talent agencies can be found in a publication called ""The Ross Reports"" or ""The Agencies"". The following provides mixed results: mass mail headshots/resumes with cover letters to agencies. Since the increase in postage (now 97 cents to send a submission via First Class), mass mailing headshots can be an expensive affair. The cons of submitting unsolicited material to agencies is that you don't necessarily have the peace of mind knowing whether your mail has been opened at all. You have to remember that legit talent agents receive roughly 100 or more headshots a day! Make sure that your mailings are targeted and that you follow up. Casting directors and agents might not be interested in you right away, that's why you need to follow up every so often with news about how your career is progressing, recent work you booked, etc. Then one day out of the blue, you just might get a call. Just like with anything else, there are many different approaches. You have to find the one that works for you. .

, Some of them are TVI Studios, One on One NYC, Actors Connection, Breakthrough Studios and The Network NYC. Los Angeles have their own companies as well, such as ActNow. These are basically glorified ""paid auditions"", and you must remember that for the most part, that's exactly what they are. Go in there with the mindset that you're not necessarily attending those to learn more about your craft, but to get seen and hopefully get called in in the future. Of course, it is not a guarantee of employment and most people who criticize these studios don't even realize that perhaps they're not in the right stage to be auditioning for agents and CDs, or they're simply just ""not good enough"" yet. The downsides of this method is that on a per ""class"" basis, it's much more expensive than to just mail a headshot to that particular agent holding the workshop (97 cent mailing vs. $30-$40 workshop). However, the pros are that you have the peace of mind and guarantee that you met the person as opposed to worrying about whether your mailing was tossed in the trash. Also, it's easier to make an impression in person when they can see your acting style, type, age range. Most of these workshops also allocate a few more minutes to each actor so you can discuss ""what you've been doing lately"" on top of you actually auditioning for them. Most importantly, it's excellent practice for when you actually are called in by an industry professional to interview/audition ... provided you can afford these workshops.

Do the kiss as rehearsed.",How to Stage Kiss," Before you prepare for a stage kiss, it’s important to understand what’s happening in the scenes leading up to it, as well as what occurs afterward. That can help you decide the best way to play the kiss. Read the entire play closely, so you’re sure that you understand your character’s emotions and motivation for the kissing scene.Make sure to consider the relationship between your character and your co-star’s character. For example, if the stage kiss is between two new lovers, it will likely be tentative and gentle. On the other hand, if the kiss takes place between two people who are reunited after a long separation, it may be more passionate.
Take your character’s personality into account too. For example, if you’re playing someone who tends to keep their emotions bottled up, the kiss may be their breaking point when it all comes to the surface.;
, Whether you’re acting in a school play or a Broadway show, it’s the director’s job to ensure that all of the actors know exactly how to play their characters and the specific scenes. Your director will probably have a specific idea of how the kiss should be played, so they can provide suggestions to help you and your co-star know what to do. If the director doesn’t mention the kissing scene specifically, don’t be afraid to ask for some guidance.Because your director has probably overseen kissing scenes before, they probably have some good advice about how to make the experience less awkward. Let the director know if you're feeling embarrassed, so they can give you some pointers to feel more comfortable.
If your director wants to play the kissing scene in a way that’s different from what you imagined, have an open mind. Try it their way, and if it doesn’t feel natural or right to you, ask if you can try it your way to see if it works better.

, Having to kiss a co-star who you don’t know very well can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. However, it’s important to remember that while you may not have feelings for your co-star, your character does feel a connection to the character that your co-star is playing. You and your co-star don’t have to be attracted to one another or even like each other -- you just have to make the audience believe that your characters do.Try to treat the kissing as you would any action in a scene that you wouldn't do in real life, such as yelling at another character or being violent. It's all just pretend.
Playing a kissing scene can be especially awkward if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend. It’s best to have a honest discussion with your significant other about it rather than avoiding the topic. That way, you can address their concerns and reassure them that you’re only playing a role.

, For most people, having to do a kissing scene with someone who they don’t know very well feels awkward. The best way to alleviate your discomfort is to get to know your co-star a little better. If you’re able to become more comfortable with one another, it may be easier to play the kissing scene without feeling much embarrassment.You don't have to spend a lot of time with your co-star to get to know them. Consider going out for some coffee or just sit down and chat with them during rehearsal breaks

, While it helps if you have a certain comfort level with your co-star, it’s just as important that you both grasp what’s happening in the kissing scene. Have a discussion about the motivation for each character so you both understand what the kiss means to them and can figure out the best way to approach it.Keep in mind that the kiss might not mean the same thing to both characters. For example, one character might have genuine feelings, while the other is only trying to manipulate their love interest to get something they want. Even if that’s the case, you and your co-star should agree on what the overall tone of the kiss should be, such as tender, passionate, or gentle.

, In order for you and your co-star to feel less awkward during the kiss, it helps to establish clear boundaries about what you're both comfortable with. You might both agree to kiss for real during the scene, but decide that it's best to do it with your mouths completely closed. On the other hand, if you're both feeling embarrassed, you might agree that it's better to do a fake kiss so your lips don't actually touch. Take the time to discuss how close you're willing to get, so you neither of you accidentally makes the other uncomfortable. No matter what your director or co-star thinks, you should never do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. It’s normal to feel nervous and awkward, so you shouldn’t be afraid to speak up.
If you're not sure how to talk to your co-star about your boundaries, you might say something like, ""Because we don't know each other well, I'm only comfortable with a close-mouthed kiss. Is that okay with you?""

, The most important step in feeling comfortable about a kissing scene is working out the specific movements that will make up the moment. Once you and your co-star have established boundaries for the scene, it's usually easier to plan the kiss. Try to focus on the technical details to keep it from becoming awkward. That means discussing whether you'll be standing or sitting for the kiss and which direction you'll each move your head.The tone of the kiss can help you choreograph it. For example, if it's a tentative first kiss, you'll probably move slowly and it won't last very long. On the other hand, if it's a passionate kiss, you will probably move quickly to convey urgency, and it will last a little longer.
Don’t just focus on the kiss itself. Consider where you’re going to place your hands during the scene, such as on your co-star's cheek, and whether you’re going to embrace as you kiss.

, For many stage kisses, you don’t actually have to touch lips with your co-star to make the audience believe you're kissing. One of you can tenderly place your hand on the side of the other’s neck, so the fingers are behind the ear and the thumb can rest against the co-star’s lips. When you or your co-star leans in for the kiss, you kiss the thumb rather than the lips. It's an ideal option if you're uncomfortable with the idea of kissing your co-star..


If you’re planning to use the fake stage kiss method, ask an experienced actor to show you how to do it. It can be tricky if you’ve never seen it used before
For the fake stage kissing technique, make sure that it’s the thumb on the hand that’s furthest away from the audience that rests against the lips. That way, it will be harder for the audience to pick up that it’s not a real kiss.
In some cases, it may not be possible to do a fake stage kiss. Talk to your director to discuss what works best for the scene.

, If the first time you kiss -- or even fake kiss -- your co-star is on the stage, you’re probably going to be especially anxious. To alleviate some of the nerves, make sure to rehearse the kiss with your co-star as many times as necessary to ensure that you both know exactly how to stage it and you're more comfortable with the idea.


While you and your co-star may want to rehearse alone the first couple of times, you should practice in front of the other cast and crew a few times so you get used to performing the scene in front of an audience.
Practice the kiss when you’re in costume at least once or twice. That way, if you or your co-star are wearing a hat or some other piece of clothing that might make the kiss awkward, you’ll know ahead of time.
The director may have some notes about the kiss after they see you rehearse it. Incorporate that feedback into your performance as long as you’re comfortable with it.

, A kissing scene is more pleasant for everyone involved when both actors are courteous enough to practice proper hygiene. Make show that you’ve showered the day of the performance, and use deodorant before going on stage. Most importantly, though,no one wants to kiss someone who has bad breath, so brush your teeth before the scene too.If your kiss is at the end of the play and you’re worried about your breath not being very fresh by then, it’s a good idea to bring some breath mints, gum, breath spray, or mouthwash with you. During the intermission or a scene that you’re not in, you can quickly freshen your breath for the kiss.
If you’re planning to kiss for real, you may also want to apply some lip balm to ensure that your lips are smooth.

, It may seem obvious, but you want to be certain that you know all of your lines leading up to and following the kiss. If you focus exclusively on the kiss itself and how nervous you are about getting it right, you run the risk of forgetting your lines during the performance and ruining the scene. Go over the lines in the kissing scene a little more carefully than the other scenes in the play to ensure that you have them down cold.One trick to help you learn the lines in your kissing scene is to practice them while you’re doing something else, such as knitting or tossing a ball. That can help simulate the distraction that you may feel while you’re on stage and thinking about the upcoming kiss.

, If you want to get the kiss right when you’re on the stage, you should perform it exactly as you and your co-star have practiced. Changing the way you play it in the last minute because you’re uncomfortable or feeling awkward usually only makes things worse because your co-star doesn't know what's coming. Perform the kiss exactly as you two rehearsed, so you both know what to do and how to react.If you’re feeling uncomfortable with anything regarding the kiss, speak up during rehearsals. You want to be confident about the way that you’re playing it by the time of the performance.
If there is something about the kiss that needs to be changed at the last minute, such as you wanting to forgo a real kiss for a fake stage kiss because you’re sick, make sure to tell your co-star before you go on stage.

Study acting.,
Read books on acting.,
Read plays.,
Take notes on the greats.",How to Strengthen Your Acting Skills1," Like any skill or talent, improving your acting ability is a muscle that needs to be exercised if you want it to grow. Learning how to act from professionals in classes and workshops is one the most important and effective ways to improve.


You can find acting and improv classes in your city or at your college or university. Take classes that interest you and which will push you to improve.
A professional acting coach or teacher will be able to guide you in proper technique and give you tools that better you as an actor. You can’t always see what you’re doing. But a teacher can. And your teacher will be able to help you make adjustments, learn the basics, and teach you how to mentally approach your craft.
There are acting coaches and teachers who specialize in specific forms and can help you reach specific goals. If you want to learn to be better at auditioning on camera, you can find a teacher who will help you improve.
Put yourself in the right mindset to learn. Don’t think you are too good for classes. You’re not. For most actors, your job isn’t to be an actor. Your job is to learn and to audition.;
, In addition to getting on your feet and learning, reading and studying books on acting will help you improve your skills as an actor.


Treat acting like any subject in school. You have to do your homework and study. Because when it comes to acting, the test is an audition.
There are countless books for you to read on the subject of acting. Don’t just grab the first one you see. Ask your teachers and coaches for recommendations.
There are some books that have tremendous value like “Audition” by Michael Shurtleff. This book houses twelve guideposts that go way beyond just auditioning. The twelve guideposts in the book will show up in other books, in your technique, and in life. , Plays house a wealth of knowledge on acting. Plays will help you to understand how characters work and allow you to analyze the material. When you read plays pay attention to the stage directions, beats, and the dialogue. There is meaning in each part that can help you improve your skill.
Notice the heightened nature of characters. In plays, characters have a heightened sense of purpose and reality. Whether it’s Shakespeare or something modern. Each character has an ultimate objective, something to strive for. Every line, every action is a step toward reaching that goal.
Take notes on what you think these tactics and objectives are. Use what you’ve learned from class and books to break down the scenes and the characters. Practice the scenes and monologues out loud. Doing these activities will allow you to begin to understand how to portray characters from a page on stage or in front of a camera.

, Learn from your favorite actors. Watch interviews, read books on these actors, and study films the greats are in.


The actors that have made it can be another great resource for you. Pay attention to how these actors convey emotion, react to something or someone. Notice how truly talented actors seem can be completely immersed in a moment and live it as if it were real. Then go back to your work and think about how you can do the same.
""Inside the Actor’s Studio"" is a great source for watching interviews with actors. You can learn how these talented actors approached acting. The kinds of studying that took place. How an actor approaches a scene or character.
Don’t just try to imitate your favorite actors. But pay attention to what these people believe is valuable and useful. Then try to incorporate it into your own studies.

Write around five minutes of original material that you find funny, and that you believe others will find funny too.,
Find a comedy club where you can book in an open-spot.,
Rehearse.,
Make sure the audience can hear what you want them to hear when you're up on stage.,
Stick to your allotted time, this will really help you get more gigs.,
Keep a book with the dates of your gigs, your set list, and how each bit went.,
Re-write anything that you think can be made funnier.,
Ask for feedback from experienced acts.,
Be prepared for hecklers.",How to Start Doing Stand up Comedy," Some find it useful to go and watch other stand-ups, but remember that the more you see of how other people approach it, the harder it is to be original. Ask some friends about funny stories or jokes that they might have, then stretch it a little. Make it very interesting. Have you noticed that some comedians make fun of the scariest things that have happened to them? Well, you can too! There has to be at least a couple of scary moments that have occurred.;
, This may require some patience as some clubs have a long waiting list of acts. If no clubs in town are ready for you, look into schools, talent shows, anywhere that will have an audience. Always tell jokes to anybody even if they are somewhat strangers to you. For instance, let's say you run into this lady at the supermarket. You grab the same can of peaches or something. Say sorry and try to tell a joke that related to that situation, any joke that comes to mind. Just try to get a humorous vibe with everybody.. If that doesn't work just tell jokes about sex you never had, who knows? That might be a club owner who is looking for comedy acts. So, always keep a positive funny attitude with anybody.

, Learn your material inside-out. Practice saying it out loud. This may seem uncomfortable at first, but it will help to hear your set spoken out loud. Most comedians try to rehearse alone or with their manager or club owner. Try to stay away from asking your friends to watch you rehearse because then it spills the beans and gives out your comedy act. Practice makes perfect right? Well, perfect practice makes perfect so if you are practicing with little perseverance you might as well not practice at all.

, Listen to the MC and the other acts, and note how loud they are, and where they are holding the microphone. No matter how crazy the audience goes, never yell. That will totally get them out of the mood and maybe even hurt their ears!

, Many comics use vibrating watches so that they know when their time is up without the annoyance of an audible alarm going off.

, The cool thing about having a datebook is that if some club calls you and asks you to do a comedy act with them you can say, ""Oh, I'll have to check my datebook."" Then they will be like, ""Whoa they got a datebook, must be pretty successful."" See? Works every time, seriously.

, Be really critical. If a bit really doesn't work, re-write it or ditch it and write something that does. Repeat this process.

, If you asked for it don't ignore it but remember it is only an opinion. If what they suggest doesn’t feel right to you ask yourself why, and use your own common sense to see if their suggestions would work for you.

, By that I mean, be prepared to act like a total baby when someone doesn't like your joke. Some people will not find you funny, (because you aren't) the big stars avoid most audience critics due to ticket prices discourage the casual dissenter, however they still get soft-hecklers, those who want their minute of fame. You, the aspiring comic, will have to deal with both soft and die-hard hecklers. This may happen at any time but it is most likely after one of your punch-lines has failed to entertain. When you are heckled, you can do one of three things. The first is to ignore it and carry on, which is often the most sensible option for new comics, who have no way of knowing whether the audience is with them or not. The second and third are both to make a response. You may either merely make a dismissive response, or attempt to make a joke out of the heckle and/or heckler. Try to avoid personal insults, they don't go down well. The best responses are those that win you the moral victory. Keep retorts short and sweet. If you think of a good one later, keep in for the next time you hear a similar heckle, it is amazing how often the same heckle will occur.

Practice monologues.,
Audition for plays.,
Record yourself performing.,
Put up your own production.",How to Strengthen Your Acting Skills2," Monologues will help you get better at memorization, character study, and auditioning.


When searching for monologues you can search online but be weary of which monologues you find. Casting directors don’t want to see you perform the same monologue that four other people have performed. This happens when people simply find monologues online. Instead, find one that you like from one of the plays you’ve read.
Go over your monologue and scan it. Meaning you should break down the beats, and know your objective. This is where the twelve guideposts come in handy. Find the places in your monologue where you can hit each one. Know where you are, who you are talking to, who you are, what you need, etc.
If you truly want to improve your ability as an actor, you should have roughly four monologues. Have four that you practice frequently and have scanned and memorized. These are monologues that you could perform at any time with no preparation. You should have two that are humorous and two that are dramatic. One of each should be contemporary and the other classical.

, Classes and studying acting is a great way to dissect and build your skill. But auditioning for shows is also extremely valuable to improving.


When you audition you get to act in a way that will allow you to better understand where your skills lie. You'll see what you need to further work on. Auditions are important for not only getting your face and name out there; but for getting some practice in.
An audition usually consists of cold reading a scene, performing a monologue, or both. Auditions will help you to get better at making decisions in a scene quickly and in the moment. You won’t have a lot of time to scan your lines, but learning to operate well with that lack of time will help you grow.
Go to as many auditions as you can. You can do a search in your area for theatre or film auditions and sign up. Or, ask your teachers where the best place to find auditions is.
If an audition goes well and you get cast, then you know you are on a path that is helping you improve your skill. During your audition, treat it as if it’s opening night. You should use everything you have to fully immerse yourself in the character and make strong choices. If making strong choices is hard for you, auditioning will help you improve that skill.

, Recording yourself can be a good exercise for identifying your quirks and pinpointing areas you need to improve on.


Set up a camera and record yourself doing a monologue or a scene with a partner. You may not like how you look or how you sound, but that’s ok. Take notes on what you are doing, how much or little you are moving, and if you believe your performance.
Watching yourself perform with an objective eye can really show you what you need to work on. Perhaps you don’t enunciate enough or you’re always touching your face. Maybe your movements are too big and unrealistic. Write down the areas you want to improve. Then go back and try it again.

, With so much technology and resources available to us, it’s easy to create your own production, whether it’s film or on stage.


You can rent out a small theatre space and put up your own play or get some camera equipment and shoot a web series. Doing the work yourself will give you a new viewpoint on your craft. When you put up your own production you challenge yourself to do your best work.
Having something that you’ve created and that others will see can help you develop your own style and become a better actor. You’ll find through the process what you like and don’t like. What works for you and what doesn’t. And because it’s on you, you know you won’t slack off or phone it in.

Meditate and explore your inner self.,
Practice cold readings.,
Notate your lines.,
Use what you’ve learned in your work.",How to Strengthen Your Acting Skills3," Meditating for a few minutes and allowing yourself to discover what makes you tick will help you connect to the characters you play.


Meditating can also be a daily ritual that doesn’t have to be done on the floor. It can be done through activities that fuel you and your artistic talents. Chances are, you’re an artist because you felt a calling to it. Acting is a tough business that often has you running around trying to balance jobs that pay the bills with your art.
Try taking some time every day to perform your monologue. Read a play or book. Or even watch your favorite movie. These can all be forms of self-discovery and exploration. Find what helps you stay connected to your creative process and not loose sight of your goals and love for the art. , Grab another actor friend or anyone who will read with you and practice your cold readings. Cold readings are a big part of auditioning, as well as helping you to better your skill. When you practice cold reads, or perform one in an audition, there are a few things you should make strong decisions on:

Relationship. Who is your scene partner to you (in the scene)? What do you need from this person? Always pick positives. Even if you hate this character, you love this character. Hate gives you nowhere to go. Love allows you to explore options.
Conflict. Find the conflict in the scene. What is it that you and your partner are both fighting for? Only one of you can win. Practicing these cold reads will help you understand how to win using only what’s on the page and within you.
Place. Know where you are. Learn to visualize this place. Pick places that are real and that are familiar to you. It doesn’t matter if your partner has a different place in mind. Having intimate knowledge and details in your mind of where you are will change how you behave in the space.
Moment before. Every scene has a beginning. But something always happens off stage before this moment. Learn to decide with confidence what your character was doing before the moment on the page. Having a moment before will affect how you start the scene. It will allow you to act with a stronger choice at the top and inform your partner and the auditors that you didn’t just flip on the lights when the scene started.



, Going over your lines notating your discoveries and details like place, moment before, conflict, etc. will help you improve how you perform a scene. If a certain line reminds you of something from your own life, make a note of it. When you are performing you will be reminded of your own experience. This will allow you to draw on the feelings, body language, and emotions that you had. You can pour these elements into your scene.
Make notes of what your objective in a scene is, and the lines that help you achieve it. For example, if you want your mother to make you a sandwich, note which lines help you achieve that goal. This will give your lines purpose and let you learn to mean what you say instead of just reciting words on a page.
Make notes of what other characters say about your character, especially in scenes your character isn’t in. This will give you insight into who your character is. What others say about you is true. You can use this knowledge to become your character and deliver a three-dimensional performance. This is known as given circumstances. The playwright has given you the facts about your character. You can then use these facts to inform your character. , To truly improve your acting skills you have to learn to incorporate everything you’ve learned into your process in a way that serves you.


When taking classes and reading plays and books you will learn many different theories and methods. Not every one will work for you or be beneficial. But don’t discount something until you’ve tried it.
Formulate your own process using what you’ve learned. Apply it to everything from learning lines to performing. Over time, you will develop a process that allows you to dig deep and get the best results out of your work. To keep improving, you should be willing to adapt and change that process as you continue to learn.
Use your knowledge and the skills you have for everything. Performing, taking classes, and studying are all ways that you can improve. Use what you have and what you know works and treat every audition, scene, or play as if it’s the most important work you’ve ever done. Skimping on the process won’t help you get better.
Use your real life experiences to help you as well. As you get older and experience more of life you’ll have a bank of experiences which you can apply to a character. You’ll be surprised at how a play you read five ago suddenly makes so much more sense and connects with you now. Use your own life to build three-dimensional characters.

Relax your body.,
Walk out of step.,
Lose your coordination.,
Avoid the straight path.,
”Injure” yourself.,
Attack with your mouth.",How to Walk Like a Zombie1," Remember that your muscles may not be receiving messages from the brain, and even if they are, they may be too deteriorated to follow commands anyway. Allow your spine to sway this way and that. Keep your shoulders slouched.Keep your arms down. Discard the outdated pose of a zombie walking around with its arms held out straight in front of it. Stick to poses and movements that are unique to zombies, rather than those shared with mummies, vampires, Frankensteins, etc.Forget that you even have arms until you need to use them. Let your arms hang by your sides when not in use.;
, Avoid even steps. Also avoid creating a pattern out of your uneven steps. Make your steps awkward and erratic.


Imagine you’re learning how to walk. Watch an infant take its first steps. Notice how jerky and hesitant its movements are. Mimic that uncertainty.

, Trip yourself up. Think of the act of walking as a team sport, with your brain as the coach and each thigh, knee, calf, ankle, and foot as individual players. Now imagine that those players have no idea what their positions are, how to work together, or even how to play the game, and so they’re constantly getting in each other’s way.

, When you’re lumbering around aimlessly, think of yourself as a boat adrift in open currents and let them take you where they may; for instance, if the ground under your feet is sloping downhill, follow the easy path and let gravity take you downhill, too. If you’re trying to get from Point A to Point B, move with purpose, but also with a lack of direction, so that you have to constantly readjust your course.

, Whether you’ve been reanimated after a violent death or been attacked by humans since rising from the dead, consider how and where your body may have been damaged beyond repair. Incorporate that injury into your walk; for example, drag your shattered foot behind you with your forward leg bearing the brunt of your weight, or let your dislocated arm hang loosely by your side, weighing your shoulder down.


Be consistent. Remember which leg is limping and which arm is useless. Practice walking with each injury until you can stick to it without having to think about it.
For multiple injuries, practice each one separately until you nail it. Then combine them, one at a time, and practice them together until they feel natural.

, When you go after a human, lead with your mouth. Think of the distance that commands have to travel from your brain to your mouth, arms, and hands respectively. Respond to your brain’s command of “Eat those brains!” with your mouth first, since it’s closest. Freak your prey out with a more animal-like attack."
"
Keep your mouth closed.,
Assume a blank stare.,
Cock your head at an odd angle.",How to Walk Like a Zombie2," Keep in mind that your gums and tongue should have decayed as much as the rest of your body. Unless you’re going to dye the inside of your mouth black, hide that pretty pink flesh from view.Keep your jaw relaxed and loose for a more vacant expression, but be careful not to part your lips too wide., Keep the muscles in your face relaxed, especially those in your eyes, cheeks, and brow. Use your peripheral vision to look where you’re going. Avoid focusing straight ahead, which may cause you to squint and/or crease your brow without you realizing it.


To give those humans an extra scare, keep your stare blank and your vision peripheral until you finally “notice” them. Then zero straight in on them with single-minded intent.
Resist blinking. Remember, your brain and body aren’t working right. Minimize involuntary actions like blinking to indicate damage. Disconcert those pesky humans with long, unblinking stares., Hold your head any which way but straight and forward. Indicate that the wiring between your brain and body are too impaired to hold your head normally. Let it roll around with every step, as if you’re unable to hold it in place at all, or imagine that your neck is broken and hold your head at an unnaturally stiff angle.


For scary contrast, suddenly straighten your head the instant when some yummy brains catch your eye.

Be single minded.,
Imagine being drunk.",How to Walk Like a Zombie3," Act like you’re still capable of thought. Remember that a zombie is reanimated flesh, which includes the brain; the only change is that it's decayed and not working as well as it used to.Impair your thought process. Know exactly what you want (food–or, more specifically, yummy human brains) but be far less sure of how to get it. Pretend that even the simplest tasks require way more problem-solving than normal, including problem-solving!, Think of how decayed your body is, including all the relays between your brain and each part of your body. Imagine every joint in your body as a relay station that isn’t working right. For every command your brain sends to any part of your body, picture the command traveling down the wire and meeting interference along the way before it reaches its final destination.

, Think one thought: “Me want brains!” Focus on your one objective. Move with that one purpose. Ignore everything else.

, Since alcohol clouds the thought-process and impairs motor function, drunk people pretty much act like zombies, so study their behavior to mimic later.Notice the way they hardly ever walk straight. Note how they have to constantly stop what they’re doing and rethink how to do it. Also pay attention to what stimuli they fail to react to right away or even notice at all.

Once you've set your time, set a place, and have people, you're ready!",How to Start an Acting Workshop," You have to start somewhere, so, make a list of what you want to do.



Teaching. Teaching acting is an art, you have to know how to act before you can teach.

Vocal warm-ups. Warming up to act is a very important step in acting. If your body's not ready, neither are you. Plus, you could do some serious damage if you don't warm up correctly.

Acting. Acting is the overall thing in theater; you and many people will benefit from taking an acting class/workshop.;
, ""Two heads are better than one"", as they say, and it's perfectly true.


Get some friends who share your passion, or maybe an experienced director.

, There's a lot to do, before you can start teaching, and it may be frustrating to figure out, that's why support and time, will make it all the easier.


Ask for a few donations, to help get you going.

, Planning a workshop is essential to making it work.


Choose and confirm a location that you have easy and regular access to.
Choose a time that will work for others as well as yourself. Try not to make it more than two hours.

,, Some places might be nice, and let you use the location free, but with the economy, it'll be hard to find. If you can find a free place, say a nice thank you, and move on if needed. If you can't, it will be reasonable to have a small fee, for the workshop. Remember, the higher the fee, the more work you will have to put in to it.

, Finally, you set everything up! Now, it's time to get the word out.

Choose audition scenes for readings at the casting calls.,
Make a firm schedule.,
Create information sheets to distribute to the actors who come to the audition.",How to Set up a Casting Call,"


Before you begin searching for possible casting call locations, be certain of your budget. Knowing exactly what you can spend for venue rental will help you to avoid embarrassment or disappointment. It will also save you time; knowing how much you can spend will help you rule out venues that have more costly rental fees.
You will definitely need a location with two separate rooms, so before you commit to a space, be sure it has them. Also look at the size of the rooms; it is essential that the room in which the actors will prepare has ample space so they are not crowded together. Likewise, the room in which the actual auditions will be held should be spacious enough to allow for free movement.;
,


It is imperative that you get the word out about your casting call, and there are a number of ways to accomplish this. Depending on the size of the production, consider sending information about your auditions to casting agencies and newspapers. For smaller auditions such as community theater, local newspapers often offer free advertising for community events, so be sure to check into that. Additionally, many newspapers have websites, which means information about your casting call will reach an even wider audience. Call local theater groups or colleges and ask for the names and email addresses of local thespians so you can send personal invitations.
Be sure any information you submit to media outlets has thorough descriptions of all parts you are looking to cast. If your show has no children's roles, it would be a waste of time for everyone involved for children to come to the casting call. Include the ages, genders, body types and ethnicities of the characters you are casting. If you are casting a large number of children, send notices of your casting call to area school district offices.
If the casting call is for a film, television show or commercial, consider sending the information about the auditions to your local or state film commission. Film commissions have websites where they post upcoming casting calls.

,


Try to select scenes that will allow actors to show a range of emotions. Audition scenes should be relatively short, and when possible, choose scenes that include several actors and actresses. This will allow you to see what those who are auditioning will look like together on stage and how well they interact.

,


Give actors and actresses time slots for their auditions, and notify them ahead of time if possible. Be sure to make the time blocks ample enough to allow for mistake correction and to allow the actors to try doing scenes in a couple of different ways.

,


On one of the sheets, clearly outline the days of the production and the rehearsal schedule to give to those actors who make the cut. This will allow the actors and actresses you select to let you know right away if they have any scheduling conflicts.
Make an additional information sheet on which the actors will provide you with their contact information including mailing addresses, home and cellular telephone numbers and email addresses.

Choreograph the fight.,
Determine what to do at the moment of impact.,
Collapse to the stage.,
Labor through your final lines.",How to Pretend to Die on Stage1," In many cases, when you’re playing a character who dies a violent death, there is a fight that precedes the actual death. Whether your character is killed by a knife, gun, or some type of beating, you may need to engage in a struggle prior to the moment of death. It’s important to understand the action that will lead up to that moment, so neither you or your co-stars are injured.In most plays, the director usually takes care of the details of fights and other choreographed action, but make sure that you understand exactly how the scene will play out and run through it with your co-stars.
Not all violent on stage deaths are preceded by a fight. Your character may be stabbed without warning or shot from across the stage. In some cases, your character may be taking his or her own life by violent means, so there isn’t an altercation with another character. It’s still important to ensure that you understand the actions that you must take before the death occurs, so the moment is believable.;
, Depending on the method used to kill your character, the actions that you take can differ. For example, if you character is stabbed, it might be more believable for you to fall forward onto the person stabbing you. On the other hand, if you are shot, the force of the bullet would probably propel you backward. Consider the nature of the death carefully, so you can come up with the most convincing way to react to the death blow.Your director probably has an idea of how you should react at the moment of impact, but make sure that it’s something that feels authentic to you. You won’t be able to sell a convincing death if you don’t believe in the performance yourself.
Poisoning is a violent death that doesn’t necessarily have a moment of impact. However, you may want to cough or wretch to sell the death as the poison is starting to take effect. In general, though, less is more, so don’t go overboard with gagging and coughing if you want to be convincing.
Certain types of death, such as a hanging, may require special stage directions and effects at the moment of impact. It’s important that you understand all of the technical aspects, so the death is convincing but also to ensure that you don’t hurt yourself.

, After your character has been shot, stabbed, beaten, or otherwise injured, you’ll need to collapse to convey that you are dying. In some cases, you may be in another actor’s arms, so your co-star can guide you to the stage. However, if you are standing by yourself, there is no one to slow your fall and you run the risk of injuring yourself. To minimize the impact, consider collapsing in stages. For example, drop to your knees first and then collapse to the stage so you aren't falling as far.Depending on where you are on the stage during the death scene, you may be able to use a piece of scenery or a prop to ease your fall. For example, you might collapse against a table or a column to help slow down the fall.
The most convincing way to fall is to allow your body to go limp. Avoid convulsions and other distracting gestures because they usually seem over the top.

, If you have lines to recite just before your character dies, you want to deliver them in a convincing way. With a violent death, such as a shooting or stabbing, the trauma associated with it would likely make it difficult for your character to speak. Try to simulate labored breathing and recite the lines in a halting manner before closing your eyes.It’s almost important to consider who your character is saying the final lines to. They should probably come out harsher if you’re speaking to the murderer, as opposed to a friend or loved one.

"
"
Find the right position.,
Determine the amount of pain your character is experiencing.,
Deliver your final lines quietly.",How to Pretend to Die on Stage2," If your character is dying of natural causes, such as cancer or old age, you’ll likely be in a bed or even a chair for the death scene. However, if your character dies suddenly of a heart attack, you may be standing at the time of death and have to collapse as you would with a violent death. Make sure that you understand the staging, so you can plan how you will act out the moment of death.If your character is dying in bed, loved ones may be gathered around. If that’s the case, it may make sense for you to embrace or hold a co-star’s hand. Check with the director to see what the best approach is.

, When you’re acting out a natural death, the scene is usually quieter and more subtle. However, death by natural causes can still be painful, so it’s important to have an idea of how much pain your character is in. For example, if you’re playing an older character who dies because his heart stops, you might not experience much pain. On the other hand, if your character dies of a heart attack, you may suffer from intense pain.You can convey pain in a variety of ways, but grimacing and sharp intakes of breath are effective, subtle gestures that usually work well.
If your death scene involves a heart attack, you may want to clutch at your chest or arm because that’s where victims usually feel pain.

, When you’re playing a character who dies of a natural death, the scene often involves quietly drifting off. If that’s the case, it’s best to deliver your final lines in a low, weak voice to convey how frail your character is. You might whisper the lines or give your voice a throaty quality to indicate impending death.While you want to keep your voice low to make the death scene believable, you shouldn't go for a real life whisper, but a stage whisper so everyone in the theater can hear you. To ensure that you can be heard, practice with a cast or crew member at the back of the theater to check how audible you are."
"
Choose a convincing final position.,
Keep still.,
Take shallow breaths.",How to Pretend to Die on Stage3," In most cases, your character will remain on the stage for a least a few minutes after the death. In order to really sell the death, you should “die” on your stomach or on your side with your back to the audience. That way, it won’t be as obvious that you’re still breathing after your character has supposedly died.It’s important to practice the choreography that places you in your final position for the death. You don’t want to have to roll over or adjust yourself in the middle of the scene.

, Just because you’re no longer involved in the play’s action doesn’t mean that your work is over. The other cast members need to believe that your character is truly dead, so they can convincingly play the emotions that they go through in the aftermath. That means it’s imperative that you remain still after you’ve “died.” Even something as small as using your thumb to scratch the palm of your hand can pull them out of the moment.If you know that you have difficulty remaining still, talk to the director to see if there is any way to conceal you. For example, it might be appropriate to have the other characters cover you with a sheet. It may also be possible to stage the death so it takes place further back on the stage where they can lower the lights.

, Even if you’re concealed under a sheet or dimmed lights, you may still be noticeable to your co-stars, as well as the audience. If you’re breathing deeply, there may be movement that shatters the illusion even if you’re doing your best to remain still. For the few minutes that you have to remain on stage after the death, try to take slow, shallow breaths, as you would if sleeping, so your chest doesn’t move as much.Keeping your mouth closed and breathing through your nose can often help you keep your breathing shallow.
Try to take as deep a breath as you can during the actual death scene, so you have some time before you need to breathe deeply again. You can disguise it by gasping or shuddering through it.

"
"
Consider the genre.,
Research the mode of death.,
Talk to the director.",How to Pretend to Die on Stage4," When you’re preparing for your death scene, it’s important to take the genre of the play or skit into consideration. If the play is a tragedy, you want to portray the death in a serious way that really ratchets up the emotion. On the other hand, if your play is a comedy, it may call for a more over the top take on the death.If your dealing with the horror genre, building up fear and suspense is also an important part of a death scene. In the moments before the death, you should play the character as terrified, with trembling or shivering, so the audience will feel the fear along with you.

, If you want to play the death in a convincing manner, it often helps to study up on the way that you're dying so you understand what your character would experience. For example, you might do an online search for symptoms of a heart attack to help you mimic the gestures that a person would make under those circumstances.You may want to think about how realistic your death scene should be. For example, in some modern, avant garde theater, the goal may not be realism, but a bold artistic statement.

, Before you start thinking about how you plan to play the death scene, it’s always best to have a discussion with the director. He or she will likely have very clear ideas about how the scene should unfold, which can help guide you in the right direction. In addition to technical details such as staging and choreography, the director may also be able to help you understand your character’s emotions throughout the death scene.While you should listen to the director’s vision for the scene, make sure that you’re comfortable with the staging and interpretation because you’re the one who has to play it.

Research some good monologue options.,
Read through.,
Read the play.,
Read aloud.,
Plan your movement.,
Start memorizing.,
Repeat.,
Start the monologue from beginning.,
Take a break from memorizing.,
Continue practicing until it flows naturally.,
Perform it, knowing you're ready.",How to Rehearse a Monologue for an Audition," You can find some monologues through multiple channels:


Internet. Look for some monologues using keywords, such as contemporary or classical, female or male. If you want to be more specific, you can search with an age range too.
Plays. If you like any particular plays, you can use the internet to search for monologues for these plays, or you can find a monologue yourself just by looking in the script for the play.;
, Read each monologue to see whether you like it. If you do, great, move on to the next step. However, if you do not like the monologue chosen, then your performance isn't going to be great, so keep looking until you have found one you like.

, Reading the play will help with your performance when it comes to the audition. The more you read of it, the more in-depth your character becomes, and you will find this a lot more easier to play rather than not knowing your character at all.

, Read the monologue aloud for a while, whilst moving around. This is the starting point to your performance, and this will help you get the sense of the text.

, Once you have done the above step, try to incorporate movement into the monologue. This doesn't mean what you did in the previous step when you could just walk around, this time you have to see if you can dig deeper into the monologue and see if you can choreograph some movements into each word or sentence you say.

, Now try to say the first sentence and the movement that goes with it, without the monologue. This may be hard at first, but keep trying until you have it.

, Remember to keep repeating the 'Movement' step and 'Start Memorizing' step until you can remember the first line. Then, keep doing this for each small section.

, Once you can remember at least half of the monologue, start the monologue from the beginning without the text in front of you, and keep going until you have gone as far as you remember.

, Too much can make matters worse for you. Once you have had a break - perhaps by playing a game or focusing on something else - repeat the above step, to ensure that you still have the previous parts memorized.

, Now continue memorizing each section using each step above in the 'Memorizing Your Monologue' part until you can remember the whole monologue with the movement, feeling, and without the text in front of you. Every day, keep rehearsing your monologue until audition day comes.

, Once audition day is here, make sure you are completely prepared. Don't feel scared, or nervous, and certainly don't talk to too many people who are auditioning for the same part as you. (An exception to this 'rule' would be if you are auditioning for something like The National Youth Theatre, as teamwork is essential).

Learn the causes of fainting.,
Learn the symptoms of fainting.,
Decide on a harmless reason for your fake faint.,
Map out how your fake faint will happen.,
Know how your fake fainting spell will happen.,
Plan your exit.",How to Pretend to Faint1," Fainting is a common malady that many people experience. Its causes can be either harmless or life threatening. Since you’re planning to fake faint, it’s better to learn about the relatively harmless reasons people faint. Fainting is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.


A harmless fainting spell can be caused by low blood pressure or a nervous system response that reduces blood flow to the brain.Such a nervous system response could be the result of highly stressful or traumatic event, fear, or pain.
For teenagers, fake fainting is a perfect excuse to avoid an event or exam, since it’s common for them to experience real, but harmless, fainting spells. For adults who are older, it’s possible for them to experience a harmless fainting spell once or twice a year; but anything more than that might be considered the result of something life-threatening.;
, A person who faints can experience several symptoms leading up to losing consciousness, including feeling very hot, nauseous, lightheaded or confused, or hyperventilating. A person might also feel dizzy or weak, or have ringing ears or experience a temporary loss of hearing. These symptoms are common for someone who experiences a harmless fainting spell.

, Unless you need to fake a fainting spell for a dramatic play, you’ll need to come up with a reason for your fake fainting spell that won’t compel people to call an ambulance, and that will also allow you to walk away seemingly shaken up, but unharmed. Because low blood pressure and low blood flow to the brain are usually the causes of harmless fainting spells, there are several scenarios that could cause that type of fainting.Not eating breakfast or waiting too long between meals to eat something can cause low blood pressure. Not drinking enough water can cause dehydration and reduce blood flow to the brain.
If you happen to be outside or in a really stuffy room, you could say that you got too hot. You could pretend to experience a stressful or traumatic event. If you’re easily scared by bugs or loud noises, you could pretend your fear caused you to hyperventilate, and then faint.
If you decide to let someone in on your plan to fake faint, you could have them hit or slap you so hard you faint. Now this might be a little dramatic and may have repercussions for the person helping you out, but it is a valid reason for a fainting spell that won’t seem life-threatening.

, In order for your fake fainting spell to have as little blowback as possible, and to achieve the result you’re looking for, you’ll need to have it planned out as best you can. Your reason for wanting to fake faint will determine the location where it happens. You may have a little more control over when it happens. But you need to have extreme control over how it happens, so as not to injure yourself or cause unintended consequences.


What are you trying to avoid? A friend’s wedding? An exam you haven’t studied for? Maybe you’re singing to an auditorium of your peers, and you don’t feel ready.
To minimize the blowback from your fake fainting spell, you may want to fake faint in front of only a few people. Fainting in front of a lot of people might expose you to some who can easily detect a fake fainting spell, and it might also make the moment bigger than you want it to be, hindering a quick exit.
You also don’t want to faint during an important event that might affect other people, such as your friend’s wedding, while someone’s receiving an award, or during the test you’re trying to avoid. Plan for your fake fainting spell to happen before the event you’re trying to avoid.

, Will you be standing or sitting? What symptoms do you think you can effectively mimic? Which way will you fall when pretending to faint? How long will you pretend to be unconscious? Have these questions answered.


It’s important to do a dry run of your fake fainting spell. You don’t want to think you can pull it off, only to realize during the act that you’re afraid of falling and bumping your head or that you can’t hyperventilate without smiling. You also want to ensure that you fall as safely as possible in order to minimize potential injury.
Know exactly what you’re going to do, so that when you fake faint in front of other people, it will go smoothly.

, You should only pretend to be unconscious for a few seconds, and a maximum of 20 seconds. Once a person falls to the floor or reclines enough so that his or her head is parallel to the heart, blood flow is almost immediately restored to the brain, as is consciousness.Once you pretend to awaken from your loss of conscious, don’t jump up immediately and act as if everything is fine. Plan to sit for a few minutes, since it takes about that long for a person to recover from a real fainting spell. Knowing this is important.
You don’t want to faint during a time-sensitive event and expect to run out immediately afterwards. Also prepare to explain away your fainting as no big deal, so that once you should feel fine to stand up and walk away, you can exit the area as quickly as possible.

"
"
Set the stage for your fake fainting spell.,
Complain about having symptoms of fainting.,
Get in position where you’ll faint.,
Pretend to faint.,
Pretend to be unconscious for a few seconds.,
Open your eyes and take a deep breath.,
Sit up slowly and after a moment, stand, or get someone to pull you to your feet.,
Make a semi-haste exit.",How to Pretend to Faint2," Now that you’re prepared to make a fake faint look real, you can now make it happen. Once you’re where you want your fake fainting spell to happen, make sure the conditions are right for it to occur the way you want it to.


Are enough or the right people present? Is the event you’re trying to avoid still happening? Is the hallway too crowded?
Once you know things seem right, move to the general area where you want your fake fainting spell to occur. A real fainting spell happens fairly quickly from the onset of symptoms.
Make sure there aren’t dangerous objects nearby that could cause serious injury if you happen to hit them when falling. And make sure you won’t hit anyone.

, When you’re ready, begin exhibiting symptoms of fainting. This should only occur for a few minutes in total. If you plan to use not as your excuse not eating breakfast, mention that you’re very hungry. If the room is crowded or stuffy, you could start complaining about feeling hot. If you’re walking, start slowing down, hold your head a little, and say you feel dizzy. You can blink or squint your eyes. Complain of nausea. Pretend to suddenly lose energy, and say you feel weak. Keep up this last symptom for 1-2 minutes.

, While exhibiting your symptoms, and without drawing attention to your movements, move into the spot where it seems safest to fall. If you plan on fainting while sitting, pretend you’re too weak to stand and take a seat. You can say that you feel kind of weird and that you think you need a glass of water or some fresh air.


Maybe ask someone to open a window. If you are windowless or have no water around, just say you think you need to sit down, or go out for fresh air. Sit for a bit and get up slowly. Then stumble a bit and fall forward. Before you do that say something such as ""I just...."" Make sure you don't finish your sentence, unless it's short.

, Make sure you fall safely. You don't want to hit your head and hurt yourself. If you are standing, buckle your knees and let them hit the ground before you attempt to drop your torso. Make sure you go fast enough without making it look as if a 5000 volt surge of lightning has rushed though you, or it will seem fake.


If you are sitting, relax and imagine you actually are fainting. Let yourself fall off the chair, as it is unlikely you would stay on there if you actually did faint.
Try to land on the back side of your thigh, not your hip or tailbone. Then quickly drop your torso. Just close your eyes and let all your muscles completely weaken; just relax.
Act as if you have no bones and fall to the floor in a crumpled heap. This will seem real.

, Lie on the ground. Make sure you aren't stiff, and if someone attempts to lift an arm and shake it, let it completely relax and when they drop it, just let it fall. This is a common 'fake spotter' test. Unconscious people don't have control over their limbs. Someone should come over to see if you are okay, causing a diversion for whatever occasion.


Don't stay down there too long, or someone might call the Emergency Services. Unless you want that to happen, make sure you don't stay out for more than 20 seconds.

, People who have fainted will often awaken having not remembered that they fainted. Say all you can remember is feeling hot and that it looked as though someone dimmed the lights in the room.

, After a moment, you can attempt to stand and sort of waver a bit again, so people think you might faint again and will all rush to your aid. At this moment, if people are asking you questions, you can begin to explain your fake faint away as harmless.

, Rest for about ten minutes or so to pretend to recover from your fake fainting spell. When you’re ready, excuse yourself to either go home to rest or to set an appointment to visit your doctor. Someone may offer to take you somewhere, you can either accept their generosity or explain that you can get safely to your destination on your own.

Watch anime, movies and cartoons where characters go insane.,
Go to a role play, improvisation (improv), or acting class and spectate.,
Aim to be realistic.",How to Roleplay As an Insane Character1," After those examples, write down a few lines they said that really evoke the ""insane"" vibe for your particular character.


Some insane characters may play mind games, seek to manipulate or harm others. In some cases, such as Sonozaki  Shion, they may even kill people.
Other insane characters are highly intelligent or creative. For example, think of The Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Understand that creativity and insanity often dance very closely together.;
, You never know if an insane character will pop up and really stoke your inspiration.


If possible, watch a recorded role play, perhaps from YouTube or similar video sites online. Study what these characters are doing and the way in which they portray insanity successfully.

, Remember that an insane character is not annoying! If you see a good starting insane character who then becomes annoying, don't use this character as your model.


Some things that can count as being annoying include: Laughing too much, saying constantly stupid things, losing the plot too often, etc. Always be ready to roleplay an insane character with an edge of intelligence and sensitivity.

"
"
Enter a role play and be an insane character.,
Make your insane character.",How to Roleplay As an Insane Character2," As already stated, there is a thin line between insane and annoying, so be sure to steer clear of this.


Don't laugh every five minutes. Laugh when it is appropriate for your character. For example, if your character is evilly insane, he or she might laugh if a character dies or if your character kills a character in roleplay mode.
If your character likes pain, roleplay someone who inflicts pain on others and doesn't care about the feelings or pain of others.
Don't threaten to kill (in role play) every single time someone comes near you––this soon turns dull and lessens the intelligent enjoyment of the game.
Swear words may suit some characters, but are not required to make an insane character sound even more insane. Only use these if it is appropriate for the character in question.

, Write a dialogue for him or her. Make it sound as if they are really insane, both within themselves (a tortured or a vacant soul) and out (uncaring, quirky, mysterious, unpredictable, threatening, retreating, etc.).


Write down an insanity level. This will give you the bold outline that is needed.

Take deliberate steps.,
Watch where you are walking.,
Walk in a crouch to take lighter steps.,
Breathe slowly and steadily.",How to Pretend to Be an Assassin1," As an assassin, you must move with a specific purpose. Keep your muscles tight and under control. Move slowly so you have time to think and react to whatever comes your way. Set your toes down first and slowly roll your foot until your heel is down. This let's you gauge how much sound your foot will make.This is counterintuitive because most people walk heel to toe, but stepping with the toe first gives you more control.
As you step, balance on your back foot and slowly transfer your weight to your front foot.;
, As you walk slowly, pay attention to the ground in front of you. When you’re outside, try to walk on concrete, bare dirt, or grass, as opposed to dried brush. Watch out for sticks, pine cones, plastic cups, pop cans, toys, and anything else that might make noise if you stepped on it.You don’t want to stare at the ground the whole time you walk. Glance down before each step and then look back up at what is around you.

, Standing fully upright when you walk tends to make your steps louder. Bend your knees to lower your body about six to twelve inches from your normal height. Bent knees help you control the weight of the steps you take.Being lower to the ground also improves your balance, which is an asset to an assassin. It’s especially helpful if you are walking on any kind of unstable terrain.

, Your breathing can cause a lot of noise if you don’t control it. Breathe through your nose more than your mouth, as it tends to be quieter. Take consistent slow breaths to keep your oxygen intake steady.Fight the urge to hold your breath because this actually ends up being louder when you have to gasp for air.
Practice breathing in for three seconds then breathing out for three seconds. This is a good pattern that you can maintain, and it gets you plenty of oxygen.

"
"
Study the details of the area around you closely.,
Concentrate on what you hear.,
Identify the smells around you.",How to Pretend to Be an Assassin2," Assassins must be aware of everything around them, but regular people usually aren’t. Scan in all directions and notice simple things you’d usually miss. Move your eyes in a pattern and try to memorize the details of everything around you.To practice this, find a place outside to sit and watch what’s going on for three to five minutes. Look at what people are wearing. Take note of street signs and store fronts. Look for trash or other objects that are scattered around.
Being an effective assassin, even pretending, means noticing things that could interfere with your mission. Seeing everything is an important step toward noticing more.

, You hear things even when you don't see them, which is vital to an assassin. Learn to put extra focus on what your ears are picking up. Drown out the common sounds like traffic or conversation and listen for smaller sounds like bugs, footsteps, and the rustle of the wind.Practice by sitting outside again, but instead of watching, close your eyes and listen. Make a specific mental note of what sounds you hear.
Pay special attention to sounds you typically don’t notice, or ones that are quieter than the other sounds. Take note of how close or far various sounds are in relation to you.
When you’re pretending to be an assassin, never rely fully on your sight. Let your ears do half of the work in gathering information about what’s around you.

, Ancient humans who had to hunt to eat had a keener sense of smell than we do, because they had to. As you are breathing slowly through your nose, identify distinct smells around you. Pay attention if the smell changes.Sitting outside again, breathe deeply and pinpoint as many smells as you can. There will most likely be one or two that are most prevalent, but notice the others.
Go around your house or outdoors and purposefully smell as many things as you can. Learn to memorize scents that are subtler or normally overlooked.

"
"
Wear clothes that help you blend in.,
Wear clothing that you are comfortable in.,
Wear a backpack if your clothing has few pockets.",How to Pretend to Be an Assassin3," An assassin needs to go unnoticed, and what you wear plays a big part in this. Pay attention to where you’ll be, and dress for that environment. Wear what is comfortable and won’t set you apart from the crowd.One main aspect of this is simple, muted colors. It doesn’t have to be black, white, and gray, but it probably shouldn’t be hot pink and lime green.
Wearing all black with a long trench coat may look cool, but it will also stand out in many settings.
The weather in the area is also a primary factor. Wear warm clothes if it is cold or cool clothes if it is warm. A parka in Florida will make you stand out, and a tank top during Indiana’s winter will, too.

, Choose soft, lightweight fabrics that feel good against your skin. Choose clothing that isn’t too tight or too loose. Baggy clothes can get caught on things, and tight clothes will bother you. Uncomfortable clothing is an unnecessary distraction.

, Assassins need convenient storage for their weapons and tools. If you wear a coat with many pockets, this may be plenty, but if you wear tight-fitting clothes, you’ll need a backpack. The plus side is that in most settings a backpack won’t seem out of place, as many people carry them.


Don’t choose a 30 pound hiking backpack with a dozen pockets, as this is too big and will cause you more problems. Choose a simple, slim backpack with a few pockets. It only needs to be big enough to carry what you need.

Create a death plan.,
Check your surroundings.,
Begin your dying scene.,
Remain completely still.,
Meditate.,
Pick an inanimate object to focus on.,
Hold your breath so that your body doesn't move.,
Take low, shallow breaths.,
Visualize that you are breathing from your breathing in your neck and throat.",How to Play Dead," If you are going to be playing dead in a film scene, or another scenario where you won't need to actually ""die"" in front of an audience, than you don't need to come up with a dying plan. However, if dying in from of the audience is necessary, you must come up with a way to die.


Most plays or movies have this part of the story written out for you, so be sure to practice and rehearse your dying scene.
If you're playing a prank, be sure to practice you're dying scene before you do it in front of others. You'll want it to look as natural as possible. Get a friend involved to give you some feedback as you practice.
Some ways to fake a death would be a heart attack, getting shot, or being stabbed. Some of these methods will require another actor or friend.;
, Whether you're acting in a play or playing a prank, it's important to be aware of your surroundings when you play dead. Make sure you can safely fall or ""be killed"" without getting hurt or hurting others.


If possible, fall onto a soft surface. For example, if you are outside, fall onto the grass instead of the sidewalk. This way, you're less likely to get injured.

, A death scene is when you show your audience how you actually die. This can include screaming, getting shot, clutching your chest, gasping, making pained noises, or simply putting on a frightened expression. Whatever you decide to do, make it convincing. This is why practicing is so important.


Faking a heart attack might include clutching your chest, gasping for air, and falling to the ground. You should look as if you are scared and in pain.
Faking getting shot might include you jolting your body as the fake bullets hit you, holding your hand over your injuries, and falling to the ground. You should look like you're in excruciating pain, and give a painful yell or scream as you get shot. If you get shot in the body, you should stagger backwards before falling. If you get shot in the head, you should fall instantly, as you'd die immediately.
If you want to make a dying statement, make it in a harsh, whispery voice. You'll want to sound like you are in pain and struggling to talk and breathe. Keep the statement short.
After you ""die,"" be sure that you land in a position that you'll be able to stay completely still in.
If you're playing a prank, be aware of your situation. If you are seriously scaring people around you, consider waking up and telling them that it's a joke.

, It's important that you lie perfectly still for the entirely of the death scene that you are playing dead in. Even the smallest movement will show that you are actually alive, so be sure that your dying position is one that you can hold for an extended period of time.


Make sure to position your body in a way that looks dead instead of just asleep. Some ways to do this are to position your body in an unnatural way, bend your limbs so that they look broken, or twist your torso so that it looks like your back is broken.
Practice lying different ways to see which death positions you are most comfortable for you. It's important that you find a comfortable position, as you'll have to hold it, possible for a long time, without moving.
Lying completely still includes your face. Don't smile, or make any other facial movements. Try to keep a blank look on your face. Leave your mouth open so that you're able to breathe without opening and closing your mouth., Meditation will help you get in the right mental state to play dead. Meditation is a key exercise to gain control over your body and mind, so put some time into practicing. Meditation is also a contributing factor to relaxation, and being relaxed will make you a much more convincing dead body.


If your body is stiff or tense, it will be much harder for you to stay completely still. Instead of tensing your muscles, relax your body completely. Visualize a calm, serene place, and allow your body and mind to sink into deep relaxation.Practice meditating by giving yourself a few minutes of meditation time a day. Sit alone, in silence, and clear your mind. You can stop your mind from wandering by counting your breaths as you inhale and exhale.If you have trouble lying still and not moving, try counting to meditate. If you focus your mind on something (like counting), you won't feel as anxious, and your body will appear to be more relaxed.

, It's much easier to play dead with your eyes closed, so always choose that route when possible. However, there are some scenarios where you (or a director, writer, etc.) wants you to act dead with your eyes open. If this is the case, pick an inanimate object to focus on, such as a sign, a chair, a mark on the wall, etc. This will give your eyes a steady gaze and will appear to others as if you are staring into nothingness, much like a dead body.


You cannot blink when you are dead. Practice holding your eyes open without blinking before you actually perform in front of an audience., Mastering different breathing techniques is the most difficult part of playing dead. Typically when you breathe, your entire body moves. This, unfortunately, is a dead giveaway of a living body. Learn to hold your breath for as long as possible.


Holding your breath is a useful technique, because you will have no body movement at all.
Most people can learn to hold their breath for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Practicing holding your breath for as long as possible, but do not hurt yourself. If you try holding your breath for too long, you may actually pass out. If you start to feel dizzy or light headed, stop holding your breath and resume breathing.Some of the best exercises to practice holding your breath are swimming underwater and singing (holding out long notes)., Deep breathing is when you'll see the most body movement in an individual. Keep your breaths low and shallow by slowly inhaling and exhaling small amounts of air at a time. If you run out of air and you must that a breath, try this approach.


Take in the smallest amount of air possible – just enough for you to get by.
Only take a deep breath right before you ""die."" Taking a deep breath before your death scene will give you a good amount of stored air to use while you're playing dead.

, Your lungs will still be working, but this visualization will minimize the movement of your chest cavity. Using visual tools is a great way to trick our body into behaving differently.


Focus only on your neck and throat. Pretend as if all of your air is coming from that area, and not from your chest or abdomen.
When you practice this technique, hold your hand on your throat area to direct your focus. Once you've directed your focus, you should be able to see and feel a difference in your body movements while breathing."

This might be a scam.

, One of the most important things you need to do for an audition is to memorize the script. This signals to the casting director that you take the job seriously, and that you are a professional. Besides just knowing the lines, make sure you understand the character.

Truly listen to their critique, and ask them for advice on how to improve.

, You may go on a dozen auditions and not get a single call-back. This can be hard on the ego and spirit. Try to remember that this is part of the business. There is going to be a lot of competition, and you are not going to get many parts that you go out for. Sometimes, your acting agent will tell you what the casting agents did not like about you or your audition, and you have to be emotionally ready to hear that.

Do something silly.,
Have a group pow-wow.,

Be conscious of your body language.,
Realize it's no biggie.",How to Reduce Stage Fright," Understand that most of the people in the audience would be scared to death to give a speech too, and are glad that it is you and not them! For the occasional speaker, it is okay to say, ""Excuse my nerves, I am not used to this."" When people hear that, they root for the guy, not cut him apart (unless they paid big bucks to be there, in which case, you do need to be skilled.);
, Be overwhelmingly, thoroughly, and completely prepared before taking the stage. If you don't know your lines, your speech, your call to action, then you'll stumble mentally and from there, the sweats and weak knees will soon take over. Much of your fear stems from the anxiety that you will make mistakes, or that the audience will know more than you (including knowing that you don't know). There is one sure way to overcome that, and that is by knowing your material inside and out.

, Okay, you've just being told to know your material thoroughly. Sometimes this just isn't possible, and in such a case, it is very important to focus on the message that needs to get across. For example, it might be an emergency situation and you need to clearly tell people to exit or stay calm. Or, someone might have fallen sick and you need to tell the audience that the speaker isn't available but that you're happy to talk on a topic you do know about, for a much shorter time, or some such compromise. When winging it, remember:


The audience doesn't know that you don't know things to talk about. By acting confident, you reassure them that you do know.
Your tone and your stance are very meaningful. If you have great posture and a clear, calm and resonant voice, along with confident body language, much of what you say will seem convincing, even if it isn't. In fact, this is important whether or not you do know your material!
If the message is important, this can give you a boost of confidence that you may not otherwise have had. If it's to save people's lives, to spread awareness of something you're passionate about or to clarify an important point, you may be able to wing it without stage fright even becoming an issue.

, If you are not calm you'll face more difficulties than usual. To cool yourself down, some of the following suggestions may come in handy.

, Meditation is all about cooling down. Our stress and tiredness make us unhappy, impatient and frustrated. It can even affect our health. Meditation makes your mind calmer and more focused and is a good remedy for stage fright.

, There's no reason to worry about making mistakes. The more you think about messing up, the more likely you are to do it. In order to think positively, you have to change your emotional and mental approach toward yourself, other people and situations.

, Fear is a bodily reflex and one that you can overcome. When you get afraid, you start to breathe in short, fast breaths. Before you speak, or while you are being introduced, aim to sit quietly and breathe with slow, deep breaths. Continue this as you make your way to the stage and while on stage.

, Listening to music that will pump you up can help get you energized, confident, and in the zone. Conversely, listening to soothing music might be best to calm your nerves down.

, Get some exercise beforehand so that you can expend some of that nervous energy in a constructive way. Do some backstage push-ups or jumping jacks.

, You're going to have to leave your inhibitions behind, so you can't worry about looking dumb. The best way to combat this insecurity is to do something that makes you feel silly or embarrassed backstage like making funny faces or dancing around. This can help you get over the feeling and realize that even making a fool of yourself isn't that bad.

, If you're in a band or performing with a group of people, get together right before the show starts to help everyone get focused and on the same page.

, If it's appropriate to your performance, you should make a point to make eye contact with the audience. For musicians and public speakers, eye contact is essential. For athletes and dancers, not so much. Eye contact may seem distracting at first, but the more you do it, the more you'll get used to it.


If you're in a dark club, try looking at the wall on the far end of the room. This way, you're looking up at the crowd, but you won't get distracted since you can't see any audience member's face from that distance. This only really works if there are people standing in the back, of course.

, Shifting your focus from your feelings to others or the materials/job at hand, can help you to overcome stage fright.


If you are part of a play, try to focus on the other actors with whom you are speaking; or imagine you are talking to someone you are comfortable talking to if you are alone on stage.
If you are giving a speech, focus more on the speech, than on the audience's response. If they are encouraging or applauding you, you can be bolstered by this but don't get sidetracked or feel needy for applause. You came to do a job, so keep your focus on that aspect.

, You may tense up again when you first get out there. Acknowledge it and let yourself relax again. Loosen up and move around a little. The crowd wants to see you succeed as much as you do, and they want to see that you're enjoying yourself.

, Avoid nervous body language such as fidgeting and sticking your hands in your pockets. Being more animated will help you loosen up.

, Never forget that when it comes down to it, it's no big deal! You're there to have fun, and you will do your best. Even if it doesn't turn out to be your finest moment, it's not the end of the world.

It is best to get into character at least 10 minutes before the first scene, even if you aren't in it.

",How to Prepare For a Stage Performance," Practice makes perfect, so think of learning your lines as studying for a test that if you fail everyone knows and you can not take it again. Use a highlighter to make your lines jump off the page. When studying, say the words out loud. Have a friend run your lines with you when you're not in rehearsal.;
, Singing memorization is just as important as dialogue. Lyrics can be tricky. Study and go over them as much as possible. Sing in the mirror so you can see what you look like while singing, this helps correct any mistakes you may or may not have made.


Learn your notes and harmonies as well. Even if you know your lyrics, it won't sound as good unless you get the notes right.

, You must have the patience and time' to work at it everyday. Take your time and learn the steps the right way first so you do not have to go back and slow everyone else down.

, Do you want to charm them, offend them, destroy them, etc.? This is called an objective and may change as you go through the rehearsal process and discover new things about the piece.

, In other words, I ""kind of"" love the other person is a weak choice. I'm crazy about the other person is a strong choice. Ambiguity does not work on stage. Remember to exaggerate all character choices so that the story and your character come across clearly.

, This means learning where you are and where you have to go during a scene. In any play you've got to know what's going on around you so you can hear your cue to give a line or move in the scene.

, Acting is work, but you can let loose, and have fun.

, Besides, being too relaxed can hurt your performance.

You don't want to bend your knees too much. This will overextend your knee muscles and will make your movements stiff. You will also tire out more quickly.

, Once you've bent your legs, start rocking back and forth. Engage your legs muscles, moving yourself from side to side at a moderate pace. You can also move your arms and shoulders in time with your rocking motion, making it a whole body movement.








Don't rock too fast. This will cause you to lose your balance or hurt yourself.

, Hold one arm above your head and the other down at your side. It doesn't matter if you have your right or left arm raised. You can start with either arm in this position.








Remember to keep your arms loose. You don't have to lock your elbows, and you can bend your arms slightly if you like.

, Once you master the steps, it's time to incorporate them all together. First, pick a song with a good tempo. Once you have your song on, do all the steps together. Bend your knees and hold your arms in position, rocking back and forth to the beat.









Hip hop songs work great for this dance. Try the song ""Do the #Nae Nae"" by WeAreToonz. They wrote the song specifically for this dance.Try this dance in front of a mirror if you can't seem to get the moves right. This way, you can see how you are moving your body and change any move you are doing incorrectly.

, Don't worry so much about sticking strictly to the basic steps. Once you've gotten the hang of the basic steps, you can incorporate a swagger to your moves, swinging your hips more as you rock back and forth. You can also move your arms and shoulders around, shimmying your shoulders back and forth as you rock your body.








Feel free to switch your arms back and forth as well, holding your right arm up for three or four counts and then switching arms., While you are doing the basic Nae Nae, think about some dance moves you can do during the freestyle portions, which are called the Four Counts. You can incorporate any dance that you want, as long as it lasts the four counts that are dedicated to freestyle moves.







, Once you've done the Nae Nae for awhile, it's time to break into your freestyle. Start your freestyle, do the moves for four counts, and then move back into the Nae Nae. You can do the freestyle as many times as you like, moving from the basic move to the freestyle and back every few counts.









Try doing another dance move you love, such as the Dougie or Macarena. You can create new dance moves of your own. You can even amp it up a notch by doing a head stand or back flip.There is no one way to do freestyle. This portion is all about you and doing whatever dance move you feel you want to perform. Just listen to the music and trust your instincts.

, Although there are specific moves that are considered the Nae Nae, it is meant to be a social dance that you can enjoy doing in large groups. Try it out with some friends, feeding off their energy and excitement. You can also take turns doing freestyle, incorporating their moves into yours.

Your heart must be into it. Maybe you want to dance to look good in front of boys or girls. However, to look good, you must ignore how other people view you, and concentrate solely on yourself. Your heart must be ‘fully’ into it. If your heart is not into dancing, you will most likely give up when you cannot do certain moves, because it will stress you out. But if you have a desire, you will stick to learning one move until you get it down.;
, There are many legendary dancers who encourage many amateur dancers. It is good to look up to them and learn how they learned how to dance. Of course, you should not try to imitate moves that the professional dancers do. It is very hard. But let me remind you this; pick one of your favorite dancers, and whenever you dance, think of him/her and imagine yourself as if you are him/her. Let him/her be your invisible teacher!

, You can either take classes or learn it by yourself. A lot of people watch videos and try to follow along, but most of the time it is difficult. You need someone who can take a look at your moves you have taught yourself, someone you look up to, and he/she can fix your problems.

Maybe you and your friends can be the world-best dancing group in the future.

, Maybe your friends would tell you that you are bad at dancing. Just ignore them. Even though you think you are bad at dancing, stand in front of a mirror and look at yourself. Why not? Why would you think that you cannot dance? Never let yourself down. Tell yourself, You can do it man! You’re just either too scared to show off or too lazy to practice! Of course I can do it! I’ll get the moves down and show them who I am. That’s right!

, If you want to breakdance, also known as ‘b-boying,’ you first need to know what kind of dance it is. It involves a lot of strength, along with your own creative styles. For this, you have got to be into it. You may feel like the moves you want to learn are so hard, that you just want to give up, but have faith in yourself. There are tons and tons of different moves for breakdance, because you can learn any one of the moves, and transform it into your own style.

, So you should start practicing when you’re young, or have natural skills. If you do not have natural skills and didn’t even know about popping when you were a kid, it will require a lot of practices, for popping is literally popping your body on beats. It will either look good with the music or make the audience want to just leave you.

, Practice every day. It doesn’t have to be a harsh practice. Let’s say you’ve been practicing hand-stands, then before you eat dinner, as you wait, just practice little by little. When you have free time, practice. Just anywhere around your house. As you walk around, do some moves, keep doing them, keep practicing, because if you practice certain moves a lot, it will become natural.

, Audition for performances! Work hard for it, and make it a good memory. Throw out everything you’ve learned. You can do it individually or with your friends. Put every single move you learned in a song and make a dance! Listen to the audience’s reactions, listen to their advice, and make it better next time! Dancing on stages will encourage you A LOT. Be proud of your work, but do not let go, keep working until you reach your goal!

Clear a space to dance.,
Invite friends over to learn with you.,
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Take breaks and drink water.",How to Learn Hip Hop Dancing Online3," Find a room in your home or wherever you plan to learn and practice your hip hop moves that will give you plenty of space to move around. Set up a laptop, computer, or internet-enabled TV where you can easily see the screen to follow along with videos.


Be prepared to move backwards, forwards, and side to side in your space, as well as be able to spin and have your arms outstretched without bumping into anything. Clear small furniture or other items that could get knocked, broken, or trip you.
If possible, use a remote to pause, play, and rewind your online tutorials. This will make it easier to learn at your own pace without returning to your device every time you need to control the playback. Try using a cell phone app that can function like a remote., Ask friends or family to join you so you can learn hip hop together. This can help you stay committed to practicing, or simply have more fun with it!


Try scheduling the same time each week for your hip hop practice. You could rotate among friends’ houses each week, or come up with a common meeting spot that’s big enough for the group to dance in.
Make learning a team effort by having each person come up with a new video to learn from each week, or a new style to try.

, Make sure you are wearing clothing and shoes that are comfortable and easy to move in before you begin hip hop dancing. Opt for loose, casual clothing and sneakers with good arch support for your feet.Keep in mind that hip hop dancing is a physical workout, and you will likely be hot and sweating by the time you’re done practicing moves. Wear cooling clothes, have a fan on nearby, and keep a towel on hand to wipe away sweat.
If you have long hair, consider pulling it back or up so it’s out of your face while you’re moving and watching videos, which will also help keep you cooler. Hip hop doesn’t require a certain hairstyle, like a dance style like ballet might, so it’s up to you to choose what will be most comfortable for you.

, Remember that hip hop dancing is a strenuous activity, and you need to take care of your body as you would with any other dance or workout session. Take frequent breaks to rest and drink water while you practice.


Keep a water bottle with water or an electrolyte sports drink nearby so you have it available whenever you need a break. Try to take a break every half hour or hour, or more frequently if you need to.
At the end of a practice session, you should take care of the muscles you worked by stretching as well as drinking water. A good dance tutorial should include warm up and cool down stretches, but if not, try searching for a video that leads you through some simple stretches for dancers."
"
Learn a full choreography.,
Perform for family and friends.,
Continue practicing outside your home.",How to Learn Hip Hop Dancing Online4," Put all the moves you’ve learned to use and tackle the choreography for a whole song. Try a popular dance or song and look for choreography tutorials for it online.


Try searching for a step by step video that breaks down each part of a full choreographed dance, just like you did with learning the basics. While you might be able to pick up a dance from watching a music video or other performance, it’s much easier to grasp it when the steps are taught individually.
You can also make up your own choreography to your favorite song using the hip hop dance moves you have learned if you feel confident to do so!

, Gather family or friends for a small informal performance. Show them the choreography you learned, or some of the individual moves you like best.


You can even use your new skills to teach other friends or family members some of your moves. It can be fun to pass on a new skill, and it can also help you get better just by teaching others.
Performing for a casual group of people you know is also a great way to get used to having an audience if you think you might like to perform in public in the future.

, Keep up with the skills you learned online by finding ways to participate in hip hop dance in new places and with new people. Join a class, take a private lesson, or just dance at clubs and parties to continue honing your skills.


Look for a club, dancehall, or other venue that plays hip hop music on a regular basis. Make sure you are of age for the venue, bring some friends, and use it as an opportunity to practice dancing and even pick up some new moves from other dancers there.
Consider joining a dance crew or another small street dance group. You can even consider performing with a group on the street in areas where it’s allowed in your city.

",How to Improve Your Monologue2," About once or twice should work. Make sure you pick out your monologue way ahead of the audition, and you should be ready to be off book(not looking at the words) by about 2 weeks in advance.

, Fewer for shorter monologues, more for longer monologues. Then try to memorize it by each individual part. Memorizing 2 sentences a day could be a lot easier than 10 sentences a day. As you progress start linking the parts together.

, Watching yourself say it can help you memorize it faster. Kind of like that one movie you watch where you can quote just about the entire movie, because you have watched it so many times.

, If you tell yourself that you can't memorize it in time, will make your body naturally stop trying. If you tell yourself to work harder, you will get it done. Speaking this sentence out loud ""I can memorize this whole thing before my audition"" 3 times will boost your tolerance for memorization.

, Try it with your regular accent first, then research that accent and know that you only have to change a few letter sounds. For example: The doctor hates pears in  a british accent would sound like: Tha Docta hates pehs. But most people would probably make it: Tha Dohctah hahtes pahrs. Remember not to over exaggerate the accent.

, A lot of directors look for movement more than words because it shows expression. don't overdo it but don't under do it either.

, don't show up for an audition dressed in a school uniform if you are auditioning for a rebel. Find what you would think your character would wear. However, if you are required by a dress code to stay in a school uniform, then it is acceptable.

, It could be your friends or parents or just anyone who will lend their ear.

, Notes are advice to improve! Take them! The more developed your scene is the better!

, Before performances and other big acting events, a good way to get rid of being nervous is to shake! Many actors do this to get rid of jitters.

, Try to use your face as much as possible. In a lot of auditions you can't move around so the face is a great way to show emotion.

Feel the beat. You want to be engulfed in the music, so turn it up high enough that you feel every whomp of the kick drum and every thump of the bass.;
, You want your clothes to be loose and comfortable when you're practicing. When you hit the clubs, you may be wearing tighter and less comfortable clothing, but it's good to practice with as much comfort as possible.


Wear shoes that do not grip the floor too hard. You want to be able to slip and spin easily, and if your soles catch on the ground on a fast move, you could fall down, or even twist an ankle.







, You don't want to look stiff when you're dancing hip hop. Look relaxed, with your body comfortable instead of standing up too tall or looking like your head and neck are too stiff. Once your body is relaxed, you're free to move however you want to the beat. If you're too nervous about it, you won't be able to fully let go.

, This is a safe bet for when you're starting to dance to hip hop music. This neutral position will make it easy for you to try any dance move you want to try. Your knees should be slightly bent, which will make it easier for you to dance and will keep you from looking too stiff or formal.

, Don't cross your arms over your chest or fidget with your hands. Just keep your arms and hands nice and loose at your sides, staying relaxed as you start to move to the music.

, When you're dancing hip hop, it's important to get your hips into it. You'll need to move those hips to the right, to the left, to the front, or to the back along with the flow of the music. This can be one of the first things you do as you're getting ready to bust out some killer moves.

, You don't have to follow how other people dance, but know the moves. There's no set way to dance to hip hop music. Your best bet is to relax, move your hips, and to find whatever dance moves feel right to you. You can steal elements of popular dances or make up your own, and mix and match between different moves as much as you like. See the next section to get inspired to do a variety of dance moves.


Remember, it doesn't matter if you look like you know what you're doing. If you act confident and like you do know what's what, then people will have faith in your hip hop dancing skills.







, Learning the whole ""My Dougie"" dance can be helpful in a pinch, if the song comes on, but knowing the main moves in the dance, which require you to move your arms and shoulders from left to right, can also add a nice touch to your dance moves, because you can incorporate a move from this dance into your hip hop moves at any time. You don't have to do the whole dance -- you can just do it for a few seconds before you transition into another move.

, This is another fun dance move that makes it look as if one of your legs doesn't work properly -- hence, the term ""stanky."" Though these moves are part of a dance, you can just do the stanky leg any time. All you've got to do is stick one foot out and lean in the opposite direction, moving the foot that's out in a way that makes it look ""stuck"" or stanky. After a few seconds, you can move to the other side and repeat the move with the other leg.

, Body popping is another classic hip-hop move where you isolate one part of your body at a time, making it ""pop"". You can pop your arms, your shoulders, your chest, or any other part of your body while you're on the dance floor. This is a great move that you can use from time to time without putting too much emphasis on it.

, The Helicopter is a classic break dance move where you squat down on the ground with your hands on the floor and move one leg all the way around your body. To pull this off, you'll have to lift your hands and jump just at the right time, so your feet don't run in to your hands and other leg. This is a great move to do on the dance floor, especially if you're dancing in a circle.

, This dance move looks just like it sounds. First, you pop one part of your body. Then, you lock it all into place. After that, you get low and drop it, with your feet wide. You can do this any time in the middle of any dance move.

, You can learn to do the basic T-step, master the Running Man, or even bring these moves together. The shuffle is a classic move that requires you to have good coordination and nimble feet. If you know how to do it, you'll look like a pro on the dance floor in no time.

, This dance move requires you to bend your knees, move your arms up and down, and cross them behind you. Elements of this dance can be perfect for any hip hop beat.

, Michael Jackson would be proud if he saw you out on the dance floor, busting out his classic move in the middle of a song. All you have to do is master the footwork, making it look like you're moving forward when you're really moving backward. This classic dance move can be done in the middle of any song, even if you only do it for a few seconds.

, Don't be afraid to do this. Although many people are nervous to pull it off, through the years it has become a very universally used hip hop move. If Big Freedia can do it, so can you -- all you've got to do is get comfortable, lean forward, and shake what you've got up and down. Shake from the hips, not the legs. If you really aren't comfortable, it's alright. Hip hop isn't just about twerking.

, Hip hop music is made for grinding. Don't be afraid to grab a partner, sync hips, and grind facing each other and away from each other. If you're not comfortable getting so cozy, you can still keep your distance and have a great time dancing to the music.

, MTV, YouTube, and the internet are all loaded with great music and videos from people of all skill levels. Whether the talent on those videos are world-class poppers or suburban housewives doesn’t matter—–what matters is you watch their moves. Copy what you can, be inspired by what you can’t.


Watch a friend rehearse his or her routine, then practice his or her basic routine. Learn the same stunts and practice the whole routine over again adding the stunts. Then add your own style.







, If you’ve gone far enough on your own, and think you have it, get some lessons. Many dance or even yoga studios offer hip hop dance classes.


Find an inspirational dancer in your neighborhood and ask if he or she gives lessons.
If you don't have the money to take hip hop classes you can learn how to do hip hop through YouTube. This is a cheap way to take hip hop dance without paying for classes.






Check at your local gym. Hip hop dancing is a great way to stay in shape, and it’s fun, too.

, Some people are born to dance. Some have to work at it. It doesn’t matter what group you’re in, what matters is that you work it, and you put yourself into it all the way.


Practice on your own. Dance alone in a room where nobody one can see you, and you won’t worry about what others are thinking—just getting your body comfortable with the beat. Just let your body flow to your own rhythm!

Popping
Locking
The dougie
The stanky leg
The Cupid shuffle;
, You might pull a song from the current top hits list, or you might have something else in mind. The primary feature of hip hop music include: high energy, dance-ability, its lyricism, and use of rapped lyrics.To achieve the best effect in your audience, you should look for these features when searching for the hip hop dance song for your routine.

, Find a peaceful place where you won't be bothered by anyone. Then, on some sort of audio playing device, like your phone or a stereo, play your song. Clear your mind of all things, and consider closing your eyes while you listen to your song. Try to:


Imagine natural movements that accompany features of the song.
Gain a sense of the deeper meaning of the song.
See the story in the music that you want to tell.

, Use how the music makes you feel to generate ideas for your hip hop routine.


Try to express the story of your music using choreography that is easily interpreted by your audience. Even if the dance has meaning for you, if the audience fails to see it, your routine will have less of an impact.

, This can help clarify the natural movements you were trying to gain a sense for while listening to your music. You should also take note, at this time, of space limitations. Precisely measure the dance area or stage you will be using before charting out your choreography.


Try to make use of the entire dance space you have available. Otherwise, it might make your dance seem lacking in fullness or incomplete., Make moves that you believe will have the greatest effect in your audience the central point of your routine.

, Professional dancers usually count out songs by eight counts to help ensure dancers sync with each other and the choreographed dance syncs with the music.Feel the pulse of the beat naturally and count from one to eight throughout the song, making a notation in the lyrics where the first, middle, and last counts fall.

, After you've imagined out your routine and gotten a feel for the music, there are likely a few dominant moves that you feel must be incorporated into your hip hop routine. Use these as a focal point. Distribute these moves throughout your song at appropriate places, and then come up with transitions that work into or out of your main moves.Use the transitions between moves to build or release tension.
Coordinate your main moves with your counts so that you clearly know where in the song your dancers are performing specific moves.

, It's a lot easier to sit down and write ideas, but at some point your dancers are probably going to need a place in the routine to catch their breath.


Insert pauses or slower parts of your routine between, before, or after high energy parts of your choreography so your dancers aren't left gasping.

, Now that you have a fairly full image of the story you're trying to tell through the motions of you choreography, the main choreographic moves you want to hit, and the transitions linking these together, you'll need to write it all down.


Be sure you include counts so that you can coordinate choreography practice and the moves being practiced more easily.

, Tight or constrictive clothing can limit your range of motion, make it difficult for you to engage your whole body while dancing, and can tear during practice. Make sure you have practice clothing that is suitably stretchy and comfortable.

, Stretching has an added bonus for dancers in that it also improves flexibility. Many advanced dance moves, and maybe even some in your choreographed routine, require some measure of flexibility, so be sure you have your dancers warm up before practice., If you have multiple groups that will be doing different things, teach each group individually to prevent confusion. Have your dancers start at an individual level; some will take longer than others to master certain moves.


Once the move is mastered, direct your talent to practice the move together to begin practicing being in sync.

, Many routines require complicated movement among dancers, sometimes at a fast pace, or even at a leap! To keep your dancers from knocking heads, make sure each knows the positions they will occupy on the floor, also known as blocking, before putting the whole routine together.

, Keep a sharp eye the first few times you watch your dancers perform the routine completely. Try to identify weak points, areas the message of your dance is unclear or inexpressive, and moves your dancers are struggling with. Also note ways you might polish the process.


You should also have a dress rehearsal before the main event. Some costumes, no matter how perfect for you routine, will not be suitable to dance in.

Make sure you are capable of physical activity for at least 20 minutes when you start.,
Choose hip hop classes that are at least 30 minutes long.,
Rent a hip hop fitness video, if you would rather have a more private setting.,
Go onto YouTube and stream a hip hop dance routine.",How to Build Stamina With Hip Hop Fitness Moves1," You can prepare by walking, jogging and swimming. You should also prepare flexibility with yoga or simple stretches.


Hip hop improves your cardiovascular, or aerobic, stamina because it moves quickly, requiring oxygen and increasing your heart rate. Taking these precautions will help to reduce your risk of injury and ensure that you are able to build stamina safely.
Hip hop also improves your anaerobic fitness because it requires more than just oxygen. It strengthens your gluteal, abdominal, thigh, hip and other muscles with increased activity. If you feel as though your muscles are burning, they are using chemical stores required to keep up with the strenuous activity.;
, These are given regularly through adult education classes or at gyms. Choose an introductory class, if you have no prior experience with hip hop.

, You may feel more comfortable trying your hardest if you can do the moves at home and learn them at your own pace. You can choose to buy, rent, or stream hip hop fitness videos on Netflix or Amazon.

, This is a great way to learn a whole routine. You can stop it and start it as you learn, and then repeat the routine over and over for endurance training.

"
"
Learn the moves in slow motion.,
Speed up your moves.,
Learn an entire routine and repeat it.,
Dance for 30 minutes to 1 hour 3 times per week.,
Join an intermediate dance class or buy an intermediate DVD once you have mastered the beginning level.,
Join an advanced class if you can dance for an hour.",How to Build Stamina With Hip Hop Fitness Moves2," Many hip hop moves require coordinated feet, leg, arm and head movements. Repeat each move 50 to 100 times, until you feel you have the coordination to speed up.


If you need more time than the instructor is giving you, pause your DVD or computer, or ask the instructor to take a little extra time to work with you. If you are uncomfortable, you can stand in the back until you have picked up the coordination and stamina you need to work through a routine.

, Do the same move quickly 20 to 50 times before moving onto the next move.

, The more times you repeat the dance, the better your moves will be and the more endurance you will gain. Try to dance for at least 30 minutes at 1 time, and then work your way to 45 minutes to an hour.

, Hip hop fitness training should be mixed in with other workouts or with resting days. However, it is essential to train 2 to 3 times per week to increase your stamina in a noticeable way.


It is important to remember that even if you cannot devote 2 to 3 times per week to hip hop fitness, any cardiovascular exercise is helpful to your body. It increases your lung capacity and lowers your risk of heart disease and diabetes.

, Once you feel confident that you have enough stamina and coordination to dance for at least 30 minutes in succession, you will be qualified and enjoy an intermediate class.

, This means you have developed considerable stamina. You have improved your fitness, and you are likely to be able to do other cardiovascular exercise for longer periods of time as well.

",How to Prepare for an Audition," Write it all down if you must. You can never be too prepared! Keep these key points in mind:


When is it?
Where is it? Get the address and postcode of the building, floor number, room number. If it's in an unfamiliar city, consider a dummy run to time the journey and find parking spaces/ bus links.
What is the audition for? Research all you can about the company, production of the show. Not only will this give you a better picture of what they'll be looking for, it shows interest and keenness.
What exactly will the audition entail? Will there be an audience or just a panel? One single audition or several different sections?
What you're required to bring or wear. You may be asked to bring head shots, sheet music, history of theater experience or copies of your prepared monologues.;
, Allow friends, relatives or colleagues to watch your performance prior to your audition. Like knitting or baking, performing is a skill that takes a lot of practice. The more often you perform, the less nervous you will be each time and honest, constructive criticism is gold-dust. Perform to many different types of people- experts and amateurs. The more advice, the better.

,


Is there a time limit? Strictly time your performance leaving some breathing space. Remember that nerves will normally speed up the performance.
Is there a dress code? Even if there is, you have to look your best.
Do you need to submit accompaniments for the pianist in advance or on the day? Do you need to provide the panel with copies of your scores or monologues?
Are you expected to bring a CV/resume, proof of identity or examination/qualification certificates?

, If you can, get a script, and learn the lines of the character you're wanting, or just look though the script.


Actors: research the material and familiarize yourself with it. If you are auditioning for a specific character, spend time thinking about their characteristics and their role in the play.
Singers: Ensure you can confidently perform scales, vocal exercises and that you have a personal routine to warm up your voice. Be aware that you may need to warm up 'publicly', meaning that there will rarely be a private practice space to warm up. Don't let this intimidate you. Make sure you know your specific vocal range, voice type and fach. Be prepared to answer questions about your preferred style and part.
All Region Band Tryouts: Make sure that the music is well practiced. The only thing you can do for the audition is to make sure that you prepare your music to the best of your ability. Warm up, and make sure that your instrument is swabbed, oiled, or cleaned prior.

, Get to bed early in order to be well-rested for the day ahead.

, Avoid acidic or greasy foods, fizzy drinks,chocolate and coffee as these damage your vocal chords and make it harder to be at your best. If you are a smoker, do your best to put your morning cigarette off until after your audition, especially if you will be singing.

, Also, if you are unfamiliar with the area where the audition will be held, allow time in your schedule to make sure you won't arrive late.

, When you arrive, there may be a large crowd of people, but it's perfectly normal to be nervous. Just remember all the hard work you have put into preparing for your audition and walk in smiling with your head held high.

, You may not hear immediately whether or not your audition was successful. It can take days or weeks.
Try not to over-analyse. You never know what exactly they were looking for- you've done your best and it's all you can do.
Stay focused and determined. You won't get every part you audition for and this is normal! Remember that each audition you do is strengthening you as a performer and thickening your skin.

Be prepared by learning as much as you can about the part you are auditioning for.,
Make sure that you are qualified for the role as well as the position as an actor.,
Ensure that your resume and head shot are professionally produced and up-to-date.,
Continue to build upon your experience and resume so that you have more to offer as an experienced actor because auditions are similar to job interviews.,

Don't allow your wardrobe to steal the show.,
Be confident when you enter the audition room, but don't allow yourself to become arrogant.,
Demonstrate an interest in the part by asking a few questions.,
Strive to leave a positive impression without trying to shock the casting directors or beg for the role.",How to Treat Acting Auditions Like Job Interviews," Just like a job interview, you are applying for a specific position so you want to make sure that you are able to fill the part accordingly. Equally, you should also learn as much as you can about the casting company you are auditioning for.;
, If necessary, brush up on your skills while you continue to search for work by attending acting workshops.

, As with a regular job interview, a resume gives a brief explanation of your talents and experience, and it should entice an employer, creating the desire to learn more.

, This means taking part in local productions and smaller acting parts.

, You want some time to read through the reading and establish the manner in which you will perform it.

, Auditions are like job interviews and you don't have to dress in costume or an obnoxious outfit in the hopes of leaving an impression. Doing so may instead be a distraction and defeat the purpose of the casting crew focusing on your ability to act.

, With auditions and job interviews alike, you want to demonstrate that you can do the job, not exhibit that you are full of hot air.

, Just don't overdo it as this can be annoying and turn the casting crew off. The idea is that you want them to recognize that you are eager to give them what they want and that you can be directed easily.

, Just like an interview you have the opportunity to show the casting directors that you are capable of performing a part.

Make sure you want to participate in a singing audition.,
Gather the courage and confidence, if you don't have enough as is.,
Choose a song, if you don't have one picked yet.,
Learn and memorize the lyrics.,
Before you walk in, picture what you're going to do and say.",How to Prepare for a Singing Audition," The main problem with auditioning to sing is people can sometimes be ill-suited to performing to large crowds. Ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly: Can I actually sing? Do I have or can I get the courage to perform in front of people? Do I want to do this? If you answered 'yes' to most of these, then you can pull this off.;
, Tell yourself you can do this. Get encouragement from friends and family, as well as practice singing in front of them.


Have you got stage fright? Remember, you are a good singer. People should like your singing, and if they don't, this isn't about what they think of you. It's about singing. Remember that you are good, but also not everybody will like your singing. Take deep breaths, hum the tune a bit, clear your throat a few times, and walk into your audition with a straight back, your head held high, and a big smile. Introduce yourself politely and clearly, and don't forget to look at your audience and smile. Just imagine you are rehearsing again and forget there is an audience. When your audience has finished, smile, say ""Thank you,"" and walk out of the room with a straight back and your head held high.
When you're talking to the audience, remember these tips:

Dress appropriately. Don't wear anything too glamorous or lazy, but wear well-fitting, sophisticated clothing.
Do not have your arms crossed or hands in front of you. Instead, have them gently clasped behind your back.
When talking, try not to say any ""um's"", ""ah's"", or anything like that. It will make you sound nervous and unprofessional.



, What type of a voice do you have? Ask a relative or friend what style of music (opera, hip hop, pop etc.) they think your voice suits. Give them a sample of your singing for them to judge on. Once you have determined your appropriate genre, you need to pick a song. Make a list of your favorite songs in that genre. Next, put a star next to the ones that are well known. Use the starred songs as your starting point, and don't be afraid to experiment. If your computer has a microphone, try recording yourself singing to a karaoke version on a video. Play it back and see which song suits your voice best.

, If this is a favorite song of yours, then you may even know the words already. But it is still a good idea to double-check them. Listen to the original song a few times and then try to write down as much of the lyrics from memory as you can. Check them by listening again and change them if there are any errors. Sing them off the sheet you wrote whilst listening to the song a couple of times, and then try without the sheet. You may have to do this several times, checking each time, before you are comfortable that you have remembered the right words. Now, sing them off the sheet with an instrumental (karaoke) version of the song. Try it without the words again, still on the instrumental. Listen to the instrumental on its own, singing in your head.

, Stay calm, and prepare yourself!

Make a note of the date.,
Don't over practice in the lead up to your audition.,
Try to find out what to expect in your audition.,
If you are expected to do orchestral excerpts, don't forget to prepare them.,

If you are going to have an interview, prepare some answers in advance.,
Make sure you get a good nights sleep the night before.,
Eat a good breakfast.,

Don't over practice.,
Remember to just do your best and don't worry about the outcome.,
Make yourself appear confident to the panel, even if you don't feel confident.,
Say thank you when you leave.,
Don't dwell on your audition after it's finished.",How to Prepare for an Audition (Musicians)," When you find out your audition date, write it on a calendar and work out how long you have to prepare yourself. This will help you to feel more prepared and in control of the situation. It will also help to make sure that you don't forget when it is and suddenly realize that it is in just a few days time (not a good situation!).;
, Over-practicing can lead to making you more nervous and less confident for your audition. The ideal is to continue practicing as you have been doing already, and slowly build up the amount of time spent practicing.


For example, practice for an extra 10 minutes each day and then within a week you will be doing more than an hour more than you had been the previous week.

, This will help you get an idea of what is expected of you, allowing you to prepare and impress the panel.


See if you can find anything on the internet about the audition process for where you are auditioning.
Try to find someone who has auditioned for the same place before. Ask them what happened and how they prepared.

, Orchestral excerpts are often an important part of an audition for an orchestra place. They will assess how well you are playing them and how well you have prepared for them. They will want to know that who they choose has the time (and inclination) to practice orchestra parts as well as solo pieces.


Preparation is key. It helps to listen to recordings of the pieces your excerpts are from. It will allow you to get an idea of how it is usually played in an orchestra, which allows you to use aspects such as dynamics. Moreover, you will know what has happened before and after your excerpt, allowing you to add the feeling that you would use if you were playing the whole thing.
Choose a piece that you know well and are comfortable with. Avoid trying to impress by pushing yourself. The idea is to nail your audition; don't give even the slightest impression that you're trying too hard. Always have back up pieces ready. It's not unusual to be asked to play something else and you need to be ready.

, The feeling of turning up for an audition and realising that you are supposed to be doing aural tests when you haven't done any aural in months is not a good feeling! If you're not sure, either find out in advance, or practice them a little just in case––it's better to be too prepared than not prepared enough in aspects such as this.

, If you make sure you have some answers ready, it's harder for the judges to catch you out; it will also help to make you seem more confident, leaving a good impression with the panel.


If you can talk to anyone who has auditioned there in the past, ask them what sort of questions to expect. This will help you be more prepared and confident.

, Sleep will help if you're nervous. Don't let nerves keep you up all night as this will not help you in your audition.

, Breakfast gives you energy for the rest of the morning; this is important for practicing in the morning and for your audition.


Bananas are both filling and help target nervousness. There is a chemical in bananas which helps you feel less nervous so this could be an ideal breakfast.If you don't like bananas, apparently chocolate has a similar effect.,


Find out what time you have to be at your audition. Work out your expected journey length and therefore what time you have to leave. If you are traveling by bus or car, leave extra time in case of traffic, check online for train delays or cancellations or, if you're traveling by car or bus, check online for traffic on your route. Plan your morning around the time you have to leave.
It is good to arrive at an audition a little earlier than they are expecting you. Say your audition is at 11:30am but you get 15 minutes to practice before it. They are expecting you to arrive at 11:15, then you should probably aim to arrive by no later than 11:10, if possible. Therefore, if you expect the journey to take 25 minutes and you decide to allow 10 minutes for traffic, you would be leaving home at 10:35.

, In your warm up time, it is helpful to not spend the whole of your warm up time practicing your audition material. Maybe start by playing slow scales or a study to help keep your mind off of the audition. It might sound stupid but it helps to not think about the audition before you go in. If you think about it too much, you might begin to panic and over think it, it's best to stay calm.

, Liken the audition to a private performance you're giving to a few people. This will help you stay calm.


Ways to help yourself stay calm include things such as breathing exercises, thinking about other things and resorting to any of your own methods that you've developed over time.

, Walk in very confidently, give them a smile and maybe have a little chat if they initiate conversation (not too much, or for too long though, and stay on the topic of music and your audition if you do).


If they ask you anything, answer calmly and collectedly, don't answer too quickly, as this can make you seem nervous but don't take too long or it will make you seem under-prepared and disorganized.

, It will leave a good impression.

, There is no point at all dwelling on your audition. No matter how much you overthink it and overanalyze your performance, you can't change it now.


Don't overanalyze, it will make you feel bad about yourself - after all, the panel probably didn't even notice that wrong note in bar 40.

, that you LOVE and that relates somehow to you.


If you choose a piece you are not passionate about, it shows. There is a visible lack luster to your performance and auditioners see it very clearly. It makes it hard to get into or develop character because you don't really want to: you're not that invested.
Choose something that you find truth in. If you are a woman/girl, do not choose a male monologue, male song, male anything, and vice versa. Choose something in your age range. Don't choose a piece with a 40-70 year old character when you're 23. It makes no sense and majorly distracts from what you are trying to create: the illusion of another person distracting from your own person. Accents are discouraged (unless absolutely necessary). The best thing you can do for yourself is find certain personality traits or experiences that reflect or are true to some of your own.
This also applies to a piece you've already chosen: if you've picked it correctly and for the right reasons, as you explore the character, find things that you can relate to. Maybe it is determined that your character is shy or insecure; if you find any of these things in yourself than bring it to the table. It can even work that maybe the character is insecure about his/her appearance and you're insecure about your voice, you can still bring the same body language and internal monologue just centered around a different physical focal point.
When you choose a monologue, read the play it's from. When you choose a song, read the musical and listen to all the songs. Know the story, what happened before the piece and why you are doing the piece, what do you have to gain, and how is what you are doing going to get you what you want.

, like it's been a part of your life for years. You will feel so much better knowing that when the pressure's on, the lines will be there for you. Don't have a lot of time? Recite your monologues in the shower or on the way to work or school. Sing your song in the shower and put it on your iPod so that even when it's not appropriate to sing. you're still familiarizing yourself with the lyrics and timing. Preparation allows you to create a character effectively and stay calm and concentrated in the high-stress environment of an audition room.

, You're already there, there's no amount of last minute preparation that can help you now, you've learned the lines, lyrics, explored the character, all of the things you need to do. Try to take deep breaths and don't worry about what will happen, because what will happen will happen and worrying about it actually makes things worse. Drink some water, think about your lines, walk around a little but don't psyche yourself out.

, Don't let your nerves get the best of you and force you into a jittery mumbling mess. When you get into the room, take a deep breath and say ""Hi, how are you?"". Address those auditioning calmly. Be polite and friendly and a really nice person to witness even before you start any performing.

, Enjoy what you do during an audition, because if you don't then acting is not for you. You don't have to love auditioning itself, but you should the work once you get it. Really get into what you're doing because there is no second chance, you have to show them the peak of your talent and your most vibrant side so go all out.

Find a place large enough to hold the audition.,
Get the equipment you require.,
Decide whether you are going to hold 'open' or 'set' auditions.,
Make your advertisements.,
Set an exact time limit on a person's performance and make sure they know this before they come.

,
If they are auditioning for a part in a film or play, provide them with a script as soon as they decide that they would like to audition.

,
Create forms for when people arrive.,
Try to accept every person that rings for an audition, even if they can't make in on your assigned day.,
Get together a panel of interviewers, and a few people to organise queues etc, if holding a large audition.,
Get the organisers to make a few refreshments for the people auditioning, this shows you care!

,Make sure the place where the people are auditioning is separate from the people waiting to interview, this helps calm nerves and will make it more fair

,
Always give constructive criticism if you have any but don't be mean.,
Once the auditions are over, make your decisions and inform the person you've accepted first, then ring/email each person saying that you're sorry but that you'll keep their form in case another opening becomes available.

",How to Hold an Audition," If you are only expecting 20 or 30 people for an audition, even your garage may do. If you need a larger space, try renting out hotels or venues function rooms. These often are quite cheap to rent during the day, which is the most likely time to hold your auditions.;
,


If you're auditioning people to become members of a band, you may need to supply amps, leads, microphones etc. If you need a drummer for a band, you will most certainly need to have a drum kit available. Not many drummers will cart their expensive kits to an audition. Other instruments won't be necessary as most people will only play their own instruments
If you're auditioning an actor or singer for a musical, you may need microphones also, and a stereo or PA to play music through. But more importantly you may need someone to play out parts with them. This should not be too difficult to organise if you are in charge of hiring people!

,


Open Auditions are where you have a start time for auditions and anyone can turn up. This is done on a first come first serve basis.
Set Auditions are where you do not list the time or location of your auditions on your advertisements. You just put a contact number up, and when people ring you, you give them more information and a specific time and date for their audition. Though this sounds more complicated, this is often easier and seems better organised. Also, you know how many people are going to show up before they arrive.
Posters should follow this guide:
AUDITIONS
What type(s) of performer is required
Age and sex requirements
Time and Date (optional)
Length of audition
Contact number, website and email



, If you're not artistic/confident enough to make your own get them professionally done. Posters put up in venues, music shops, colleges and schools, drama clubs etc. are often the most effective. But there's no harm in placing advertisements in local papers. Another way to guarantee auditions is to ring Talent Agencies and Agents which can be found in your Yellow Pages. Only good performers are picked up by these businesses. Make sure to be safe about where you decide to put up your advertisements.

,,, Also ask them to bring passport style, photos so when you're debating which to accept afterwards you will remember every person. This form should have:




Name
Phone Number
Address
Email Address
Age



, Often the most talented are the busiest! So try to accommodate them in a separate/private audition.

, The panel should always consist of at least two people, at least one man and one woman, unless you are running an all male or all female band. This looks more professional and one on one auditions can be disconcerting.

,,, Don't give away your decision either and tell every person auditioning that you'll get back to them.

Inquire about the dance audition requirements.,
Bring a headshot.,
Prepare a dance resume.,
Create a dance solo.,
Dress in appropriate dance attire for the dance audition.,
Arrive early for the dance audition.,
Relax during the dance audition.",How to Prepare for a Dance Audition," A dance choreographer may require that you bring a headshot (professional photograph) and a dance resume. A dance program admissions committee may have collected all information in advance and require that you simply show up in appropriate dance attire.;
, In open call dance auditions, a headshot is sometimes required. A headshot is typically an 8-inch by 10-inch (20.32 cm by 25.4 cm) photograph of the face. In the dance world, however, it is common for dancers to pose for a full-body photograph that highlights their dance strengths or flexibility. Casting directors typically keep the headshot, particularly if they plan to call you back for a second audition.

, Include your name, contact information and a list of dance accomplishments. List the names of the dance schools you attended, any degrees in dance, and the dance productions and companies for which you've performed. Some dance employers also require a description of your hair color, height and weight.

, If the dance audition requires that you perform a dance solo, choreograph it ahead of time.


Choreograph a solo that highlights your strengths as a dancer and a choreographer. If you are trained in several styles of dance, choose a style that is in alignment with the dance program or choreographer's needs. For example, if applying to a ballet school, choreograph a ballet piece rather than hip hop, unless you're confident that dance versatility will be a selling point.

,


Wear a leotard and tights. If auditioning for a ballet, jazz or modern dance piece, a leotard and tights are standard attire. More conservative schools prefer distinct colors, for example black leotards, so inquire about these specifics ahead of time.
Bring the right dance shoes. Wear ballet slippers for a ballet class and pointe shoes if you will perform advanced ballet movements. Bring tap shoes to a tap audition. Jazz auditions typically require jazz shoes. A modern or contemporary audition is usually performed in bare feet. For hip hop, wear athletic shoes.

, To ease any nervousness, give yourself enough time to find the audition location and to get warmed up.


Warm up before the audition begins. Avoid auditioning with cold muscles. As soon as you arrive at the audition location, find a spot for warm-up purposes. Once your muscles are warm, stretch them so that you are as flexible as possible.

, It's normal to feel nervous during an audition, particularly if you're auditioning for a highly sought after dance job or slot in a dance school. More than likely, you'll be taught a dance routine on the spot and asked to learn it quickly and perform it, either as a solo or in a group. The more relaxed you are, the easier it will be to rely on your natural talent and dance training to impress the dance judges.

Make sure that you are familiar with the play and character(s) that you are auditioning for.,
Go to the website or email the director to find out how long your monologue needs to be.,
Try searching for monologues on Google, making sure that you type theatre as well as most directors do not like to see a monologue from a movie or TV show and especially not one from a book.,
Surf through appropriate monologues, reading them aloud to yourself as you go to make sure that you like the feel of the monologue and tab 2 - 4 that you like the best.

,
Look up the plays to which the monologues belong so that you know what each is talking about, and read through the monologues a couple times and try to put emotion into them.,

, You can also order a book of theatre monologues from the library.

,, From there, think about which one you like the best and which goes the most with the character and play that you are auditioning for.

, Perhaps you'll end up finding a deeper meaning along the way.

, Make sure that these movements are not overly choreographed but not too choppy either. Make them natural and fitting for your monologue.

, Scripts are important. They allow you to get into character, and practice the lines. They also present you with character options. You can check simplyscripts.com or ask the casting director. Sometimes the director gives scripts or part of the script to all interested in auditioning.

, Read it and practice in front of a mirror. Practice by yourself first, and see what characters you are interested in.

, This is important because they can provide you with criticism and things you did good. Please be aware that they are not pros.

If you get into the show, you will have to give up a lot of your personal time. Moreover, dropping out is simply not an option, as you'll be letting down the rest of the cast. Be absolutely certain this is the right choice for you at this point in time.;
, You won't be able to get a lead or supporting role if you don't have self confidence. To build up your self confidence, recognize your flaws and insecurities and learn to love them because they are a part of you. Start feeling good about yourself. A good actor/actress only needs to please herself/himself.

, If there's a movie based on it, watch it. If there's a soundtrack, listen to it. Read the book it's based on too, if applicable. Know what the characters are all about and know which one of the lead characters you want to play.


Go online, and look for scripts, you can even watch a little bit on Youtube, if you find the play or musical.

, As soon as you walk into the first audition, you've already started your audition. Practice demonstrating good posture and volunteer in exercises.

, You will need to know when and where the audition will be taking place. Sometimes nerves can do funny things to you and cause you to get lost, so also know exactly how to get to the place where the audition is being held.

, You may be able to choose it yourself but normally it's a set piece, maybe an extract from the script.

, On the day of the audition, be on time or perhaps even 10 minutes early. If waiting near other people auditioning bothers you, at least be at the building and find your own quiet corner away from the others.

, Before you sing your audition piece, warm up your vocal chords.

, If you're asked to sing any random song for the audition, don't sing overused songs. The director has probably listening to these songs all day and if you sing it too, they'll probably skip over you. Also never sing a song in the play! That's basically audition suicide. It just shows you are really desperate for the character who sings that songs role.

, Speak loudly and clearly, the director needs to know how loud you can be. You're never too loud in theatre.


Also walk in with the attitude of your character you would like to play. If you are auditioning for the villain you can walk in with a mysterious look.

, Suggest the character you want to play in your dress (i.e. if you were trying out for Sharpay in High School Musical you might want to wear bright pink.) This helps the director(s) see you as that character. But don't overdo it! Full costumes are usually not appropriate for auditions. Also, too much may give you a slight reputation of being desperate or needy.

, Most acting auditions are cold readings. So when given a scene to audition with, look it over until you almost have it memorized. If you're doing a scene with another person, talk to them to help your chemistry on stage. Take the script pages you have to read out of the script, if possible, so that your body is given more freedom to act.


When reading, hold the pages away from your face, so your words don't get blocked out by having something in front of your face. Don't forget to look at the person you are reading with. Get into the character you are reading.
Whilst others are auditioning make sure you are reading your audition piece. Look at the people auditioning and see what people like and what they don't like so much.

, If you are seen distracting others or being disrespectful, the directors won't want you in their production. Directors look for things off stage too, if you're quiet in your seat, how you react to certain things, and lots more, so be on your best behavior.

, No matter how nervous you are, never show it. The director wants someone who is not afraid to be big and out going in front of an audience that can act.

, Even if you don't get a lead, which you will if you've followed these steps, be a good sport about the role you did get. ""There's never small parts, just small actors!"" If you have a good attitude and do your best with the part you get, the director will remember. In the future, he or she might give you a bigger role.


Even if you don't get the part that you wanted, congratulate the person who got the part you wanted. It shows that you are a nice person.
Don't worry if you don't get a main part, they'll want to see how well you do with a smaller part first. This is especially true if this is your first performance.

Get an audition piece as soon as they are available.,
Memorize the piece.,

Practice, practice, practice.,
When the day of the audition comes, be calm.,
During the audition, don't look directly at the audience unless your part requires you to.,
Deliver your lines as clearly as possible.,
Walk offstage with dignity.",How to Get a Part in a School Play when You're Shy," You'll want to get as comfortable as you can with the piece(s) before the audition. Two weeks is good enough for someone who's experienced in memorizing; three is better if this is your first time. Sometimes there is a choice of pieces to choose from, sometimes you will have to find your own. Make sure that for whatever play it is, you will enjoy being more than one character just in case.;
, It's the foundation of your audition. You can't act if you have the script in your hand, so why the audition piece? If you know your part by heart, it'll be a lot easier to act it out on stage, as you won't be nervous about the specifics. Make copies and have them at places around the house, or in your pocket, so if you have nothing to do, you can practice. Also remember to be able to say it in your sleep, the more you say it the easier it comes out.

, If the play you're auditioning for is a classical play written in verse or an older form of English (Shakespeare or non-contemporary writers), it can be difficult to actually know what you're talking about; find someone who understands the piece(a teacher, for example) and/or look up words you don't know in dictionaries. Understanding the piece will also aid in getting into character. Never say a line that you don't understand, as you will end up giving the director a reason to reject you.

, It's not just an old adage; it works, especially in the theater. If you get in, you're going to have to rehearse anyway, right? You may as well get used to it. The more you practice, the easier it will come on the day of the audition. Rehearse for friends and family, and make sure that they give feedback.

, Butterflies in your stomach are normal, but don't let nervousness take control. Take deep breaths. Meditate. Do yoga. You can check this article for more ways of relaxing. If you have memorized correctly, then don't even think about your piece before you go up. If your school auditions where everyone sits together, then just ignore your part and get absorbed into the others pieces, enjoy where you are. If you are stressing about you audition, then you won't be able to see what the director doesn't like from other people to make quick changes.

, Focus on a point past everybody's head(something on the wall, for example) and use that as your line of sight. Remember, as a character, you're not supposed to see the audience. If it is dramatic, look at things such as exit signs or a light booth in the back and stare at something, particularly only stare at that. Dramatic pieces can also work for sitting in a vulnerable position with your knees toward each other and slightly slouched over. Comedic auditions, you should usually move around just a little bit to look more inviting.

, It will play against you if all the audition hears is mumbling. Keep your head up, your shoulders back, and speak in a clear, louder-than-normal voice. Enunciate and work on breath control. If you can't control your voice out of pressure, then you can't control it during pressure.

, Keep your head high and don't mumble to yourself about how you sucked, or how you were awesome. Stay into character until you're back into your seat. No matter what, act as if you were the most amazing person that ever walked onto that stage. Acting is about taking on a character and acting as someone else.

, When it's not your turn to audition, flash at the director. If you're going to be in the drama club, you're going to need to be comfortable on the stage. Smiling and speaking loudly are both ways to show that you are likely to not have a panic attack during a performance, which is something that most directors prefer to occur.

, When you audition, try to move around a little bit. No matter how tiny the area that you are given to work with is, you always look better if you can demonstrate some basic knowledge of blocking (a stage term for where you stand/move).

, Stepping inside another person's skill is an absolute requirement when performing drama. Think to yourself:


How would ____ (the character you are auditioning for) talk?
How would he/she move?
How would he/she react to things?


Don't overdo it. The person you are still needs to shine forth; switch back to your real self in the blink of an eye when needed, showing that you're not lost in the character. Actors who lack this ability during the early stages of training can be a warning sign to a judge, who may be concerned that you'll be difficult to work with or lost in daydreams.







, When you are finished, stand up smiling; the director will eventually give you further instructions."

Make sure you have a water bottle.",How to Do Well at an Audition," If your character is bubbly, then act bubbly at the audition. If your character is silly, act silly at the audition. Make sure you know what the play is about,because if you do a cold reading, you want to know what the scene is about.;
, Do it in front of your friends and family and ask them honestly what they think. Practice what you will be singing, acting, or dancing. If you are at a musical audition, you will probably have to sing a song. Try to have one prepared from a different musical or play. Perhaps one that is in your key range.

, Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers because most likely, you will have to dance, stretch and simply feel OK in what you're wearing.

,, Most people auditioning will be just as nervous as you are.

, (This is good for acting practice as well). Do it in front of the mirror. Walk with good posture - shoulders back head a bit high - and give a big smile to the judges.

, Tell them your name and a bit about you. Try being friendly and tell them what plays or drama you've got involved in before.

, It will be very nerve racking, but just relax. Tell yourself that the worst thing that can happen is you'll get rejected and then you'll probably never see them again, and even though that's worst, it's not even terrible.

, That is what the judges are looking for, after all.

, Odds are you will want to clear your throat before you sing. When anyone asks you a question, speak loudly and clearly. While singing, open your mouth wide and try to smile as you sing.

Read books, magazines, or news articles out loud on a regular basis to get more comfortable with it. Spend a minimum of 30 minutes a day reading out loud. Practice enunciating words and work on your intonation. Try changing the sound of your voice as you read for an added challenge.Practice reading a variety of material to improve your voice. You could start with Dr. Suess and move on to The Hobbit and then challenge yourself with poetry. It should never sound like you are reading, but should sound like a performance. It is your job to bring these words to life.;
, Try reciting monologues or reading from a script and recording it. Play it back to yourself to hear what you sound like, and make personal notes for improvement. The sound of your own voice might surprise you! The way you sound in a recording isn’t necessarily the same way you sound to yourself each day. Take note of these changes and get used to your recorded voice so that you can effectively express yourself over a microphone., When listening to your voice, consider whether you are using a nasal, mouth, chest, or diaphragm voice. A nasal voice sounds unpleasant and whiny, a mouth voice sounds very quiet, a chest voice sounds pleasant, but a diaphragm voice is the most powerful and has the best sound. To develop the diaphragm voice, practice breathing deeply and watching your stomach rise and fall. Make sounds that come from the diaphragm, such as laughing or yawning. Once you get the hang of it, it is merely a matter of maintaining the voice. A voice teacher can help you project from the diaphragm., Certain exercises can help you to control and improve your voice. Many of them are based on breathing. You could try humming a scale by blowing through a straw for breath control.You could lie on the floor and deeply inhale and exhale, making a “shh” sound while exhaling.Even simply sitting up straight with your shoulders back can make a big difference in the sound of your voice. You could also practice articulating with tongue twisters, such as “Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather.”, Learning to imitate a sound can help you build flexibility, recognize pitch and tone, and give you good material to include on your demo reel. You don’t have to be an impressionist to be a voice artist, but it is helpful to be able to change the sound of your voice. This will allow you to be more versatile and will also help with your acting skills. Try to match not only the person’s voice, but also their personality so that you bring them to life rather than just imitating their sound.Try out these famous voices for starters: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Cosby, Tony the Tiger, Roger Rabbit, Christopher Walken, Don LaFontaine

, Doing improvisation is an important skill in voice acting because directors will expect this of you. This skill will allow you to truly embody a character and think like they do. After you’ve gotten into character, try coming up with a funny story on the spot as that character. If you need help, have a friend ask you questions and respond based on what you think the character would say. For example, if you are doing an impression of Kermit the Frog, you could make up a story about asking Miss Piggy out on a date., This will help you to develop your acting talent. Though voice actors never appear on the screen, they must be extremely talented actors in order to effectively deliver their lines. Remember that in some ways, voice acting is more difficult than other types of acting because you don't have other actors to work off of and the audience can’t see your facial expressions, hand gestures, or movements. You don’t have props or other tools to aid in your delivery. Your full emotions and personality must be expressed solely through your voice.If you are still in school, enroll in the theater program and audition for any plays or one-acts that are being produced. If you aren’t in school, find community theatre productions to participate in., Having regular voice lessons (at least once a week) will help you expand your vocal range and teach you how to better control the volume and sound of your voice. You may need to try several voice teachers to find the best fit for you. A good voice teacher will help you not only develop strong technique and control, but also will help you to find your unique voice.A good voice teacher will help you to warm up your voice well. There are many vocal warmups. You could start by flapping your lips while blowing air and making a “brrr” sound. Then yawn widely and sigh while smiling to stretch your jaw., This is a voice actor's way of showcasing his or her talents when looking for work. Your demo reel can be comprised of original work or imitations of characters/scripts that already exist. It is important to have a quality demo reel that represents you and showcases your range and skill set. You can record your own or have it professionally done. If recording your own, pay attention to sound quality and make sure to do it in a place without background noise. You don’t want anything to distract from your voice.Getting a professional demo reel can cost hundreds of dollars. It doesn’t guarantee a good demo, just a good quality recording. The content of your demo is most important. With a good microphone in a quiet room at home, you can still make a quality recording.
Start strong, with your best work showcased in the first 30 seconds of your reel. A potential employer will likely only watch about 30 seconds of your reel, so make it count. A demo reel should be fairly short, no longer than one to two minutes long, and it should be straight to the point, succinctly showcasing several voices.If you are creating a demo reel for a specific job position that you desire, make sure the content of your demo reel is relevant to the job. For example, if you are auditioning for a male character, they probably don’t need to hear your old lady impression.

, You often need to have work to get work, which can be challenging when starting out. Try to gain any experience you possibly can so that you can build a resume. Take acting classes, attend workshops, make a YouTube channel featuring your original content, get involved in community theater, offer to be the announcer at your school, narrate an ebook, or simply find anything relevant to voice acting that you can do to get started. This will help you to look experienced to casting directors and will help you to develop your skills.Your resume is much more important than headshots for voice acting. Professional headshots are a nice touch, but they can cost hundreds of dollars and don’t help casting directors because your appearance isn’t relevant to voice acting.

, Just like any other kind of actor, a voice actor’s career will be helped by having an agent represent them.Your agent will notify you of casting calls in the area and help match you with the right jobs. They will help to market you and manage your career. They will help negotiate your salary and will earn commission from your jobs. They will know of jobs that you aren’t able to find on your own. Send your demo reel and resume to talent agents in your area. Choose one that you trust and feel comfortable with.Getting an agent will help take your career to the next level. You already need to have your voice developed and determine what kind of voice work you want to do prior to getting an agent.
Find an agent that specializes in voice acting. Decide whether you want to work in television, films, or radio, and find an agent that specializes in that industry.

, Find every studio within your area and mail them your demo and resume. If you are willing to travel, you could even send your demo and resume across the country. Be prepared to wait for an answer and to face a lot of rejection. Studios get hundreds of demos and you may or may not be what they are looking for. Just because they don’t respond right away, however, doesn’t mean they will never be interested. Maybe they don’t have a part for you currently but liked your demo and will consider you in the future., Having a strong online presence can help your career. You can make a personal website using a service such as Wordpress, you can showcase your skills on YouTube, or you can use social media sites by making accounts specifically for your career. Casting directors are looking more and more at the internet to find talent. If someone has heard of your work, you want it to be easy for them to look you up and see what you can do. Having pages online dedicated specifically to your voice work will help you market yourself.

, If you are seriously pursuing voice acting as a career, you may want to live in a city with a large voice acting industry. Although the internet has lessened the necessity of this, it can still be helpful to be right in the center of things. Some of the top cities in the US for voice acting are Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, and San Francisco., Even if you don’t have an agent and haven’t heard from a studio yet, you can still begin to attend auditions by going to open calls. An open call is an audition that anyone can attend. Be prepared for there to be many people at open calls and to be seen for only a short amount of time. Even if it isn’t very likely to book a role at an open call, it is still great practice and will help you get used to auditioning and start getting yourself seen by casting directors.To find open calls in your area, you can look at a website like backstage.com for listings., Since voice acting can be done simply with a microphone, you can even audition from home. There are different job listings online, such as the ones at voices.com. The online marketplace is changing the way casting occurs, and auditioning online is a great option when you don’t live in a major acting city., Some say that the real work of an actor is auditioning. This is because acting is highly competitive. You will likely need to go on many auditions to book just one gig, and then as soon as you complete your job, you have to start auditioning all over again. Therefore, you must learn to embrace the audition process and go to as many as possible. This will keep you sharp and your voice in shape for when you do land a job. The more auditions you attend, the higher chance you have of being hired.Audition even for roles that you aren’t sure you’re right for. You never know what a casting director is looking for.

, Make sure your voice is warmed up and you are hydrated. Make sure you have prepared the script and know how you will read it. Some auditions consist of only saying one line, so it is important to know that you can nail it ahead of time. This will also help to ease your nerves in a stressful audition environment. Have other dialogue prepared besides the script in case casting directors want to see what else you can do.Try to get inside the character’s head and to go beyond the words on the page. Who is this character? What is important to them? Why are they saying these words? It might help you to write down your ideas about a character to work through the important aspects of them. This will help you to bring the character to life.

, When attending an audition, punctuality is key. To ensure your prompt arrival, try to get there 10-15 minutes ahead of time. This will give you a chance to get settled and even go over your script., Even though looks aren’t relevant for voice acting, your overall impression says a lot. Make sure to dress appropriately. Don’t wear an old, raggedy t-shirt. You should look professional and keep in mind what character you are auditioning for.For example, if you’re auditioning for a ninja, you don’t need to wear a costume, but wearing a black button-down shirt would be a good way to interpret that role with professional clothing.

Have your outfit hint at a certain part or character you want.,
Don't overload on the makeup and hair.",How to Dress for an Audition1," Don't dress to look exactly like the character, but choose a few colors that might resemble the part you want.;
, If you want a role that has a green skin color and hair that sticks straight up, don't do the same with your makeup and hair. Imply that character with some possible green eye-shadow; This will make you look way more professional to the directors, which might land you the part!

"
"
Don't wear anything too fancy.,
Wear something that's fitted, but not too tight.,
If you are auditioning for a major role, wear something similar to your character's costume, but don't wear their exact costume, that comes off an unprofessional and just stupid.

,
Be yourself!,
Girls: Wear make-up, but pay attention to your character.,
If you are imitating another person, shift into a different voice.

,
Wear your hair either in a high ponytail or down.,
Boys, just have your hair natural.

,
Smile!,
Wear bright, happy colors unless you are auditioning for a dark, evil, villain.

,
Girls, carry a purse and don't wear silly bandz and put your phone in your pocket and make sure they can't see it.

,
Wear shoes you can move comfortably in, but stay professional.,
DO NOT wear sunglasses unless your role has them.

,
Don't audition for a part that does not fit you, for example, if you are 11, don't audition for a 17 year old part.

",How to Dress for a Hollywood Film Audition," Instead, wear something nice, but not fancy.;
, You want the casting director to see your shape, but not every lump or roll.

,, But don't act immaturely.

, If you're going for an innocent 19 year old character don't wear 9lbs of eyeshadow and eyeliner.

,, Curl it or straighten it.

,, They will know you are confident.

,,, Flip-flops and crocs may be comfy, but you're gonna get your toes stepped on.

,,"
"
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Slip on your dance shoes.,
Wear your hair up.",How to Dress for an Audition2," Choose something you can move around best in. With this, you can still imply a certain character, but the last thing you want to do is have to dance in a Maxi skirt.


While you want to be comfortable, make sure to follow any clothing rules that the directors mention. For example, if you are going to a ballet audition, you should wear a leotard and tights.
Look professional. Even though you might have a really cute pair of dance shorts or a comfy hoodie, you should wear what is appropriate for the audition. This will make you stand out against the other dancers, and look more professional to the directors.

, Go into the audition wearing Jazz shoes, Character heels, or ballet flats. You won't waste time then by having to change from your Uggs into your dance shoes. Just come with them on, even if that means you have to walk across the street in them (if you do not own any type of dance shoe, wear athletic sneakers). Make sure to choose the best pair of shoes that are appropriate for the type of dance you will be performing.

, The casting director(s) don't want to see your hair flying all over the place while you dance. They want to see your face! Even if you hate to put your hair in a ponytail, it will look way better if you do. Hey, how bad do you want this? Is putting your hair up really going to stand in your way of getting a part? Doing a bun is very important for a ballet audition.

Wear comfortable clothes.,
Wear shoes you know you can sing in.,
Wear your hair out of your face.,
Don't overdo makeup.",How to Dress for an Audition3," Remember singing is all about breathing, so if you are wearing something so tight you can't breathe in fully, you won't be able to sing your best. Try to avoid belts as they can restrict your lower abdominal movement (stomach breathing). Dresses with tight bodices prevent your rib cage expanding when you breathe, leaving you unable to breathe deeply. The last thing you want to do is run out of air, or even faint, because of the clothes you are wearing., High heels put the pelvis and upper body in a tilted position, which changes the way you have to breathe. Practice in your heels as much as you can, or wear flat shoes. Remember, the height of the heels changes the way you have to breathe, so practice with the actual shoes you will wear., Your hair can be in any style, as long as it is neat and doesn't cover your face. Singing is about acting and telling a story, and the casting director(s) want to be able to see the integrity in your face., Makeup is useful to accentuate your features, giving you a better ability to be dramatic, but keep it natural looking. Try to apply makeup with a knowledge of the space you will be auditioning in. If you will be fairly close to the casting director(s), keep the makeup light because they will be able to see your features easily. The further away they will be, the more you should put on. If there will be strong lights, everything will be washed out, so you will need more. Don't put on so much makeup that it is distracting or looks strange."
"
Wear something that expresses you!,
Don't wear something inappropriate that might prevent you from getting the part.,
Wear your hair however you want too!",How to Dress for an Audition4," This is your time to show off what you got, and what better way to do it is with your wardrobe. Go for it, wear that cute dress! It looks great on you! Wear those heels, they make your legs look fabulous. Be yourself with what you wear, the casting director(s) love to see you looking confident.

, T-shirts with inappropriate things on them, or shorts that let your butt hang out, show shirts from a different theater; all of that. Wearing things that could be risky is the wrong way to go. The casting Director(s) may look at you the wrong way. If you think it could possibly be risky, don't wear it. Choose something you know will be a-ok with the casting team!

, Don't take advice from the people who say ""You have to wear your hair up,"" because that's not true. If you want to curl it, go for it, if you want to braid it, have at it! If you want to put it up in a ponytail, be my guest!

Don't take it personally if you are not casted.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Audition with Confidence," An audition piece is meant to give the director a taste of your abilities. Two to three minutes is plenty long for an audition. If your piece is shorter, you can spend more time memorizing each part.


Usually, auditions will have a time limit. Research what the limit is beforehand and practice to keep well within it. You will feel less anxious if you don't feel rushed.;
, Practice your piece until you can go through it without a script. You will appear much more confident to the casting director if you come without notes. This will let you focus less on the words and more on the emotions you want to convey.Don't want until the week or night before to memorize your piece. Practice a little every day to avoid stage fright or forgetting your part.
If the audition involves a cold reading (where the crew gives you a piece that you've never read before), practice cold readings at home. You will appear confident if you know how to work with lines on the spot., If you have run through your audition piece inside and out, you will feel much more confident in your abilities. Treat each practice run like the real audition. Don't start over if you mess up. Instead, take a moment to compose yourself, and keep going.


When you practice your piece, run through it in front of other people. Practicing alone and in front of others will feel different.Work on them with a coach, close friend, or a fellow performer. Accustom yourself to the feeling of being watched.

, Tell them you want their honest opinion, and solicit them for constructive criticism if they offer praise. If you're aware of weak places, you can improve them before the audition.


If you struggle with anxiety before auditions, let your coach or acting friend know. They can tell you what works for them and give advice based on your personality.

, Breathing slowly and deeply will help keep your stress levels down. Shallow breathing lowers oxygen levels in your blood and makes you more prone to anxiety. Instead of breathing from your chest, breathe in from your stomach. This allows you to breathe from your diaphragm and draw in more air.Deep breaths will lower your blood pressure, relax your muscles, and calm your mind.If you ever feel anxious while practicing or auditioning, take a deep breath in from your stomach.
If you're especially nervous, try square breathing. Breathe in for four counts, hold it for four counts, breathe out for four counts, and pause for for counts. Repeat this in a cycle until your heart rate lowers., Dehydration can cause you to feel dizzy and make your heart race. If you feel lightheaded, you'll feel nervous and less confident.Drink plenty of water throughout the day before and of your audition. Keep a water bottle by your side until the moment of your audition.

, Avoid drinking caffeine the night before your big day, and go to sleep at a reasonable time. When you're well-rested, you're more likely to feel and perform at your best.Tired performers are more likely to forget their piece, which could cause your confidence to plummet.


Avoid drinking caffeine the day of, too. Caffeine will make you jumpy and irritable. You will want calm nerves and a clear mind.

, Eating something will keep your mind clear and ready to work. Avoid chocolate or dairy products if you're singing, as these can dry out your voice., Arrive at least thirty minutes before your audition so you have time to calm yourself. If you feel uptight, chat with fellow auditioners before you walk in. You'll be able to see the other auditioners as human and feel less intimidated.


If you're introverted and have social anxiety, don't push yourself! Only talk to others if you have the energy. You can practice breathing exercises instead if you need to relax.

, Performers often build a warm-up routine to get them in audition mode and rid themselves of nerves. Rituals are part of the auditioning experience. Decide what works for you and helps you feel comfortable when warming up.


Warm-up rituals are different for everyone, and it depends on what you're auditioning for. Some musicians like to practice scales before they go in. Some actors like meditating. Some dancers have a certain stretching routine. Do something that helps you focus and prepares you to perform.

, Plan what you will wear before, and make sure it's something you feel good moving around in. Don't wear something too tight or constricting. You will feel most confident in an outfit you're familiar with and you know you love., Shake the directors' hands, if offered. Introduce yourself and let them know what piece you are doing. Look each of them in the eyes while you are talking to them. Keep your back straight and try not to fidget. Pretend like you're meeting new coworkers: act friendly, but professional.


Remember to smile, even if you don't feel like it. Smiling will make you feel more approachable., Project your voice so that your directors can hear it across the room. Clear your throat if you need to.


Practice projecting your voice before the audition so you sound confident. Even if you feel nervous, a loud voice will make you seem self-assured.

, Some performers overwhelm themselves by considering what this audition will mean for their future career. Don't worry yourself with this during the audition. Instead, focus on what you must do to finish this audition.


Take every audition one step at a time. Don't worry about getting the part or impressing the casting director. Make the focus on doing your best and improving yourself.

, Don't be afraid to pause for a moment if you're nervous. Clear your mind, and breathe in from your abdomen. When you're ready, begin just as you did in your mock audition.

, Smile, take another breath, and keep going. Your casting director will understand if you make a mistake. They expect even the best performers to make a mistake sometimes. When/if you do, they will pay more attention to your behavior and appreciate performers who can pick themselves up and keep going.Remember to practice this behavior during your mock auditions. If you know what to do beforehand, you'll continue without freezing during the actual audition.

, Tell the casting director and anyone else watching that you appreciate their time and look forward to hearing back. Smile, shake their hands if offered, and walk out with your head held high. Last impressions are just as important as first impressions for projecting a confident atmosphere.

, Auditioning takes a great deal of courage and self-confidence. Pat yourself on the back for putting yourself out there, and take pride in doing your best.


Rejection can weigh you down. If you're not careful, it can even decrease your confidence in future auditions. Feeling disappointed is normal, but remember that you can't read the casting director's mind. You don't know how they came upon their decisions.

, Auditioning is more than finding the best performers: it's also choosing people who fit the part. They may not have been looking for someone who looks like you or acts like you.You might not be a good fit for this production, but you have other opportunities.


For example, Tom Hiddleston makes an excellent Loki, but he initially tried out for the role of Thor.His audition was rejected because he just didn't have what the directors were looking for. You might not be the right fit for this piece, but you could fit perfectly somewhere else.

, If you have a bad audition, write down all of your thoughts afterwards. What did you do right? What could have gone better? Make your weaknesses strengths so that you'll be ready for your next audition.


If you think you need professional help, hire an performance coach or attend local workshops. With experience comes improvement. You can't help but improve when you train.

Get a professional headshot taken.,
Search for open casting calls in your area.,
Become a member of an acting union.,
Hire an agent or booking agency.,
Develop a strong digital presence.,
Network with everyone in the industry.",How to Audition for TV Shows1," A headshot is an initial impression you make on a casting agent and director and is required if you're going to audition for a TV show.A good headshot for a television audition will embody who you are as an actor or actress. Avoid static facial expressions and think about the type of roles you are auditioning for.


If it's a comedy, you'll want to smile.
If you are trying to audition for drama or romance, a more serious or sultry look may be what casting directors are looking for.Do not cover up imperfections on your face, like moles or freckles. Your headshot should look like you because casting directors want to have a good impression of what you truly look like. If you get a drastic haircut or get older, consider getting your headshot taken again.
Look for photographers online and request to see some photos that they have taken in the past.Don't settle for a sub-par photographer. Your headshot is like your calling card. If it's low quality, it will leave a negative impression on casting directors.;
, Various websites post open casting calls in some major cities across the country like New York, LA, Boston, and Chicago. Choose the closest city for you and take the opportunities to audition. Sometimes even websites like Craigslist will post opportunities for roles in smaller, independent films.


Avoid auditions that require you to pay, or casting directors that you can't find online, as these are typically scams.Some useful websites to find casting opportunities include www.Playbill.com, www.Backstage.com, and www.Castingnetworks.com.If you can afford it, move to a major city so you can take advantage of casting opportunities.
Opportunities on smaller sets will give you the experience some casting directors are looking for.

, Many casting directors are looking for actors that are a part of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. These roles are made available to members of the SAG-AFTRA Union.As a member, you'll receive advanced notice for union auditions, and you'll have a greater capacity to network with other actors.
To be eligible to join the SAG-AFTRA Union, you must have completed three days of work under the SAG-AFTRA collective bargaining agreement.
Another way to be eligible is to join an affiliated performers union like AEA, AGMA, ACTRA, or AGVA for one year as an actor.The SAG-AFTRA Union offers additional benefits like health insurance and retirement benefits.The SAG-AFTRA requires monthly dues as well as an initial registration fee.
If you are not part of the union, look for nonunion opportunities.

, Booking agencies and successful agents will usually have a network in the industry and can help you obtain auditions.Search for local booking agencies in your area and find one that has a high rating from previous actors and actresses. Use any networking connections that you have in the industry and ask friends if they've worked with any suitable agents.Choose an agent or agency that you feel comfortable with.
If you find work yourself you may catch an agent's eye. Make sure to look for work on your own while searching for an agent.

, Actors can get their foot in the door by creating a strong digital presence. Make sure that you have a working website and that your IMDB is updated. If you are brand new to acting, you can try to make videos on YouTube or other popular video websites to get recognition. Register social media accounts on all the most popular platforms including Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and Tumblr.


Keep your social media regularly updated so your fans keep coming back for more content and feel a greater connection to you.
Refrain from saying anything offensive, and abstain from arguing with people online.
Agents are looking for a previous track record that includes a body of work. If they can't find you online, they have nothing to judge but your audition tape.

, Get to know everyone. You never know when another actor or actress will get sick and the studio needs to find a replacement quickly. If you don't know anyone else in the industry, you can meet other actors at acting workshops held in your area. You can also go to theatrical performances and mingle with people after the show. If you do end up getting an audition, there will be other actors and actresses in the waiting room that you can talk to.If you know the right people you'll hear about auditions before they are made available to others vying for the same role.
Try to be polite and shake hands with everyone you meet. Remember the names of people who can help advance your career.

, There is no dress code, but you should select clothes that demonstrate your individuality and seriousness as an artist.Wear comfortable clothes. Tight pants that make it hard to breath or shoes that hurt your feet are not recommended, simply due to the fact that these items may make it harder for you to sing at your best.
Do not come in costume. This includes chicken costumes, superhero costumes, mascot costumes, and so on. There is plenty of room for creative flair, but costumes give casting team an impression that you are not serious about your audition.

, Even if you have an audition time for the early morning, there is a good chance that you will be at the audition all day. To prevent yourself from getting fatigued, dehydrated, or hungry, it is recommended that you bring snacks and water.

, You will not be permitted to enter without these two items.

Practice acting new material.,
Master the art of cold-reading.,
Record yourself practicing to see how you look on video.,
Audition in front of other actors and get feedback.,
Pick an appropriate, comfortable outfit for the audition.",How to Audition for TV Shows2," Depending on the show and the network, you may receive a script, or you may get lines to read right on the spot, sometimes known as a cold-read.If you've received the script, make sure to study and memorize your lines carefully. If you have to select the material yourself, make sure to pick out a piece that will allow you to show a dynamic range.


Don't choose a script that only shows one emotion like anger or sadness.
Use personally relevant pieces and stay away from experimental scripts, or scripts that don't show off your true acting ability. , The more you practice cold-reading, the more you'll become accustomed to taking on a new role with only a couple of minutes to prepare. When you receive a script to cold-read, don't panic and try to memorize the entire script. Instead, relax, read the script carefully, then try to understand the circumstances of the story, your characters motivations, and how the scene affects the plot.


Do not look down at your script while the casting agent is reading lines. Casting directors want to be able to gauge your acting abilities, which includes reacting to events in the story or lines in the dialogue., TV is a visual medium, and much of your acting will take place in your face. You can also see how your acting looks on film and alter it to become a better actor or actress. Take note of your facial expressions and any bad habits that you have so you can try to alter them.Bad habits include a noticeable twitch or facial gesture that you do habitually. Take notice of the way you pronounce words and make sure that you enunciate.

, A TV actor who has experience can provide you with valuable insider knowledge of how auditions and casting work in your area. Talk to friends in the industry or ask a teacher if you're taking an acting class. They can also help you with your audition.


You can ask by saying, ""Hey, I have an audition coming up, and I wanted to get some feedback on my performance. I need someone to be completely honest and objective so that I can land this role.""

, You should choose an outfit that embodies the character that you are auditioning for, but also remember to wear something that's comfortable. Coming in with an unrequested costume will not win you over to casting directors, and could cost you the audition.Wearing something comfortable will put you at ease and give you the confidence to concentrate on acting.

Be polite and courteous.,
Refrain from overacting.,
Let your personality shine.,
Understand your role and film for your audition.,
Incorporate your character's physicality into your role.,
Be confident with your acting ability.",How to Audition for TV Shows3," It will not help you land the role if you're rude to the casting director. Remember to shake their hands, say ""hello,"" and ask how their day was before jumping into the role.The casting director will be making the final decision on whether you get the role, so make sure that you leave a good impression.


Don't let the small talk ruin the audition. Try to gauge the casting directors attitude and whether they enjoy small talk.

, Concentrate on physical facial expressions and your vocal delivery. Make it as realistic and genuine as possible. Try to convey the emotion of the character without overdoing it.If you come from a theater background, it's reasonable to assume that you are used to using grandiose physical gestures and using a lot of energy in your line delivery. This does not translate to TV most of the time.

, Casting directors don't want a typical type of character fulfilling a role. Make sure that your personality shines through whatever role you are assuming. Use your lines to develop a meaningful and unique personality for whatever role you are presented with.


For example, if you are playing a detective, don't try to replicate what is popular amongst detectives as the performance can often come off as forced and unrealistic., Extrapolate what your characters motivations are and what drives them.Much like actual life, personalities are not based upon a person's actions. What's more significant is what drives and motivates them to commit those actions. Get into the brain of your character and think how they would think. Consider your character's likes and dislikes, and what drives them to feel this way. Try to relate emotions to your personal life and draw parallels between these feelings. Do your homework on your character and the conditions they've lived in or how situations in their past affects their behavior now.


Even if you've never been in a similar situation, there's a good chance you've felt similar emotions.
If you aren't given any background information on your character, make one up. Create their motivation in your head to understand the role and act more like that character. For example, if tasked with portraying an angry son, create a backstory in your head of what drives the son's anger and motivations., Acting is not only about delivering lines well, it's also about embodying your character. Think of how your character would stand, talk, walk, sit, or gestures that they would use in conversation.You make a greater impact with an audience when they believe you are the character.

, Something that casting directors are looking for is your ability to own your character. Don't make excuses or apologize to the casting director. Go in with a vision of your role and a goal to land the part, and deliver your audition with confidence.If you have prepared beforehand, you'll feel more confident going into the audition.

Read through the actual text of the monologue.,
Determine where the character is and what the character is doing.,
Pick a starting position.,
Play the scene.,
Repeat playing the scene.,
Allow the casting director, director, or producer to see your work.",How to Block a Monologue for an Acting Audition," Monologues are generally directed at another character, or in the case of a soliloquy, are directed right at the audience. Determine who your character is speaking to in the context of the piece.;
, When you perform a monologue, you are stepping into the life of that character at that very moment. For instance a person in church will act differently than someone who is attending a sporting event.

, Given the circumstances of where the character is and who the character is talking to in the scene, select a starting position that makes sense. Because many monologues are performed in a room without a set, you will typically be limited to standing, sitting, or walking and pacing.

, In order to block the scene, emulate what feels natural. For instance, if you are yelling at someone, it may feel natural to start at a distance and end up right in their face. If someone has just died in the scene, you may start seated next to them, and then get up and move to a window. Respond to text of the monologue and what ""feels"" natural.

, The act of blocking a monologue is one of experimentation. Remember that you do not have to worry about your fellow actors since you will be the only one on stage. Play the scene several times until you begin to naturally find where you want to move each time. Then lock that in as your blocking for the monologue.

, Remember not to upstage yourself--turn away from the people you are performing for--during the performance, unless you are using it for dramatic effect. As the actor, you will have the choice to play the monologue directly to someone (usually a casting director or reader) or to no one. Whichever you choose, make sure you stay with that specific focal point for the whole piece. Otherwise, the people you are reading for may have trouble following you.

Practice in front of a friend or family member.,
Read a book while you wait.,
Get into character.,
See the cup half full.,
Just do it.,
Don't worry about forgetting your lines.,
Don't look at the judges as hostile towards you.,
Pretend they aren't even watching.,
Don't be afraid that you'll end up freezing on stage.,
Stay positive.",How to Be Comfortable at Auditions," Practicing in front of someone you're comfortable with will make it easier for you to perform calmly when it comes time to perform in front of the judges. You could even pretend you're still just practicing with your good friend.
, A book will keep you busy so that you don't start pacing, overthinking things, worrying or just getting really nervous. Being occupied will also keep others from talking to you, distracting you or even making you nervous intentionally.

, While waiting for your turn, do your best to get into character. When you're really in character you're going to be more comfortable and less nervous., When you get on stage and there are a lot of people watching the audition, just think how much worse it would be if it was just you and the judges. If you are performing just for the judges. then use the same strategy and think how much more nerve wracking it would be with an audience. Seeing your audition as an easier scenario compared to another will make you less nervous and more comfortable., When you're on stage and it's time for your performance to start, without thinking of anything else, just do it. Just start and keep going and it'll be over before you know it. Always remember that the sooner you start, the sooner you finish., If you forget your lines the judges won't put your head on a pike. They know it's natural for anyone new to auditions to be nervous. You need to remember that these judges have seen countless auditions in their years in the industry so someone forgetting their lines is certainly nothing new to them. If you forget your lines you can also ad-lib. While saying what's on the script should always be your first option, if you forget some lines it's better to ad-lib through that part than to just stop talking. And besides, you probably already have the lines well memorized by now and you're worrying for nothing. Once you start your performance, you'll be surprised when all of a sudden it's already done and the judges might have even liked it., You shouldn't feel as though the judges are out to get you. In reality they're just interested in seeing your performance the same as a family member would be. Would you be this nervous in front of your Aunt? Didn't think so!, When you get to auditions, pretend the judges and audience are not watching you. If you can do it alone, then this may help a bit., Because first of all you probably won't. And even if you freeze on stage, let yourself know that the judges won't hurt you. If you don't get the part, that's okay too., If you didn't get the role, don't think you messed up somehow and become discouraged from future auditions. In reality you shouldn't be afraid to mess up again. Even with a near flawless audition, there's no guarantee you'll get cast. You see, the judges see the people as a product, they'll only buy that product if it is exactly what they have in mind for their project. If you keep auditioning, your bound to be the product that someone is shopping for!"

Rock the audition!",How to Audition for Legally Blonde the Musical,"


Watch the entire musical (they have the MTV Version on YouTube which is great, just search ""Legally Blonde The Musical"" on YouTube and it should come up.)






Watch the original movie






reading the plot and character list on Wikipedia
listening to the cast recording This will give you a leg up on the competition because after doing all of this you will know the show like the back of your hand!





;
, You should pick about 3 to focus on unless you know you only want a specific part or you are open to any part. For guys, see step 3, for girls, see step 4.


There are only a few guys parts in Legally Blonde, but all of them are great roles. If you are usually typecast as the handsome leading man, you probably want to try out for Warner or even Professor Callahan. They both have some great moments in the show. For Warner, listen to ""Serious"" and try to pick a song like that (it might even be a pop song). Professor Callahan's main song is ""Blood In The Water"" so try to pick something along the lines of that. Another role is Kyle, the UPS guy. This is a good part for someone who doesn't necessarily want a lot of lines or songs, but it is one of the most scene-stealing parts in the show. Make sure your butt looks good in tight pants! The male lead in this show is not Warner, but nerdy, mousy Emmett. It is a great part for a tenor as his songs are relatively high for the male voice. Make sure you dress a little nerdy for the audition, but still cute. If Emmett was ugly, Elle wouldn't fall for him as she does!
There are so many girls parts in the show, so don't be upset if there is a ton of competition...everyone should get a part! The Delta Nu's all have featured solos, Kate has a large part in ""What You Want' and Serena, Pillar, and Margot act as a greek chorus throughout the whole show. These are all big dancing roles, so brush up your dancing for the auditions! Brooke Wyndham is a super fun role as she has a huge, energetic song, ""Whipped Into Shape"". This is a vocally as well as physically demanding role as she must belt up to a high G while jump roping and dancing for 3-5 minutes. Paulette has a belty ballad, ""Ireland"" and her character is one of the most loveable ones in the show. Look into songs by Orfeh, the original Paulette on Broadway, for your audition. Vivienne is a fun part too, and she has a small song in the end of the show. She must show a wide range of emotions as she goes from Elle's arch enemy to one of her closest friends. And of course, there would be no show without Elle Woods! Elle must posses kindness, bubbliness, and confidence. Be careful not to copy Laura Bell Bundy or Reese Witherspoon though. Make Elle your own character.

, Look into other musicals by the composers like ""Bat Boy"" or ""Sarah, Plain and Tall"". Rent, Wicked, and Hairspray have similar styled music but be careful because these audition songs are often overdone. You can also do musical theatre styled covers or pop songs, much like they do on Glee.

, Be sure to arrive early and dress appropriately. And most of all, BE CONFIDENT! Nobody wants an Elle Woods or Delta Nu girl show can't smile. Keep it Positive, as Elle and her sorority sisters would say!

Try to relax, take deep breaths, and act more natural on your second read, if you are asked for one.

, After you do a first read, the casting director may ask you to improvise or give variety. Change up how you approach the script. Alter your voice and your body language. Do a different character or persona when you perform the script.Most casting directors will ask you to do this so it is smart to have a few alternative interpretations of the script on hand for the audition.

, The casting director may give you suggestions on how to perform the script or adjustments you can make on your second read. Always follow their instruction.

Audition.",How to Audition for an Orchestra," Many orchestras post information about the audition on the website. If this does not include open audition times and piece selections, contact the orchestra's public relation agent, or whoever is in charge of auditions.


Many youth and community orchestras have openings year-round. School orchestras often treat orchestra as a class, and take auditions at the beginning of each semester or quarter.;
, Typically, the orchestra will assign you an orchestral excerpt to perform at the audition, and often a sonata as well. Practice these every day leading up to the audition. If the orchestra is competitive, aim to practice at least two hours a day for several weeks. If this is a school orchestra or a more casual orchestra, just practice as much as you have time for.


One common mistake is to only practice the whole excerpt from start to finish each time. That is an important part of practicing, but you should also identify the most difficult sections and practice them on their own.
You may be expected to find the sheet music yourself. You can buy it online, or order it from a public library with a music session.

, If asked to perform a solo piece, choose a piece you know well. Ideally, you should pick a piece that demonstrates a range of techniques and musicality; is a concerto or other solo piece with orchestral accompaniment; and that shows off your strengths. However, at a non-professional level, it's more important to play your best. Most orchestras will not mind if you play an orchestra part or anything else you're comfortable with.

, You only need to play the short excerpt assigned you, but it will help your performance to understand the whole movement, or at least a good five minute chunk leading up to your excerpt. Try to find several recordings online and choose the one you like best. If you can, put it on your phone and listen to it frequently.

, Many auditions at the school and university level include a sight reading portion. You may need to hum a portion of the music they give you in addition to playing it on your instrument. Although you won't know the piece in advance, you can practice sight reading unfamiliar pieces to improve your skills in this area.

, Most orchestras at this level (especially grade school orchestras) do not care how you dress for the audition. The highest priority is freedom of movement, since you want full control over your instrument. It is a good idea to avoid shorts, ratty jeans, or other extra-casual clothing, but you do not need to get fancy. When in doubt, go business casual.

, Depending on how many other people are auditioning, you might be waiting for a while. Bring a snack, plus something to occupy yourself, such as an engrossing book or phone game. This will make it much easier to avoid nerves and boredom.


If you're nervous about the audition, make sure the snack won't upset your stomach.

, Show up at thirty minutes early to allow for delays and warm up time. Treat everyone politely while you are waiting, and when you go in to your audition. Smile and make eye contact with the judges before you play, and thank them afterward. Do your best to show that you take the audition seriously.


Turn your phone on silent before you play.
The judges will often stop you before you finish the piece, once they've made a decision. This has nothing to do with how well you did, so don't worry.

, Even before you have applied to audition, purchase a book of orchestral excerpts. These are examples of the pieces you will be assigned, so it's great preparation to practice them. Incorporate them into your daily practice, and familiarize yourself with the pieces they come from.


It may help motivation to choose a mix of easy and difficult excerpts to work on at one time, and cycle through them. For example, work on two or three easy to moderate excerpts today, then switch to two or three difficult excerpts tomorrow. Continue alternating between these groups.

, At the professional level, joining an orchestra is applying to a job. You may be competing with over one hundred applicants, so cast the widest net you can. Here are a few ways to discover opportunities to audition:


Join your local chapter of a musician's union, such as the American Federation of Musicians. These typically send out regular newsletters notifying you of orchestral auditions with contact details.
Regularly check local newspapers, trade paper, concert fliers, and music venue announcements for audition chances.
Look up orchestras' audition contact info online and call to inquire whether there are open positions. If there are, ask for information about the try-out pieces and schedule a try-out date.

, When a professional orchestra has an opening, they invite musicians to submit their application. This may include any or all of the following:


A resume of your music performance history
A portfolio of music you have played
A letter of introduction or reference letters from previous conductors, teachers, and fellow musicians

, If possible, attend the orchestra's recitals and performances. Introduce yourself to the maestro or maestra. If the orchestra is not in your area, listen to recordings of its past performances.


Also introduce yourself to musicians who play your instrument, and ask whether they are available to hire for lessons. Most will be, unless they are in a world-class orchestra, and they can offer advice tailored to the preferences of the people who judge auditions.

, If a professional orchestra accepts you application, it will send you an assigned excerpt of an orchestral piece. (In fact, you may go through three round of increasing difficulty, but you will start with one assigned piece.) You will typically have a few weeks to practice this. Practice this daily, and listen to several recordings of the full movement or piece so you understand the excerpt in a broader context. Aim for the correct phrasing, articulation, and musical nuance for the composer and period in question.


At the professional level, a string player will likely need four to six hours of practice a day to be competitive. Other musicians may need to limit themselves to shorter practice sessions due to the demands of the instrument.
Some orchestras request you bring your own piece instead, so — as always — have at least one piece you can play perfectly.

, You will usually get a chance to perform a solo piece as well. Concertos are the most common choice, since they demonstrate your ability to play with an orchestra. A solo sonata is the second best option. Choose a piece that demonstrates a wide range of ability, including both technical skill and musicality.


It can be risky to choose a ""show off"" piece. Remember you are auditioning for an orchestra. Your ability to play a Paganini solo is not very relevant.

, Practice with a metronome so you know you are achieving the correct tempo. Record your practice sessions and listen to them with a critical ear. If you do not currently have a professional music coach, hire one and focus on your audition performance during lessons.

, Almost all professional orchestras use blind auditions to remove bias based on sex and other factors. The judges sit behind a screen, and the performer does not speak.

, You may contact the orchestra and ask about the dress code if you are unsure, but fancy dress is almost never a requirement. Since most auditions are blind, the most important factors in clothing choice are comfort and full range of motion. There is a chance that you will advance to an interview stage, so do dress in a business casual or another lightly formal outfit. This could be neat slacks and an ironed dress shirt, or a modest, black dress. Avoid over-elaborate makeup and jewelry.


Do not wear hard-soled shoes to a blind audition, as the clacking on the floor may cause the judges to assume you are female.
If you have long hair, pull it back.
Cellists should not wear short skirts.

, It's possible you will be waiting for hours as other people audition ahead of you. Do not schedule anything after the audition. Bring a snack that's gentle on your stomach, as well as a book, puzzle collection, or other distraction that will keep you from sitting there anxious.

, At a blind audition, all you need to do is sit down and follow the judges' instructions. Do not speak, as this could reveal information about you the judges are not supposed to know. If you do meet the judges face-to-face, which is rare at professional auditions, clearly announce your name and the solo piece you are playing, and appear as confident as possible.

Film a reel.,
Embrace your “character” and back story.,
Hold nothing back.",How to Audition for Bad Girls Club on Oxygen3," Submitting a casting reel can boost your chances at getting on the show.

Introduce yourself and explain why you’d be an excellent cast member. Don’t tell them why you think you’re a bad girl, tell them why you ARE a bad girl.

Additionally, highlight the interesting things in your past that have made you a bad girl today. Make sure that your online form, your presence at the casting calls, and your optional filmed reel all create a cohesive image of who you are.


Personal tragedy might not be fun to talk about, but it can make you a fascinating and relatable television personality. Open up about any heartbreak in your life.
Reveal anything about yourself that you think no one else can say. Casting directors will get thousands of videos, so make sure yours stands out.

, Don’t hurt your chances by second-guessing, doubting, or censoring yourself. Give yourself a pep talk before you begin your auditioning process, and remind yourself that you’re an interesting, strong, entertaining person. If you aren’t confident in who you are, and if you can’t hold your own in a room filled with outspoken women, you’ll probably be overlooked by the Bad Girls Club casting directors.


Fake it ‘til you make it. Even if you feel shy and unsure of yourself, mimic someone you know who is uninhibited, candid, and strong-willed. Soon, these traits can rub off on you and it won’t be “fake” anymore.

Note that the first step to an audition is having confidence.,
Understand that in passing an audition for a play or film, you will be expected to dedicate an enormous amount of your time and energy to the project.,
Be aware of play types.,
Make sure you are a team player.,
Recognize that there are big differences between the styles of auditioning for films and auditioning for stage plays.,
Audition Notices: So now you know what it is you are going to be involved in.,
Understand that some of the film auditions will require you to send in a headshot/resume.,
Find an agent.,
Understand that if you find a call for actors,to look at the character types and see if you fit.,
Prepare to prepare: Read the audition's requirements.,
Find a monologue: This may be one of the most difficult steps in this process.,
Before the audition: Now that you've found the monologues you need, memorize them.,
During the audition: So the audition has started and you've done all the paperwork and all your prepping.,
Post-Audition: This is probably the toughest part of the audition, even more so than monologue hunting.",How to Audition for a Play or Movie," The assessors aren't looking for someone who fidgets and doesn't want to be in front of people.;
, If you work full time, have other major projects, go to school, (if you want to do this full time, homeschooling might help), or a family to take care of, this may not be the best time to pursue a role in a production. If you have the time (usually around 3-4 hours a night) for rehearsals, fittings, and performances, you should be okay. Don't forget that in addition to that 3-4 hours at night, it takes loads of time - outside of rehearsing - to memorize a play, monologues, and stage direction. You should always be prepared, mentally and physically, to give the project more than just rehearsal time.

, We all know there are dramas and there are comedies, but within those, there are many others. Classics - Shakespeare, Chekov, and the Greek playwrights, sometimes use a very complex language structure, characterized by very long passages of text. Don't be discouraged or frightened by that aspect; it will eventually get easier, once the director gets involved and you've had time to go over the play.

, Other actors don't take kindly to anyone who has an ego the size of Greenland, who projects an attitude that says, ""I'm the star."" Especially in a community or university theater environment, there is simply no room to think you're better than anyone else. After all, this is supposed to be a fun learning experience, and since no one is being paid (much at least) to be there, no one owes you anything, even if you do get the lead role.

, Film tends to stray more towards intimate acting, close ups, headshots, and more realistic movements. Also film auditions tend to focus on interactions and scenes, rather than long monologues. For stage plays, the auditions usually start out with monologues, and if the director thinks you may fit in their production they may make you do scenes with the other auditioners for the callbacks. So know what you are preparing for, if you don't have a large stage presence or can't project, theater may not be for you. And if you can't emote in close-ups, or have the will to stand around while the techies set up the shot, then film might not be your cup of tea. So be aware of the different styles before you go through all the trouble of preparing.

, We'll mainly be focusing on the stage play style of auditioning because the method can be adapted to fit a film audition. After you've decided to commit yourself, find a production to audition for. Usually you can find audition notices in your local university's theater department (some college main stage shows may allow people from the community to fill roles, rather than strictly students) or find your local community center and see if any directors have posted a call for actors. On occasion they may advertise in the local paper (usually in the entertainment/arts section) or community magazine. For people living in New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut and are looking for theater, Show Business Weekly Magazine is a great way to find casting calls. They post a ton on their website daily at ShowBusinessWeekly.com, and they also have great directories of current casting directors and agents. Another useful tool that Show Business Weekly offers is The Theatrical Index- detailing all plays in various states of production. This could get you in before the audition even exists! For films, auditions are usually held in large cities (mainly Los Angeles or New York City, but on occasion in places like Seattle, Portland, Dallas, San Francisco, etc.) Some production companies will advertise them on the Internet, usually through casting call websites.

, This is normal, because they often base on appearance first, and talent second. Unfortunately, that's the way it goes in ""Hollywood"", but nobody said this was a fair business. Also be aware that for auditions and productions (film or stage) you may have to travel a considerable distance. For example, you might be called down to LA because someone liked your headshot, or some director liked your audition two counties over. So be prepared to travel if you get cast. In a worst case scenario (mainly film) you may have to relocate to the area of the production.

, On occasion you can find agencies in major towns and they will have larger connections than you might. But remember, agents take 10%, so if you get a paying job, you will probably take a pay cut if an agent found it for you.

, If you are a 40-year-old white male, you probably won't fit into a role for a 20- to 25-year-old Hispanic male. If you are a guy trying to audition for ""The Vagina Monologues"" or ""Top Girls"", most likely you won't be cast. So be aware of the character types. Sometimes directors may make concessions for actors (such as if you are younger and they can't find enough older people to fill roles, or you are a good enough actor to fill the role, etc). If you are ""close"" then don't be afraid to audition. Make sure and write down all information (contact numbers, play name and author, directions to audition, etc.) so you aren't scrambling to find out information at the last minute. It is a professional courtesy not to take down audition notices until after the audition has happened, so please leave the audition flyer where you found it, don't take it with you (unless there are many in the area where you found them). Now it's time to prepare.

, Most notices will tell you what you need for the auditions (physically and performance-wise), Such as headshots, resumes, dance clothes and what to do for the audition. Usually for contemporary productions, the requirements are two contrasting monologues (comedic and dramatic). For Shakespearean plays, classical soliloquies from other Shakespearean plays, Marlowe, or Thomas Kyd will do. Aside from that, the notice will tell you what else you need: A song, a devised piece, etc. Be sure to follow these things to the letter. To go into a Shakespeare audition with a Tennessee Williams monologue or some Arthur Miller is usually suicide for the audition, especially if you tell them you read the notice.

, For the monologues you need, you will need to scour over many different plays and anthologies to find the right one. Most of the time, the best course of action is to find a monologue that is similar to the play you are auditioning for (i.e. For a Tennessee Williams play, use an Arthur Miller written monologue). This will enable the director to see how well you can play in the style and not have to envision how, for example, a Shakespearean actor fits into a more contemporary style. For help in finding monologues, ask a local theater buff, a theater professor, or talk to the director of the production. These people will be able to help you the most, and will probably have the resources from which you can draw. If all else fails, go to the library and just begin reading plays that take place in the same time period as the production for which you are auditioning. On the flip side, if you already have your monologues, then you've already won half the battle.

, There is no set way to do this; it is just something each person does on his or her own. Just make sure they are fully memorized. Most directors won't cast people who flub badly during their monologues or read off of a script during their first audition (unless they saw something in you that they really liked or need). So once memorized, keep practicing until the day of the audition. When the audition comes, take a few hours beforehand to prepare. First: Dress for success. No sneakers, no jeans, no ripped t-shirts, and no scraggly five o'clock shadows (or the female equivalent). It won't look good if you get up on stage and look disheveled. If you have to dance with your audition, bring a spare set of clothes so as not to ruin your nice ones before you do your acting audition. After dressing and grooming, make sure to bring all your copies of headshots and resumes. Bring more than one, so if it is a panel of people auditioning you, each of them have one; it will help them remember you better. Also, get there early. Most productions will have you fill out forms detailing your past experience, vital statistics, and availability. They may also have time slots for you to sign up to do your audition. The earlier you arrive, the more slots you can pick from. Arriving early also gives you time to warm up. Do vocal exercises, stretches, and tongue twisters. Don't botch your monologue just because you didn't stretch out your tongue. Last, be friendly to all those around you. Don't be confrontational. If you do get cast and they also get cast, you'll be around them for the whole duration of the production and they're going to remember if you were unkind during the audition.

, Sit quietly and wait your turn. Make sure and listen; in some auditions the Stage Manager or Director will give you added instructions that weren't on the notice. Those may be vitally important, such as time limits on monologues, or the procedure in which they will audition. Wait for your name to be called and then proceed to the stage. Before saying anything, make sure that you have their full attention. You don't want to begin while they are still writing or talking to one another about the previous actor. Wait til you've achieved eye contact with all of them so that they can listen to you from the very beginning. Then, make sure and SLATE for the director, regardless if they know you from prior contact. Now, do your monologue. After you do your monologue, the director may ask you some questions or ask you to do a part from your monologues again. Be patient, answer all questions truthfully, and do the requested part to the utmost of your ability. It may pay off when the director makes their final decision. Once finished, take a small bow and say thank you, and exit so the next person can audition.

, This is the time when you feel most helpless - your fate, at least for this role - is now out of your hands. After the audition you can either stick around or leave; just make sure you know where the call back list will be posted or, if there are no callbacks, where the final cast list will be posted and when. If you need to leave, be courteous to the other actors and leave quietly. Once home, don't stress about the audition. Most times actors post-audition will psyche themselves out by analyzing each and every part of the audition, then agonizing until they see the cast list. One word: DON'T. Sometimes there will be many days in between audition and final casting, and sometimes there is even a second audition for call backs to narrow down the field. If that's the case, then be prepared to work with other actors in scenes from the play, and possibly even read for characters you don't want the roles for. But whatever you do before the cast list goes up, don't stress out. It's out of your control, and if you don't get cast, it's not because you are a bad actor. A more likely reason is that the director couldn't find a place for you in his or her vision of the production. Don't get upset with anyone there. This is no time to start blaming anyone for anything, including yourself. Things simply didn't work out. After the cast list is posted, it's perfectly fine to ask the director what you need to improve upon or could have done better. Directors are usually very gracious about this because they can analyze it from a 3rd person's point of view and tell you exactly what it was they were looking for. But be careful not to be rude. Don't start slinging accusations and don't be upset with them because you weren't cast. But, if you were cast, congratulations, you made it and hopefully this guide helped you do it! Good luck out there!

Choose your song very carefully, selecting one well within your voice range.,
Make sure your song isn't one which is commonly used, as your director has probably heard ""Tomorrow"" from Annie or ""On My Own"" from Les Miserables or ""Good Morning Baltimore"" from Hairspray too many times already.,
Project your voice!,
Some directors may already have in mind their own interpretation of a character, so you may be at a disadvantage of interpreting it another way.,
Be confident!,
Do not worry if you are stopped midway; this is not a bad sign.,
Directors look for things off stage too.,
Make sure not to have dairy or anything spicy or with seeds in it before you sing.",How to Audition For a Musical," If you can't hit that high B-flat more than nine times out of ten, don't do it. You want to be completely confident about your song. Also, the more you enjoy the song, the more any onlooker will as well. Never sing when you can't, especially if your throat is sore or strained!;
, A unique song will make you stand out in the director's mind and will set you apart from everybody else. It may seem natural to perform a song from the musical which you are auditioning for, but this can backfire if you don't exactly fit the image the director has in mind.


Don't do a song from this musical, choose one that is similar in style to those of the show for which you are auditioning. Don't audition for Mary Poppins with a song from Rent! Look for similar time periods, composers, and themes. It's great if you can find a song by the same composer, but never pick a song from the musical you are auditioning for (unless required to), because if you don't fit with their mental image, they probably won't consider you.

, Ever notice that the people who get the big parts are the ones who can speak and sing very loudly! You could be the best actor in the world, but if you're so quiet that you can't be heard above the music, who's going to know about it? Practice ahead of time. Go outside and just belt out whatever comes to mind as loud as you possibly can. (Just don't make it look like screaming) It will help. However, if louder means more off-key, be careful, because nobody likes to listen to a wrong note that is very loud.

, Most open-minded directors, however, will be open to new and interesting interpretations (as long as they are reasonable), and this may go over well with him or her. Just be sure that you commit to ""something"" because a strong commitment to an unexpected interpretation is infinitely better than no commitment at all.

, (Or, ""Act"" confident.) Confidence is key--if you look confident (even if you don't feel that way), the directors will probably like your performance more. Having the guts to stand in front of an audience and sing out with confidence is courageous, and they'll like you for it!

, It either means that the director has seen enough to make a judgment, or is now going to give you instructions on how to perform it differently. It is KEY that you be able to follow instructions and pay attention to notes, and your director wants to see how well you do this.

, When another person is up on stage, be respectful. That means being quiet; you might learn something about the play, or ""How to act"" from the person who is on stage.


Always say, ""Thank you for your time."" afterward.

, These will clog up your throat.

Think of acting much like an artist or an author, in the sense you need to develop the right mentality before you can start.,
Visualize any scenes that pose a problem.,
Practice ""being"" the character.,
When trying to convey an emotion try to make yourself believe that you are the character.,
Remember the conveying of emotion is more than just words and tone.,
Studying is an important part of acting.",How to Show Real Emotion when Acting," Read the script or study the story and try to understand why each character reacts the way they do and how you would feel in that situation.;
, Why does the character react this way? What is the character thinking? What is the person usually like (posture, tone, register, age, body movements etc.) and try to build up the character. Sometimes it is easy to make the character like you in some way and it can work, however acting should be like wearing a mask. You become someone different and afterwards remove the mask again.

, Find a mirror and recite lines while in character. If possible, practice posture, tone, body movement and register to try to iron out any issues with believability. Try to criticize but make sure you are realistic and not overly critical.

, Try to build up their fears, their feelings and immerse yourself in the story. It may seem slightly obsessive but most actors use this technique. Al Pacino remarked that during the filming of Scarface, he went into a different world and felt as if Al was gone., Posture and gestures add to the effect and make it realistic.

, Study any aspects of your character in greater detail and anything you don't understand in the story. Watch videos and pay attention to the way the person moves, speaks and stands. What register do they have? What tells you they are sad? What facial expressions are they using? What is their tone like? Also remember depending on the sex, age, and background of your character, they may react differently. A gruff, Glaswegian gangster will not start to cry in front of all his friends, will he?

Dress like a mime (optional).,
Use your body to talk.,
Start with basic mime techniques: There are some fairly basic lessons that most mimes start with..


Cultivate your imagination.,
Grab a rope.,
Pretend to be in a box.,
Take on the wind.,
Mime eating.,
Walk in place.,
Make the mime interesting.,
Make yourself be the object.",How to Mime," If you want to dress up as a mime, try:


Wearing mime makeup. A mime is instantly identifiable by his or her makeup—white grease paint over the face (but not on the throat), thick black eyeliner with stylized ""tears"" running to about the middle of the cheekbones, dark painted-on eyebrows, and black or dark red lipstick. You might also try small circles of light pink blush for a happy or girlish mime.
Wearing a mime costume. Serious mimes might not wear the classic ""costume"" anymore, but it's an easily recognizable Halloween or party costume. Find a black-and-white horizontally striped shirt, ideally with a boat neck and three-quarter sleeves. Wear dark pants, black suspenders, white wrist-length gloves, and a black bowler hat to complete the look. You don't have to wear a bowler hat. You can wear a black or red beret.;
, Talking or mouthing words is unnecessary during miming. Instead, use facial expressions, gestures and posture to do the ""talking.""


Use a mirror (or an audience) to assess what movements are the most successful in conveying emotions, attitudes and reactions. A full-length mirror is a necessity for beginners, but bear in mind the mirror is a friend you will need to leave behind at performance time.
A video camera, if available, is another invaluable tool.

, Using your imagination cannot be overemphasized in creating illusions. Most important is for a mime to truly believe the illusion is real. Naturally the more real the illusion is for the mime, the more realistic it will be for your audience. This can be accomplished through practice. For instance, pretend the wall is real. See the wall in different colors. Feel the wall in different textures i.e. feel it rough, smooth, wet, dry, cold or hot. Use these same techniques while practicing all illusions. You will also find your body reacting naturally to the illusion if you are convinced it's real.
Take advantage of a fixed point. This may be more commonly referred to as 'pointe fixe', however that is simply the original French wording of 'fixed point.' This is an incredibly simple idea: The mime locates a point with his body, and then keeps it motionless in space. This technique is the basis of all illusions a mime can create.
Add lines to fixed points. The line builds upon Fixed Point, at first, by simply adding a second fixed point in space. What makes this a unique technical skill is the added difficulty of keeping two points the same relative distance from each other. Also, the relative distance between the two points becomes the definition of this 'construction block'. As such, the line may become 'un-fixed' as long as the two points are kept steady in their relation to one another. A good application of this concept is the 'mime wall'.
Make a dynamic line. Whereas the Line did not apply force to its points, the dynamic line adds that element. This is the idea applied to 'pulling the rope', but it can be applied to virtually any use of force in an illusion. The secret to this concept is synchronizing the impact of an imaginary force throughout the body. In that respect Dynamic Line is essentially an understanding of physics applied to the human body. This may seem complicated but you can get a sense for it very easily: Find a wall and place both of your hands on it at approximately shoulder height. Push lightly into the wall with your hands. As you push try to feel where pressure builds up in your body. You should feel pressure in your hands, of course, but you should also feel some tension in your shoulders and hips. If you can't feel anything, gently increase the pressure until you do. Also try different positions and feel how they change the pressures in your body. Dynamic Line calls upon the memory of forces like the ones in the above exercise to create realistic illusions of imaginary forces.
""Manipulate"" space and matter. This is a fancy phrase for ""making things out of thin air"". This is the most complicated technique to explain because it makes use of many of the elements from the previous three. It is best served by an example illusion: dribbling a basketball. Using only one hand, the mime imitates much of the idea behind Dynamic Line, however by using only one hand, he only uses one point. Instead of two points, the mime transforms his remaining point into a shape: a rounded palm with fingers gently curled over it. This shape defines the 'space' where the illusion exists and allows the basketball, the 'matter', to exist in the illusion. Space / Matter Manipulation can be used to create any number of objects, characters, or events by utilizing this principle.

, Pretend to have a rope dangling before you and attempt to climb it.


Slide down and clamber back up for best effect. When you reach the top, wipe the perspiration off your brow. Climbing a rope is a very difficult illusion if done correctly. Imagine and feel your full body weight. If you are really climbing a rope, your muscles will stretch and strain. Your face will grimace in painful effort. Wiping sweat from your brow will be a natural reaction. If you have never climbed a real rope, do so with supervision in a padded gym. Make mental notes of your actions and reactions even though many illusions may not be done with the exact movements as used in reality, the mental attitude (i.e. imagination) should be the same as the real thing. (See first note below under ""Warnings"" and be sure to warm up before attempting this illusion.)

, If you are in an invisible box, you can press the air out in front of you with your hands, first your palm and then your fingers. Act as if you are trying to find a way out of this invisible box by identifying its corners and sides. Run one hand across the ""edges"" of your imaginary box, as you try to find the lid and your way out. If you want, you can eventually find the lid and flip it open dramatically with both arms, in a triumphant gesture.


Climb a ladder. To show climbing a ladder, grab at imaginary ladder rungs going up in the air. Place the ball of one foot on the ground, as you would put it on a ladder rung. Pull down on the rungs (keep the hands moving together!) as you go up on your toes, and then drop back down with the opposite foot now ""on a rung."" Alternate feet and hands each time you ""climb."" Keep your focus upwards, as though you were looking at the place to which you are climbing. (If it is a tall ladder, look downwards occasionally for comic effect - tilt your head slowly and carefully, just enough to look downwards, and then look forward quickly, with an expression of alarm!) Make your legs do the same movements as if your feet were clambering up a real ladder.
Do ""the lean"". Pretend to be leaning against a lamp post, wall or a counter. It might sound easy but takes quite a lot of strength and coordination to ""lean"" on nothing. The basic lean has two parts. Start with the feet about shoulder-width apart.
For the top part: Hold your arm slightly away from your body, with the elbow bent so that your forearm is parallel to the ground and your hand (wrist relaxed slightly) is near your torso. Now raise your shoulder as you move your chest towards your elbow (keeping the elbow at the same point in space!).
The bottom part: at the same time, bend your knee slightly, taking your weight onto the bent leg. The net effect should be that your elbow stays where it is, but it looks as though your weight has settled onto the imaginary place where your elbow rests. Make sure you only bend the leg under your raised arm. Keep your opposite leg perfectly straight as this adds to the illusion.
Watch yourself in a mirror, or use a video camera to see how effective the technique is. It's sometimes most effective to do this technique casually, with very little exaggeration at all.
For a more active show of leaning, the act can also incorporate stumbling, sliding off and missing the leaned-on object altogether.

, Pretend that it is very windy and that you are having a hard time standing up in it. Let the wind buffet you to and fro. For added amusement, include a struggle with an umbrella that keeps turning inside out

, It can very amusing to watch a mime of eating. Pretend to be consuming a very sloppy hamburger or hot dog, with all the contents slopping down the front of your clothing. Accidentally squirt some ketchup towards your eye. Or try peeling a banana and then slipping over on the peel.

, One of the icons of mime is the stationary walk. It also one of the most physically demanding feats. This walk reverses the pattern of actual walking. The ""trailing"" foot in the mime walk does not support any weight, but it represents the weight-bearing foot of a normal walk. This is why the leg must remain straight in the illusion - it appears to be bearing the weight. Here's how to do it.


It is very important to begin with a good posture. You should hold your abdomen in fairly tightly as it will be prone to moving when you're not paying attention. Keep your shoulders up and back - don't slouch, your chest and neck should be erect as well - not puffed out.
To begin, place your entire weight on the ball on one foot. This is your ""forward"" foot. Bend the knee over the forward foot slightly as you do this. With your other foot (the ""trailing"" foot) position the toes parallel to the toes of the forward foot. However, keep your trailing foot from touching the ground while maintaining the sole of the trailing foot parallel to the floor. Keep this leg perfectly straight.
With your forward foot, slowly lower your heel to the ground and straighten the leg. As you do this, move your trailing foot backwards while keeping the sole of the foot parallel to the ground and the leg straight - you should feel an intense stretch along the back of your leg. Push the trailing leg as far back as you can while maintaining all of the above qualities, and your balance.
Once the trailing foot is as far back as it can go, bring it back to parallel with your forward foot. Try to pick up the heel on your trailing foot first, like a natural step. Bend the your leg as you bring the trailing foot forward.
Now touch down with the ball of your trailing foot. If you look at your feet, they are now in an exact reverse of their starting position. The ""forward"" foot is now in the ""trailing"" position and vise versa.
The transition of weight between these feet is the most crucial aspect of the illusion! You must smoothly transfer weight from your former 'forward' foot to your new ""forward"" foot. At the same time, you must lift the newly freed foot and begin trailing it behind you. This will take quite a bit of practice to master.
With all of the activity in your feet, don't forget to move your upper body! Swing your arms so that the forward foot is always opposition to your forward hand. Also, inhale when you lift your trailing foot to come forward; exhale as you slide your trailing foot back.
If you don't bring your trailing foot back to parallel with your forward foot, you can simply transfer your weight to it and begin moonwalking!

, You can go for a one-off laugh, or you can try to raise mime to a higher art form. If you create a story from your mime, you will be engaging your audience and providing true artistic resonance to the art of miming. Think in advance of a ""tale"" you would like to tell. Keep in mind that mime can be very beautiful and moving if done well. To take some of the examples above:


It is a windy day (wind / umbrella mime) and you wish to walk to the hamburger stand where you meet a friend who has a cat stuck up a tree. Your friend asks you to climb the ladder to rescue the cat (ladder mime). When you return the cat (mime holding a squirming and ungrateful cat), your friend treats you to a hamburger (sloppy, ketchup mime) and just as you leave, you fail to notice a banana peel on the ground.
If you wish to mime something more serious, adopt a mood with your clothing, make-up and lighting. Think out a serious tale in advance. For instance, you may wish to highlight the plight of the homeless sleeping out in the cold during winter. Paint on a sad face, wear tattered clothing and use dim lighting. Think through a story that allows you to mime trudging despair as the homeless person seeks shelter for the night. Mime setting up a sleeping space under a bridge with only a cardboard box for a bed. Mime shivering and inability to sleep well. Project sadness to reflect the plight of this person.

, For example, you could use your arm as swinging doors to create the atmosphere that you intend."

Make your purchase.",How to Pick Tap Dance Shoes," If you're in kid's sizes, you'll want the shinier tap shoes. If you're in adult sizes or if you're in a more advanced class, you'll need leather tap shoes. Unfortunately, these are a lot more expensive than the shiny kid's ones. However, they last longer and make a better sound. Plus, they look a lot more professional.;
, What brands have good reviews? What brands have bad? Bloch is a great idea, for instance, because this brand makes more durable and well-working shoes.


Do not choose shoes who secure the metal on the bottom with just one screw. If that one screw comes even the least bit loose, you're in big trouble. Shoot for the ones with three screws, as these are better-suited in case the worst happens.

, If you order your shoes online and don't know the exact size you want, then there's a very high chance you're about to waste a lot of money. Remember that your street shoe size may not be the same as your tap shoe size.


Try for a local shoe store, especially a dance store. Try several different shoes, even if you feel that one pair is perfect, because there may be an even more perfect one on a shelf.

, The average price of a leather tap shoe is about $75, so don't go for something that's $20 or $30. Don't spend hundreds of dollars on tap shoes, either. Kid's tap shoes are typically $20 to $25, so compare that accordingly as well.

, Once you've found the right pair at the right price, hand over the cash and bring home your new pair of tappers. Congratulations!

If you’re not ready to buy tap dancing shoes, you can wear flat-soled dress shoes instead. Choose shoes that don’t have a ridge on the bottom.The metal plates on the bottom of tap shoes are called “taps.” More expensive tap shoes have taps that can create different tones.;
, Do an online search to find a tap dance studio in your area that meets your needs. For example, if you’re interested in performing or competing, find a studio that holds regular recitals or enters competitions. If you can’t find the information online, call the studio to ask questions about the tap dancing classes. For example:


Ask if the teacher has a bachelors degree in dance or dance education. This may be important if you want to become a competitive tap dancer.
Ask if the teacher performs or enters competitions. This will indicate whether or not the teacher is still an active dancer.
Find out if the instructor teaches any other types of dance classes. This may indicate that they’re not actually qualified to teach tap dancing., If there are no tap dance studios in your area, you can take an online class instead. However, you won’t improve as quickly without one-on-instruction. Additionally, if you live in an apartment complex, make sure you practice during the day so that you don’t keep your neighbors up with tapping noises.


Find free tap dancing lessons on Youtube.
Pay a small fee for a series of taped lessons from a variety of websites.
Pay an instructor to teach you one-on-one using webcams.

, First, bend your knees slightly. Extend one foot in front of you or to the side, keeping your leg straight. Lift your leg and tap the ball of your foot against the ground do to a “Toe Tap.”Continue tapping in time with the music. This will help you learn to tap rhythmically and listen to the music you’re dancing to.


Repeat this exercise with either foot until you feel comfortable tapping in time with the music.
You can tap dance to whatever song you’d like. However, if you use your favorite song, you won’t get tired of hearing it when you repeat the exercise.

, This is one of the most basic steps in tap dancing. First, stand with your feet together and your hands on your hips. Lift your right foot slightly. Keeping your heel raised, stomp down with the ball of your foot to create a clicking sound. Next, lower your heel sharply, keeping the ball of your foot pressed against the ground.Repeat the movement with your left foot.
Practice this movement until you can perform a Ball Heel with both feet.

, Stand with your feet together and your knees slightly bent. Next, raise yourself up so that you’re standing on the balls of your feet. Lift one foot, balancing all of your weight on the other. Step down sharply and shift your weight. Repeat this movement, rocking your weight back and forth between your feet.


Only the plates on the balls of your feet should touch the ground. Keep your heels in the air.
If you step forward or backwards while performing this move, you will do a “Step Ball Change.”, Stand on your left foot and bend your right leg behind you. Swing your right foot forward. As it passes your left leg, tap the ball of your foot against the ground. Swing it back, repeating the tapping motion. Finish the movement by stomping your foot back on the ground next to your resting foot. Repeat the motion with your other leg.Don’t let your heel touch the floor while you swing your feet.
Keep your knees slightly bent while shuffling. This will help you move your feet more quickly.

, Raise your right foot up slightly. Drop your heel onto the floor next to your resting foot. Next, drop the ball of your foot down sharply. Repeat the motion with your other foot.This move is easier if you’re wearing heels instead of flat-footed shoes.
You can either move in place or slowly walk forward.

, You can either learn an advanced move from your instructor or invent your own at home. Most complicated tap dancing moves are made up of a combination of shorter, simpler moves.When learning the advanced move, break it down into a series of smaller, basic steps. Once you learn these steps, you will know the advanced dance move.


Write down the sequence of basic steps on a notepad or piece of scrap paper. This will help you remember how to do the dance move.
Practice transitioning between the smaller steps. If you transition smoothly enough, the basic steps will come together and look like one long complicated dance move.

, While learning a difficult move, dance very slowly. Focus on mastering each step and learning the full routine. As you become more comfortable with the dance move, gradually speed up. If you have a solid understanding of the dance move, you will be able to perform it more quickly.


This method is also important for learning basic dance moves. A good understanding of the basics will give you a solid foundation for the more difficult dance moves.

, If you want to improve, watch talented tap dancers perform. This will give you an opportunity to learn their moves and adopt their styles. For example, watch famous tap dance groups perform if they come to your area. Alternatively, watch famous movies with great tap dancers or watch their routines on Youtube. Examples of famous tap dancers include:


Bill “Bojangles” Robinson in “The Little Colonel” (1935)
The Nicholas Brothers in “Stormy Weather” (1943)
Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell in “Broadway Melody of 1940” (1940), If you want to get good at something, you must practice. If you’re taking classes at a studio, see if they offer practice times. During these times, the studio will be open to any students who want to practice independently. If your studio doesn’t offer practice times, you may have to practice at home.


If you live in an apartment complex, make sure to practice during the day. Otherwise, your tap dancing may keep your neighbors awake at night.

Keep your weight on your toes.,
Hold your core.",How to Maintain Body Posture in Tap Dance," This is a common problem for ballet dancers, who spend years turning out. While some steps, such as buffalo, dictate that the feet stay turned out, the majority of tap steps have your feet slightly apart and facing forwards.;
, Most of the time, you don't want to be stiff as a stick, as it can do some damage to your knees and generally ruin the natural flow of tap dance. While you don't want to be slouching, keeping your weight forward on your toes will help you to balance and to move more quickly.

, This is extremely important, as keeping your legs straight can do serious damage to your knees, ankles, and movements in general. Any time you're tap dancing, unless your teacher specifically instructs you to keep your knees straight during a certain step or combination, have your knees slightly bent and relaxed.

, Tap is one of the few types of dance that doesn't tend to have specific arms for combinations. Unless your teacher instructs you on how to do your arms, you'll want to keep them simple. Some great places to rest them are at your hips or simply by your sides, but tap allows you to let your arms go where they want to go if you don't want to keep them in one place alone.

, When you're leaning forwards and have your knees bent, it's common to make the mistake of looking as if you're squatting. Although you do want to have your weight forwards, and you don't want to have your knees locked, don't do them both to such a drastic measure that you're almost sitting on the air.

, It's very important to not put too much pressure on your ankles. This can be very hard in tap dance, but there are some things you can do to keep it relaxed. Point, flex, and rotate your feet, and never forget to stretch your ankles along with everything else before class to avoid injury.

, This goes hand in hand with leaning forwards, but even when you're instructed to stand up straight, you must keep your weight on your toes. With the constant flow of quick steps, almost all of which have the weight on the toes, leaning backwards and putting your weight on your heels for even a second can completely throw you off balance.

, This is a shorter way of saying to keep your ribs closed, your abs engaged, and your weight up. Don't puff out your chest like a proud Momma Duck or keep your abdomen overly relaxed, as it will kill your balance. This can take months and even years of practice to naturally do, but once you find your center and learn to hold your core, maintaining tap posture will be noticeably easier, and your dance will greatly benefit.

, Double pull backs are just two backward flaps in a row, so work on doing alternating backward flaps., Find a surface to lean on, such as a ballet barre or table, and do single pull backs there., A double pull back is two consecutive backward flaps - in other words, a right spank, a left spank, a right touch, and a left touch. It's essentially a pull back with the timing slightly off. While at your surface, try doing two pullbacks and then the double., You will very rarely get a step down on your first few tries, and often, it takes a week or two for new steps to ""click"" with your feet.

Practice your shuffle.,

Continue practicing toward every direction.",How to Do a Shuffle in Tap Dancing2," Once you have the hang of the shuffle, a key element to add is shuffling in different directions; however, you can't do that if you don't have your shuffle down!

, This is about what you did in the previous part - brush your foot directly forward, then directly back. Repeat with your other leg.

, Shuffling to the side is a bit tricky to learn, as you aren't quite shuffling directly to the side; rather, you're shuffling a few inches in front of where that would be (think of shuffling to west-northwest and east-northeast). Shuffle out toward this diagonal, then back toward you. Repeat with the other leg.

, This is the hardest direction, and some teachers don't even teach this direction to beginners for a year or two. To shuffle to the back, you'll need to bend your standing leg somewhat and brush to the back more toward the inside of the ball of your foot, rather than the whole surface. This shuffle isn't directly toward the back, either - rather a few inches away from it (south-southeast and south-southwest, essentially). Practice this with both legs.

, Shuffling in different directions can be tricky to learn, but it's a major component of tap that will be useful for many years to come.

If you don't have friends or colleagues with agents, find a local community of actors and get to know them. They can help you get your reel and headshots to the right person.
You will also need a recommendation to get an agent, so it is key to have someone put in a good word for you who is familiar or has professional relationship with a particular agent.;
, Even if it volunteer or low paying, or part of your school activities. You might get noticed by an agent. Take every opportunity to act as it comes along. Whether it's a play, a student film, a documentary, a commercial etc. Anything like this can get your work seen and out there!
If you are talented, word will get out that you have special qualities that might be desirable in the industry.
Agents and mangers go to plays and watch videos that are recommended to them. You might be the next person to get discovered through even a minor project.
Any of these opportunities provide you with a way to hone your craft. Any experience can be helpful.

, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube can give you amazing exposure through friend and business networks. Be very careful when approaching an agent over social media.
Don't be overzealous or seem desperate. This can turn off a potential business relationship.
A good rule of thumb is to think about what you put on social media for this potential agent to see. If you wouldn't want them to hear it or see it in person, you shouldn't post it.
The best way to engage with an agent over Facebook or Twitter is to participate in conversation by showing common interests and showing them your content.
If they don't respond to you, don't continue to berate them with audition tapes or headshots. This can sour your relationship with other agents, as these people have very close business networks.

, Agents sometimes hold these to find new talent. Keep in mind that these are highly competitive.
You will want to stand out from the crowd. Don't be shy but be careful you don't appear as too arrogant or odd.
Make sure you look professional and unique. First impressions are key in the film and theater industry.

, Once you've made a contact and you get to know an agent, it is best to set up a formal meeting. While you might have a unique look and be confident in your appearance, your resume and reel won't make themselves.
Show up prepared to discuss your experiences and interests.
Your job now is to convince the agent that you are worth their valuable time. You have to let your work show.
Don't show up at a meeting expecting an agent to pluck you out of obscurity if you don't have the experience to back it up.

, An agent or manager will help find auditions or castings for you.If you hire an agent, after getting your job you have to pay them a percentage of your salary.

Theater auditions and castings are often published in theater magazines or local newspapers.
Look in major newspapers for large cities. You will have better luck finding opportunities in large metropolitan areas with big entertainment industries.

, Facebook is a great resource for getting auditions. Event pages are often used to announce open casting calls and auditions. These can be a good resource for both film, tv, and theater.
Look at agents pages or find specific project pages on Facebook. Sometimes, audition information will be posted there.
You can also find casting calls and auditions on Twitter and Craigslist.
You might have more luck finding auditions and acting opportunities if you live closer to a large city with an entertainment industry.

, At first go to the sites, sign up and post your head shots. Some examples of these sites include www.exploretalent.com, www.laauditions.com, www.actoraccess.com, or www. backstage.com.
Make sure your profile is distinct, detailed, and has multiple headshots.
Most of these sites will send you emails or alerts when a project is holding auditions or open casting for a part.
Be wary of using these sites as your only resource. Many of them charge a fee with minimal return.
These can be a very good tool for researching projects that are happening locally.

,
Most films that are looking for extras will advertise through your city's film office.
The film office will also have a list of current projects, permits and contacts. This can help you do some more research and contact casting directors.
The film office might also offer information on acting classes and workshops to allow you to practice your craft.

Don't put down your heels.,
Keep practicing.,
Try double pullbacks.,
Try one-footed pullbacks.",How to Do Pullbacks in Tap Dance," A pullback is two simultaneous backward flaps, so you'll need to know how to flap backwards.;
, This can be a ballet barre, a table, or any other surface that can support your weight.

, You'll want to do only one at a time to start with. Stand with your heels on the ground. Then, lean back and balance on your heels. Finally, flap backward with both feet at once. This will seem nearly impossible at first, but keep trying, and be sure to use your leaning surface as needed to help out.

, Try going through the process more quickly once you catch the concept. Instead of balancing on your heels, just shift your weight onto them before you pull back.

, Once you feel that you can do pullbacks well, try doing one, then putting your heels back down and doing another. Repeat this process for as long as you can slowly.

, Try doing several with nothing to rely on. Start slowly and increase your speed as needed.

, You'll have to be quite comfortable with pullbacks to be ready for this, but once you reach that point, just do the pullback without putting down your heels between each one. This is often easier at a higher tempo than lower, so try doing it quickly first.

, The more you practice, the more quickly you'll pick everything up. You may spend only a few days learning pullbacks, and you may spend several years mastering the technique, but keep at it.

, These are pullbacks with more separated flaps.

, It's the same concept as a simple pullback, but it involves keeping one foot entirely off the ground and doing pullbacks with the other.

Call the director, if you saw a flyer for it, then the number is usually on it, if you heard from a friend, ask them.,
Make sure you schedule your Time and Date so you don't forget.,
When the day comes, look your best and get to the theater ON TIME or EARLY.,
The director will normally talk to the kids before having them sing.

Sing your best, and don't be shy!,

Read loud and clear.,
When the audition is over, you can go home, if you get cast the director will call you.,
If you get a part and you don't want it talk to the director and tell them nicely.

",How to Audition for a Play if You're a Kid," You might want to go on the theaters website.;
, If you need a song prepared, get it. You usually won't have to sing a long one, so sing a short song, but make sure it's from a musical! That way the director will see your passion for theatre! Don't sing anything like 'Happy Birthday', though, because everyone knows that song. It will come across to the director that you did not prepare for the audition.], Actors need to be punctual, show the director that you can do anything he/she needs you to do.

,, If you are, just look at one place in the place you're auditioning for the play, and focus on that, that will make you forget about everything, and it'll make your voice get louder.

Memorize your Monologue: If you're choosing a monologue to perform at an audition, make sure you know it so well you could recite in a year or even two years from now.,
Understand the Monologue: As an actor, avoid picking a monologue where you have no clear recognition of the play its from.,
Nail your Body Language: Body language consists of arm movement, walking or pacing, hand gestures, eye contact and facial expressions.,
The Slate: Slating, is simply, saying your name and what you are performing and from what play.,
Fight Stage Fright: Nope, not just common.,
5 Minutes Before: Relax, even as it is one of those, 'Easy to say, hard to do' type things, if you just let yourself fall back and rejuvenate your energy, you will do your best.",How to Ace Your Acting Audition," Instead of receptive readings of it to ""memorize"" it, ingrain it in your memory by taking it apart and developing a deeper understanding of the piece itself. Then, recite it as best as you can anywhere you can. Grocery shopping? Time to recite Titania's speech in Act 1. Taking a walk? Perfect time to recite a piece from Circle Mirror Transformation. You get the point. The only thing is, make sure you know it. If you mess up while practicing, CORRECT YOURSELF, and start from the beginning. Avoid forming habits by saying the wrong words!;
, To perform well, you need to understand the characters motives, who they're talking to, where they are, and what they are emotionally experiencing. Although it may not be written in the speech itself, it will help you unconsciously develop a persona for your character. This means that without knowing it, you will develop that character in your head and feel the same emotions that they do. So, in short, read the play, and find out exactly what's going on in THEIR head before attempting to put it in yours.

, Performing a monologue should not be reciting words. It should be a vibrant display and representation of the character! So get really into the character, and practice body language they might use.


ARM MOVEMENT: This type of body language should come naturally into your performance without you even realizing it. If not, find out why. Do you really know this monologue, or are you just repeating words without finding meaning?
WALKING/PACING: There may be an 'X' in duct tape to mark where to stand. It's like in a board game the spot that marks, 'START'. This is where you slate your name and begin. But don't stay there, make, what I call, ""Motion with Motives"". Don't aimlessly pace around in a circle. If you're going left, there is a reason. If you're pacing, there is a reason. It all encircles what's going through the characters mind.
EYE CONTACT: Do. Not. Stare. Down. That. Wall! Naturally, when people talk to another, 90% of the time they look around, imagining what they are describing. They also, 10% of the time, make eye contact with the listener to see if their paying attention, their reactions, etc. This is not a solid rule, this can EASILY change based on the monologue, so use your smarts and decide how you are going to use this vital skill.
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS: This, like Arm Movement, comes with natural emotion. If you feel something, really feel an emotion, it will show on your face.

, The auditors may ask you to say other things like your age/grade, union/nonunion, etc. You're probably thinking it's not a big deal. But it is. First of all, the auditors will judge. Your eye contact, body posture, appearance, body language, way of slating... you name it, they will judge it. Just remember: Be different, Be confident, and Be happy. Be different, and instead of saying the typical, ""Hello, My name is... I will be doing...."" Say, ""Hey, Everyone! How are you! My name is...and I will be performing for you ....."" They've seen tons already, so make yours stand out. Be confident & Be happy: If you're not confident in your own shoes, how do they expect you to be confident in someone else's? Relax. You have total control over them, not the other way around.

, Everybody has it. Even if they say, ""Ah, I've gotten over that years ago!"" It's just to make you feel intimidated, usually. Stage fright is something interwoven in human DNA. A rush of adrenaline and other chemicals cause you to shake, be more aware, have cramps, tense muscles, and other reactions. This is fear, and you're body is preparing you to do something life endangering. Unfortunately, this will not help your performance, and will make your memory unreliable. Jog or stretch to relax your muscles, and unless absolutely necessary, don't run over your lines. This will only feed the fear. Do some vocal warm ups, and drink some hot tea. Feel-good carbs, like pasta, is easy to digest so it will make cramps and stomach aches unlikely. Most of all, be confident and smile!

, Stay confident, and remember, you are not at the mercy of the auditors! You are not pleading for food from the Royals or begging for money. They are, in a way, at the mercy of you. During your two minute run, you can do anything to captivate their emotions and revive their spirit. You are simply selling your acting ability, and they are buying which ever they choose. Ultimately, you have more control over it than they do. So have fun with it, and be what you aspire to be!

Get to know your voice.,
Play your recordings for friends and family.,
Choose an appropriate voice-over field.,
Practice reading out loud.,
Study the script.",How to Ace a Voice‐Over Audition1," Get a set of different scripts and record yourself reading each one. Then, play back what you've recorded and do a self-evaluation. Identify which type of script makes you feel most natural while recording in addition to which ones sound the best when played back.;
, Ask them to identify the most and least effective recordings. Use their feedback to help determine where you really excelled.

, There is demand for even the most unique voices, so don't lose hope if you can't match the clear, deep voice on your voicemail machine. Use your unique qualities to your advantage! Voice-overs can be broken into the following three types:



Straight Narration - Requires a very clear voice. Some scripts call for emotionally neutral narrators while others call for narrators that are emotionally involved. If you have an authoritative and clear voice, this is a good field for you.

Voice Acting - This field assigns your voice to a character. As a result, it requires unique voices with personality, accents, and attitude. As a voice actor, you may be asked to do the voice for a video game character or for an audio book.

Commercials - Calls for a narrator who can deliver the script in a very strict time limit. While it's important that the message be clear, the type of voice is less important than speed here.

, Overall the most important factor in being a great voice-over artist is being able to read aloud clearly, deliver the lines effectively, identify the main message of the script, and communicate that message naturally. Practice reading ahead while talking so that you do not stumble over your words come the big day.

, If you're lucky enough to receive the script beforehand, make sure you are extremely familiar with both the words and the message that the script is trying to convey. Find out which words work best with emphasis, and practice reading with different tones, speeds, and emotion. Once you find something that works best, practice it as much as you can in the days (or even weeks!) leading up to the audition.

Study the script.,
Don't cave under pressure.",How to Ace a Voice‐Over Audition2," If you got the script beforehand, great. You should have already studied and practiced it. If you're seeing the script for the first time, take a couple minutes to read through it. Find the main message. With that message in mind, think about how you want to deliver the script. Practice reading out loud if you can.

, Besides the high stress of auditioning for a job, a lot of companies will purposely heckle you to see how to respond under pressure. Stay cool, calm, and collected, and follow any directions you are given, even if you think you know better.

Arrive to the audition about fifteen minutes earlier than you're expected.,
Dress casually.,
Apply light makeup.,
Don't forget deodorant!,
At the audition, keep to yourself.,
Consider doing breathing exercises.,
When speaking to the directors or any other actors, always be polite and friendly.,
Unless the audition requires a cold reading, and you know exactly what you're auditioning for, get into character before you even get on stage.",How to Act Properly During an Audition," Not only does this show commitment to the directors, but will also give you some time to prepare. There is, of course, exceptions. Sometimes, auditions are held directly after the final bell, so leaving class early to go to your audition is impossible.;
, This doesn't mean waltz in to auditions with a baggy sweatshirt and Mickey Mouse pajamas. And don't dress up like you are going to a pageant. Just wear what you would wear to school, or to a lunch with friends. Wear a reasonably form-fitting, bright-colored shirt, some fitted jeans, and cute shoes. For men, some nice, dark jeans and a fitted sweater is recommended.

, Don't overdo it and end up looking like a drag queen, but some cover up for those pesky pimples, some shadow to bring out your eyes and a nice lip gloss. Avoid blue or green eye shadow, which is distracting to the judges, and choose light purple or brown. School play auditions are usually held directly after school in most places.

If you're a girl, by the time you get to your audition, your make-up wears off. On the day of the audition, pack the makeup that you used that morning into a purse or your book bag.

, If during the audition you're required to lift your arms, the directors will NOT like to look at your nasty pit stains. About fifteen minutes before the final bell rings and you're to go to your audition, shove the stored makeup into your pockets, and ask to go to the bathroom. If your teacher isn't teaching the class, explain your situation to them and you won't be questioned why you took ten minutes in the bathroom when you get back to class.


When you get to the bathroom and you happen to have makeup remover with you, use that instead of just caking on another layer of makeup. Reapply your makeup and deodorant, and head back to class.

, If you see some friends across the room, don't go over to chat with them. You need this time to prepare. This doesn't mean to act stand-offish or unfriendly, but don't waste your time gossiping with friends or comparing head shots with your fellow actors.

, Breath deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. For anxiety, breathe in as deep as you can, hold it for five seconds, and release. If your audition requires singing and there happens to be a piano or something in the room, do NOT be afraid to ask the pianist or one of the directors or something if they could go through some vocal warm-ups with you. They should be accommodating, and it will only help you in the long-run. You don't want to go up there to sing and not be warmed up.

, Avoid nervous habits like hiding your hands in your sleeves or pockets, or gnawing on your fingernails. You want to appear confident to the directors and your fellow actors (but never cocky) so good posture and a smile is always important.

, Don't think any thoughts that the character themselves would not think. When you're auditioning, refrain of thinking anything that's going to make you nervous. If you mess up, go on as if it never happened.

Keep going to auditions to get better and get more roles.",How to Audition," Look on the website to see what the directors are looking for from the audition. When auditioning for a theater company, make sure you know some background information (past shows, date established, awards won, etc.) on the company. The casting people will be pleased to hear something different than ""Not much"" if they ask you what you know about the company. Some things to look for include:



Overview of the show/event: If you can, learn as much about the play, commercial or scene as possible. Being able to talk convincingly about why you want the part.

The Director/Casting Agent: You're not going to get details on their personal life, but the

Your Role Are you supposed to be funny? Dark and serious? Oftentimes this is said up front, but you may need to do some character research, especially if it is a play or event that's already been shown.

The Logistics: When are you needed for practice or performances? Nothing hurts your reputation like earning a role, but turning it down because you can't actually play the part.;
, Know that, in the room, it is okay to check your notes every now and then, but you'll always be more convincing if you have the words mostly memorized. This lets you focus more on acting and less on reading. If the audition requires you to memorize a monolog, make sure you have it completely memorized and are ready to act it out.


If the part has multiple characters, get a few friends to practice with you. While you could just practice your lines, having someone to help with timing and reactions will make you much stronger.
Don't just read the lines blindly -- pick a way to read the lines (cold, happy, funny, depressed, professional, etc.) that fits the character and practice reading the script in this tone.
All good monologues have movement -- meaning the character is in a different place emotionally than when they finish than when they started talking. If you can practice this transition the role is yours., A cold read is when the crew give you a piece to audition that you've never read and has you perform it on the spot. Cold reads are tricky, but just remember that everyone starts from scratch, too. The best way to nail a cold read is to practice -- grab a book of monologues, pick one at random, and just start acting. You can even practice with magazine or newspaper articles.


Focus first on reading each word clearly and calmly. Your first goal is to make sure all the lines get out clearly.
When given a cold read, pick a mood or tone and just roll with it. Don't try to get the perfect mood, just trust your guts and commit.

, You don't want to yawn or have your stomach rumble during the audition. If you are singing, avoid dairy, caffeine or anything else that you know will dry out your voice or cause phlegm.


If this audition includes singing or speaking it is recommended to stay away from chocolate and dairy products that will make your mouth too moist. Instead, try to drink some warm tea with lemon and honey.

, Aim to look professional and make a good first impression. A clean buttoned shirt and jeans or a plain dress are good choices. Don't try to make a statement or match the character's clothing -- your goal is to blend into the character before their eyes, and the more unique your clothing, the harder this will be.


Some auditions require dance, so wear something comfortable to move in.
For shoes, you can wear running shoes or flats. Make sure you're comfortable! Also, if there is dancing, you may want to bring jazz or character shoes.

, For example, even if you think the character would look better blond/brunette, etc., don't dye your hair or cut it. Many things can be done to ""reshape"" you later if they think this is necessary. If you'd like, add your willingness to make changes on your written audition paper, but don't do something radical before you've even gotten the part. At best, you'll make it a little easier on the makeup department if you get the part, but at worst you'll present a version of the character that doesn't even match the directors, instantly losing the part.


If you are underage, ask your parent or guardian if it's okay for you to make changes should you get the role. Don't just ""assume"" that your super cool mom will say yes. There is nothing worse than having an angry director because your parents wouldn't let you do the thing you said you would.

, Read the notice for the audition and make sure to check out any scripts or contracts you're sent fully. If this is your first audition, know that the procedure is pretty simple. You check in when you arrive, and will be called in when it is your turn. There may be one person watching you, there could be five, but they will all be kind and supportive. Depending on the audition, you may be asked to:


Deliver your prepared monologue
Perform a song of your choosing
Cold read a brand new scene or monologue
Improvise line with others, Do not approach them to talk unless invited or it is an emergency -- many actors like quiet time to prepare for the role before they go in. In general, it's best not to talk at all, lest you lose focus before you go before the auditioners. Bring a copy of the script or a monologue and brush up on your materials -- you never know what you'll find.

, When your name is called, walk in with a hello and a smile. Don't fidget, ask for advice, or creep in with hesitation -- you're there to command an audience's attention, and the casting crew is the first audience you have. Be sure to make eye contact, act friendly, and seem like a nice person to work with. Act like you're meeting new coworkers -- cordial and kind but still professional.


Don't bother asking for advice or direction -- if they have some, they'll give it.
Do not try to make too much conversation with the casting officials; they have others auditioning, too.
If the auditioners ask you if you are nervous, respond no. Instead, say that you are excited. This way, you seem more confident that you may actually be.

, Most auditions have a small home movie camera set up to record all of the auditions, which allows the director to rewatch when making her final decision. Once you've taken your place, plant your feet and keep them there. While you can move slightly to be expressive, you'll show true professionalism if you stay on camera., Don't ask for apologies or do-overs -- once get going, let yourself fall back on your practice and training. If you miss a word or need a quick pause, that is okay. What is most important is not to say ""sorry,"" ""can I try that again,"" or ""let me have a do-over."" Casting directors aren't just looking for the role, they are looking for a serious, professional co-worker, and this confidence will put you ahead of many other actors who are worried about being ""perfect.""


If the casting director wants to see another take, they'll ask, so don't fret and worry that you blew your own chance on a missed word they may not have noticed.

, This doesn't mean you always start with a smile and end with tears. It simply means you find an arc, however small, in your character's role. A good scene, song, or commercial ends in a different place then it started, and your job as an actor is to help show this. All roles are different, but there are some common ways to show growth:



Rising Emotion: Basically, you let your energy grow as the scene does, which makes the ending the most energetic or momentous moment of the audition. This can help you both selling cars in a commercial or expressing your passion for an unrequited love.

Sudden Turn or Realization: Find the line or moment when your character seems to shift gears, ideas, or emotions. This line is often the most crucial of the whole audition, as it requires you to naturally shift your acting from one emotion or the other.

Shift and change your body language: Maybe your character is under pressure in the scene and they slowly start to fidget more. Maybe, as they keep talking, they grow confident, sitting up straighter and straighter as they go.

, Some auditions have another person in the room with you, a casting agent who acts out other roles in the play to see how you handle dialogue. No matter who is helping you, give them everything you've got as if you were acting across from Meryl Streep.


Never blame a reader for a tough audition. Like most people trying to act, they will only give back as much energy as you give them. If you're in the role and committed, they will be too., Don't try to change your game plan last minute after seeing another actor, or because you suddenly feel like you are wrong the role. Remember that your confidence and practice are more important than reading a director's mind, and you'll only get in your own head if you show up to please someone. Trust yourself and your choices and focus on you. The rest will fall into place.

, If you did not get the part, job, or whatever you were trying out for, be gracious to the director or other casting officials. They had to see and reject many others just like you. It doesn't mean that you are any less talented than the person who got the job, sometimes it just comes down to something as simple as your height or way you move. If you like, you could ask them why they rejected you to see how you could improve.


Stay pleasant. You never know when the initial casting might go wrong or they need someone extra and they remember the very gracious, pleasant you who was ranked number 2 selection on their list. Don't do anything to sour the good impression that they had of you; always leave the doors wide open.
There are many different reasons why you might not get a part, but it is rarely ""your fault."" Directors often have specific ideas in mind for their characters, and it's not your fault if you don't fit them.

, Oftentimes, casting directors have general monologues that they like to get a feel for actors, even if you are (unknowingly) auditioning for different parts. Other times you'll try out for a part and do well, but will fit better for another role. If you get your heart set on one particular role it may be hard to get ready for a different part. However, you should be thankful for and approach any role you're given with professionalism. The casting director clearly saw something in you that they like., You never know when a director is looking for someone just like you for another project. Many casting directors like to keep records of actors they like, building relationships even if this particular part isn't right to you.

, Call-backs are a way to winnow down the field. 100 people may try out for the first round, but only 10 may be called back for a second round. If you get called back, be sure to prepare new material to perform, preferably showing a slightly different side of yourself and not a similar monologue to the last one, Even if you are sure that you will not get the job, there is no harm in going to an audition just to practice auditioning. It is almost impossible to get the job every time, so why not practice for when that show or spot in the company finally opens up? You are more likely to get in if you have more experience under your belt. Eventually, you are sure to be cast in something!

Think about the location, if you are ready for the commitment, etc. Ask your drama or music teacher at school if he/she knows of any upcoming auditions in your area.;
, Some of them want taped background music, others piano accompaniment. Make sure you have the right shoes. Most importantly, make sure you fit the roles. Most companies offer a list of roles, so you can be prepared.

, Don't choose the same old song that the directors have heard a million times. By choosing a new and fresh song, the directors are more interested then they would be in another kid singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"".

, You must know it like the back of your hand if you are to ace the audition. Don't be afraid to put your own spin on it. Directors like when performers show they are creative and can be individual.

,, Remember: You are like a salesman trying to sell a product, only you are selling your talent. You want to make sure you look your very best. Make sure you wear clothes you can move in, and have your hair styled in a way that the focus is on your face, not your hair.

, Directors are not looking for someone who doesn't think they're good enough. They want a kid who is confident and gives off the message that you believe you have what it takes. When you stand up to read or sing, give a winning smile and look right at the directors. If you believe you're right for the part, they will too.

, Nothing turns off a director like a conceited actor. Acting like you are above everyone else or refusing to listen will give off the message that you are stubborn and hard to work with. Directors are not only looking for an ability, but also the way you behave in general. So don't be a snob.

, If something in the script, sheet music, or dance combination confuses you, don't be afraid to ask the director for some tips. That's what they are there for. Wanting to be completely sure of how they want it will assure them you genuinely care about making the play the best it can be.

, You will probably hear back from the company in about two weeks. So do not spend two weeks being anxious and worried. Do what you normally do and get plenty of sleep.

, It's just one play. Maybe they didn't think any of the parts really fit your talent and personality. It doesn't always mean you are not good enough. Just keep trying and one of those times you will get in. If you truly can not handle the rejection, try a different hobby. Jennifer Hudson lost American Idol but went on to win an Academy Award. Sometimes you have to take a wrong turn to get on the right track.

Crouch on the ground on your knees.,

Lift your left leg while kicking your right leg under.,
Catch the hang-glide position again.,
Swing your left leg around and repeat the process.,
Improve your technique.,
Do a power windmill.,
Do a halo.",How to Windmill," Before you do the windmill, you have to get down on the floor. This can help you position your hands correctly so you can support yourself as your legs start spinning. As you get ready to place your hands down, your head can be out in front of you, just a few inches from the ground.;
, You should already be comfortable and familiar with this position if you want to be able to do the windmill. To do this right, you just have to place your left elbow between your waist and rib cage, and your right hand diagonally up and to the right of your left hand. The fingers of your right hand should be pointing straight away from you, while the fingers of your left hand should be pointing to your left side, so they make a right angle with your right fingers.









The hang-glide is a version of a freeze, which is a technique that involves halting body motion, in order to make it look like you're literally ""freezing"" in the air. This is similar to the turtle freeze, except in the turtle freeze, both elbows are stabbed into your gut instead of just one.
Some people also call this move the ""crab freeze.""

, This will get you in the position you need to be in to start swinging your legs around. You should already have the strength to lift up your legs a bit, as if you're going to go into the handstand position. Now, your legs will be ready to spin around counter-clockwise.









You can also do this move in reverse, placing your right elbow into your gut and your left hand out, in order to move clockwise.

, Now, dig that left elbow into your gut and really push off of that right leg to get your left leg swinging up and counter-clockwise, so it cuts the air at a 45 degree angle as it moves up. This leg will wind up and will generate the power and momentum to get your right leg swinging forward. Your knee should be bent a bit, so it's easier for you to move your leg. If your leg is too straight, you'll have less control.









As your legs move up higher, your front body and head will move down lower close to the ground, because your weight will be balancing. You'll need to maintain a strong center of gravity to keep your head from falling too close to the ground or from not having enough height to get your legs up.
Though you should know and master the hang-glide position before you start swinging your legs around, you can actually keep that left elbow away from your gut until you start swinging that leg around. Once you kick that left leg, you can then place the elbow into your gut, so you have more height when you begin the kick. Some people do start in the hang-glide position, so it's up to you to see what works best.

, Now, the power from your left leg should have given your right leg enough power to start swinging forward in front of it. The right leg should dip down a bit as the left leg swings forward, and then it should naturally rise up. This may seem a little confusing because you'd expect the leg in front to move forward first, but you need that back left leg to generate momentum for the right leg.









Your right leg should also be bent a bit as it swings in front of your left leg.
Keep in mind that, while they say that your legs are in a ""V"" shape, in a true windmill, the legs are actually further apart and can even approach more of a straight line than a v-shape, if you get enough momentum going, so they almost look like helicopter blades.

, Now, that left leg will actually swing under that right leg, almost like a scissor, as you turn over and begin to collapse. To collapse, roll off your left hand and on to your left forearm. Move to your left shoulder and then to your back.









To collapse, your left elbow will move out of your gut and your forearm will bend along your tricep. This will help get your hand out of the way as you move onto your back.

, At the same time, roll onto your right shoulder and get back into the hang-glide position. This may be the trickiest part. Essentially, you have to generate enough momentum to get back to the position you started from so you can do the windmill again and again. If you don't generate enough momentum, you'll be stuck on your back without enough speed to roll onto your hands again.









You can work on getting one cycle really down at first a bit more slowly, because to keep repeating the process, you'll have to really generate a lot of speed and momentum, and that can be hard when you're just learning the ropes.

, As you roll onto your back, use your left hand to push the floor away from you to make it easier to turn back onto your side, then, as your left arm swings over your side, you'll be pressed onto your right forearm, which you can use to push your body up a bit to get closer to the starting position.









Then, you'll turn back onto your chest, pushing the floor away with your hands, and will angle your stomach back onto your left elbow with your left hand under it and your right arm out, just as you did the first time.
Getting in a stable hang-glide position again is crucial to maintaining your momentum and keeping your balance as you repeat the windmill. If you don't have a solid foundation, you won't be able to swing your legs around without getting off-kilter.

, Once you've got the basics of the windmill down, then you can start all over again and work on really getting it down. When you're ready to stop, you can practice stopping on your left hand and then twisting at your waist with your legs bent. When you first start out, you may only be able to do one or two windmills in a row, but the more you do it, the more you'll be able to do without losing your momentum or balance.









You can also transition into another move, like the backspin, if you want.

, As you get more comfortable with the windmill, you can work on gaining flow, smoothness, and creating a complete motion with the windmill. At first, you may think of it as a move that is done step-by-step, but when you really get it down, you'll start to see it as one smooth motion.


You can work on practicing your kick and really getting a good whip with that left leg.

, A power windmill still requires you to move your legs around, but you'll be rotating on your head instead of using your hands. This will be harder, but it will allow you to try different moves with your hands to mix things up. If you're comfortable pivoting on your head and trying the power windmill, then here are some tricks you can add to your repertoire:



The Genie. In this power windmill, you cross your hands over your chest.

The Confusion. Here, you'll place your hands over your face.

The Eggbeater. In this variation, you can place your hands on your thighs.

The Lotus. For this move, you'll do a windmill with your legs in the lotus position.

, Once you feel like your windmill is really up to speed, then you can try to do a halo, which is an even more advanced move. The halo is similar to the windmill because you'll still be using your arms and chest to support you as your legs spin around, but in the halo, your legs will swing much closer to the floor instead of at an angle, or they can go in the opposite direction, moving more and more vertically until it looks like you're doing a headspin.


You can think of it as a ""halo"" because your legs will be moving so fast that you'll be doing one unified move.

Learn basic breakdancing terminology.,
Try a basic three step.,
Learn the coffee grinder.,
Practice the baby freeze.,
Do a six step.",How to Teach Yourself to Breakdance1," A breakdance routine is compiled of three basic types of moves: top rocks, footwork, and freezes. Learn the basic terminology, and how these moves fit into your typical breakdance routine.Top rocks incorporate the top half of your body. You would use your arms, hands, elbows, and chest when performing top rocks moves. Top rocks are used as an introduction to a breakdancing routine. You would start off your routine by engaging in some top rocks before moving on to more advanced moves.Footwork involves moving with the lower half of your body. This involves using your feet, legs, and hips to dance. Footwork usually looks far more complex than top rocks, so you would transition into footwork later in a dance routine.Freezes are an important aspect of a breakdancing routine. If you think of breakdancing as a work of prose, freezes are the periods at the end of each sentence. When you finish one move in breakdancing, you should do a freeze. This means temporarily stopping movement before moving on to a second move.;
, One of the easiest form of footwork in breakdancing is a three step. You can use a three step to transition into many more complex moves down the road. If you're starting out as a breakdancer, learn the three step first.


Start off in a crab walk position. This means you place your arms behind you and your legs in front of you, bending your legs at the knees. Lift your body slightly off the ground.Move one foot forward, keeping the other leg down and supporting your body. Pull the leg that's down inside your body, using this leg to change your position. You should be standing on all fours, with your hands and feet on the ground. This is similar to the position you would be in to do a push-up, but your body is raised higher off the ground.Now, you can begin your three steps. Take your left leg and kick it out to your side, so you're supporting your weight with your right leg and arms. This is step one. Then, switch which leg is stretched out. Pull your left leg back up to the knee and kick out your right leg. This is step two. Then, move your right leg back under your body, returning to the push-up position you were in earlier., A coffee grinder is another basic footwork move. It's also known as the helicopter or propeller. In this move, you'll spin around while crouching near the ground. The coffee grinder is a very common move in breakdancing routines.


To start, crouch near the ground. If you've ever done crunches as part of a workout routine, this is the position you would be in at the bottom of a crunch. Then, swing your right leg out to your side, stretching your leg as far as you comfortably can.Then, swing your right leg around to the front of your body. Keep your hands on the ground to keep movement steady, bringing your right hand up briefly to let your right leg through. Keep swinging your right leg until it's on the left side of your body. You will also have to bring your left hand up and down to let your right leg through.Then, hop slightly with your left foot and pass your right leg under your left foot. Return to the original crunch position.
You can repeat this spinning process until you feel comfortable with it. Try to increase your speed as people will be impressed if you're able to do the coffee grinder at a fast pace. You should also switch directions on occasion, spinning with your left leg instead., As freeze moves are important to breakdancing, you should learn a basic freeze when starting out. The baby freeze is a common breakdancing freeze you can incorporate into any routine. This freeze involves elevating your body off the ground slightly.


To start, get on your hands and knees. Press your right elbow against your right hip, bending your arm at a 90 degree angle. Reach your left hand out in front of you.Lean forward and kick your legs up, transferring your weight to your hands and shoulders. Hold for a few seconds.It can take awhile to get the baby freeze right, especially if you lack upper body strength. Do not worry if it takes you a few tries before you balance successfully. You may also have to work on building your upper body strength before you can do a baby freeze.

, A six step is a variation on the three step. Once you've mastered the three step, try incorporating a six step into your routine.


You start off the six step somewhat similar to how you began the coffee grinder. Get into a crouching position. Take your right leg and loop it around your body, stopping when your right leg touches your left foot. Then, lean back with your right side and catch your weight with your right hand.Now, stretch your left leg back diagonally. As you do this, place your hands forward, transferring your weight to your hands. You'll be in a position similar to the position you'd get in to do a push-up. However, your right leg would be turned inward slightly, weight resting on your knees. Stretch your right foot out at a diagonal angle, so you're in a normal push-up position.Bring your left foot to where your right hand is on the ground. Raise your right hand in the air, moving your left hip into the air. Then, bring your right foot behind your knee. You should now be crouching, with your left hand on the ground and your legs crossed.To complete the move, uncross your legs and return to the original starting position."

Seek out an open tile, linoleum, or hardwood surface.,
Put on athletic shoes.,
Choose your hip hop beats.,
Know the basic terminology.,
Know the term ""teched.""",How to Breakdance1," You can also use a large piece of cardboard on any hard surface like concrete. The main idea is that you'll be able to slide easily around the surface of the material.






;
, Breakdancing is truly a sport that requires physical exertion and athletic moves. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes.








, Pick music with an upbeat, steady rhythm and a flow that you can feel. The most important aspect of the music is that you feel inspired and energized by it.








, One of the first things any boy should learn is the difference between ""breakdancing"" and ""Bboying"". Bboying is the first term made to describe the dance; it's usually the term used when in the community. The term ""breakdancing"" was invented by the mainstream media in the 1980s to market the dance. Recently, serious performers have tried to reclaim the name ""Bboying"" for their performance.









The dance is called B-boying whether the performer is male or female. But when describing a certain individual, there's Bboy (male breaker) and B-girl (female breaker).
All breakers have a nickname, such as Bboy Darkness, Bboy Cloud, etc. At first, this shouldn't be too important, but it is in the long run when you want to gain a better hold of who you are as a dancer and gain recognition in your community.

, Teched in the breakdancing world means varied. It is used to describe the six- or four-step movements a performer is doing on the ground. When a B-boy's movements are heavily ""teched,"" they are very complex and distinct.

Use baby freeze as a transition.,
Start off with top rocks.,
Try a simple formula.,
Watch a variety of breakdancing routines.",How to Teach Yourself to Breakdance2," Now that you know some basic moves, you can start formulating a basic breakdancing routine. To start, learn how baby freeze can be used as a transition move. Transition moves are important in that they allow you to move from one breakdancing move to another.


The baby freeze, which you already know, is often used as a transition move. If you're moving between, say, a three-step and into a coffee grinder, you can do the baby freeze in between. This alerts viewers you've ended one move and will be trying a new one.When moving out of something like coffee grinder, you would return to the crouching position. You would then bend your right arm into a 90 degree angle and press it into your hip. Then, you could stretch out your other arm and elevate your legs. You are now in baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds.If you're engaging in top rocks, which we will go over next, you can simply drop to the floor and quickly get into the baby freeze position. Moving into baby freeze after top rocks can be a great transition between footwork and top rocks., Top rocks are hand moves that usually begin a breakdancing routine. Top rocks are simpler than footwork and serve as a signal to viewers you are about to start breakdancing. Learn some simple top rocks to begin your routine.


A basic beginning top rock involves standing with your feet hip-length apart. Move your arms and legs in sync. Step your left toe to your right side, waving your arms at the same pace. Then, return to the original position. Repeat with your right toe. After you feel comfortable with this move, speed it up and bounce slightly with your legs. Try to bounce to the rhythm of any music that's playing when breakdancing in public.You can also try a heel-to-toe step. To start, get in the same opening stance as the beginning. Kick your right foot out onto your heel and then flatten your foot and bend your knees slightly. Move your left foot out, resting your weight on your toe. Then, kick your left foot forward onto your left heel. Bend your knees slightly. Then, step out with your right foot and repeat the process. As with the first move, do this quicker and move to the beat., When you're beginning to breakdance, keep your routines simple. As you become more proficient in breakdancing, you can try longer routines with more complex moves.


To start, try the two different form of top rocks we went over earlier. Try to do them at a fast pace, moving in time with the music. Then, fall to the ground and move into baby freeze. Hold for a few seconds before engaging in footwork.For beginners, a recommended routine is two footwork patterns, baby freeze, and then some light freestyle moves. This means you simply go from one breakdancing move to the next, without transitioning in between.To put it all together, you could start off with the two top rocks moves. Then, fall into baby freeze for a few seconds. Transition into the three step, baby freeze in between, and then do a coffee grinder. Baby freeze again, and then freestyle some more footwork. You could, for example, do a handful of six steps.

, Breakdancing is like any other art form. The more you expose yourself to breakdancing, the more you'll learn. Just as you'll have to read a lot to become a writer, watch a variety of breakdancing routines if you want to learn to breakdance.


You can watch breakdancing routines online. Many break-dancers have active YouTube and Instagram accounts.
Breakdancing is common in the hip-hop community. If there are hip-hop clubs in your hometown, try going a few times a week. You may witness people breakdancing.

Build your strength.,
Consider lessons.,
Learn steps one by one.",How to Teach Yourself to Breakdance3," Breakdancing requires a great deal of physical strength. You should work on strength training exercises if you want to become proficient at breakdancing.


Basic squats, push ups, and crunches are great ways to build strength for breakdancing. You can also engage in weight lifting. Make sure to start slow. At first, you should only engage in strength training 2 to 3 times a week. Never strength train two days in a row.
There is a basic exercise you can do to build strength specifically for breakdancing moves. Start off in a squatting position. Then, lean back on your right side and catch yourself with your right hand. Then, repeat this move on your left hand. Make sure to use the full palms of your hand when catching yourself, and not just your fingertips., Breakdancing, when advanced, can require complex gymnastics. For these types of moves, professional training is vital to make sure you do not hurt yourself. Consider enrolling in a breakdancing course to learn more complex moves. You can also take gymnastics lessons, which will teach you how to maneuver your body in ways that will be useful in breakdancing., Breakdancing involves moving your entire body. If you want to learn to breakdance, try to learn one move at a time. Seek to master a particular move before incorporating it into your routine.It may take a week or more before you feel truly proficient in a breakdancing move. Have patience and practice about an hour each day.
As you get more proficient in a particular move, try to make it more elaborate. Bounce your body slightly as you dance. Move faster. Try dancing to a quicker beat.

Stand on your tip toes and begin to bounce lightly.,
Cross your left leg over and in front of your right leg.,
Hop to uncross your legs back to a a resting position.,
Cross your right leg over and in front of your left leg.,
Jump back to the resting position once again.,
Repeat steps 2 through 4 for as long as you want to top-rock.,
Incorporate hand motions.",How to Breakdance2," This is the portion of the dance that you will complete standing up before you hit the ground and start stepping and spinning.








, You want to be light on your feet and be able to quickly change directions and bounce up and down.








, Stay light on your feet while you perform the crossover move. You don't have to use your left leg first, you just need to make sure that you are alternating feet each time you cross over.








, When in a resting position, your legs will be parallel and your feet ready to change directions.








, Again, be sure to remain on your toes as you do so.








, The key is to go with the rhythm of the music as you top rock, so each time you practice, the speed at which you top rock will depend on the beat of the song. Try to follow the rhythm of the baseline or the snare line.








, These simple movements complete the toprock.








, Once you've gotten the basic footwork down, you can let your hands swing with your body, but don't overdo it. Loosen up your arms and let them follow your feet.









When you step forward, you can allow your arms to swing back behind you, and as you hop back to a resting position, let them swing back to the front of your body.
The arm movements are really up to you, so groove to the music and let your body express itself.
Practice in a mirror to check that you are not flailing your arms too much.

, You are now in the ""crab position.""








, You should be balancing on the outside edge of your left shoe. Lift your right hand up.








,, You should be back where you started, in a pushup position.








, This is the foundational step from which the rest of the breakdancing creativity stems.

Transition to the floor with a coin drop.,
Nail a knee drop.,
Build a backdrop or suicide.",How to Breakdance4," Twist your upper body with your arms tightly wound around yourself. Bend your upper body over until your arms hit the ground. Once your arms hit the ground, you can swing your feet up into the air and transition into other groundwork moves.








, Bend your left leg deeply and place your right leg behind it. Get ready to catch yourself as you fall forward, making the move look like you are actually falling down. Catch yourself with your hands and then allow your bent knee to hit the ground. You are now ready to move on to whatever groundwork you want.








, A backdrop, more commonly (and accurately) called a suicide, is a very advanced move that shouldn't be practiced until a person is comfortable with the basic elements of breakdancing.









Put down a cushion of some sort such as a mattress to practice the suicide move and stand with your feet about two feet apart and your arms out in a T shape straight out from your shoulders.
Kick your right leg out in front of you then swing it back, simultaneously jumping forward with your left leg. Tuck your body in tight and essentially perform a front flip.
Land on the middle part of your back and proceed to move into your groundwork. This move is often performed at the end of a sequence as well.

Throw in a windmill.,
Learn to headspin.,
Show your strength with a jackhammer.",How to Breakdance5," Kneel on the ground with your left elbow tight against your side and your right arm bent at a right angle with your hand in front of your face. Place your hands on the ground and keep your left elbow tucked under your hip bone. You want your weight to be mostly distributed over your left forearm.









Straighten out your legs behind you and hold your body weight with your left forearm. Raise your left leg up and bend your knee.
Kick up your right leg, simultaneously swinging your left leg under your right leg. As you complete this move, push off the ground with your hands and roll over your left shoulder onto your upper back. Make sure your chin is tucked in toward your collar bone during this step to avoid injury.
Return to your home position with your arms on the ground supporting your legs in the air. Now your hands will be on the right side of your body.
Now complete the push off and leg swing on the other side of your body, swinging your left leg under your right and rolling over your right shoulder onto your upper back.
Continue this transfer of momentum from left to right using your entire body, and you've completed a windmill power move!

, In order to perform a headspin move, you must first be able to hold a headstand for several minutes and move your legs around without falling over. Once you're able to perform these tasks, you're ready to try a headspin move. Put on a beanie or a bandana to aid your spinning motion.









Cross your legs and alternate swinging them in a circular motion keeping your upper body in one place to get the feel of the movement. Keep your hands on the ground when just beginning to learn this move.
When you're comfortable with that, begin to let your hands lift off the ground as your legs uncross to allow yourself to spin slowly. Be ready to return your hands to the ground and catch yourself if you need to. The wider you spread your legs, the more momentum you will gain, causing you to spin faster.
Concentrate on keeping your back straight and your neck safe. If you start to feel neck pain, take a break immediately.

, If you have a strong core, you can learn the jackhammer, though it's not an easy move. Balance your body on your two bent arms, with your elbows hugged in at your hips and your feet flared out behind you.









Then try to release one hand and spin on the other, using the free hand to aid you in your spinning. Once you can spin without difficulty, you can move on to the hop.
Place both hands back down on the ground and incorporate small hops into your spin motion. You will now be rotating in a circle as you balance on two hands and hop slightly.
Now take one hand off of the ground and push with it as you spin yourself with the other. Shift all of your weight over to the balancing hand and place your pushing hand behind your back. Bounce on one hand while spinning and you've completed the jack hammer!
The jackhammer is an extremely hard move that takes a lot of strength, so don't be discouraged if this move takes months to get down."

Use your hands to speed up the spin.",How to Headspin," To do a headspin, you will use your legs, arms, and core muscles to balance and spin your body around. You need to warm up these muscles to get the blood flowing into your muscles and to prevent injury. Warm up for 10 to 20 minutes to get your body ready to do a headspin.Jog in place or do lunges to warm up your leg muscles.
Do jumping jacks to warm up your arms and legs.
Perform some yoga poses for balance like tree pose to warm up your core muscles.;
, To perform a headspin, you need a flat floor so that you can balance easier. When you’re a beginner, it helps to practice a headspin on a floor that is smooth like a dance studio’s floor or hardwood floors.Don’t try to do a headspin on carpet, asphalt, or concrete.

, A great way to help you achieve a headspin is to wear something on your head to create resistance. Try wearing a beanie hat, bandana, cap, or even a skateboard helmet when you’re learning to do a headspin.

, Starting on your hands and knees, bow your head and bring the crown of your head down to the floor. Rest the crown of your head on the floor and put the palms of your hands flat on the floor with your fingers pointing away from your face. Move your palms away from your face to create some space between you head and your hands.This creates a tripod shape between your head and two hands.
Your forearms should be perpendicular to the ground.

, Lift your knees off the floor and gently walk your feet up towards your hands. One at a time, lift your leg to place your knee on top of your tricep or elbow. Make sure your head, neck, and back stay in line as you do this.


Balance in this position as you take a few deep breaths. If you feel yourself falling to one direction, gently bring your leg down and get your balance again before putting it back on top of your elbow.

, Before moving your legs up, you need to engage your abdominal muscles to keep your balance. Activate your abdominals and then slowly lift your legs up and off of your elbows, still keeping your knees bent.Balance in this position for a few deep breaths before moving on.

, Keeping your abdominals activated, gently straighten your legs into a full headstand. Do this slowly to ensure you hold your balance the entire time. If you feel yourself falling, bring your legs back down and start over.


Hold the headstand for 3-5 deep breaths and then gently return your feet back to the ground.
When you come down from a headstand, slowly come into a sitting position, having your head be the last to come up. Your head will have a lot of blood in it, so don't bring it up too fast or you might become lightheaded.

, While in a headstand, move your legs so they are split apart in a “V” shape. Engage your core muscles to keep your balance while moving your legs. Once in the “V”position, move your legs back together in a headstand. Do this several times to get comfortable balancing while your legs are moving.

, While in your headstand, bring your legs down into a crossed position and then back up. Try doing this with your right leg crossed over your left and then repeat it crossing your left leg over your right. Make sure your spine stays completely in line with your head when you do this., Staying in your headstand, bring your legs into the “V” position and then rotate them around so that your right leg is pointing forward and your left leg is pointing backwards Then, rotate them back around to bring them back to a headstand position. Repeat this process with your left leg moving to the front.


Your legs should draw a large circle when doing this move.

, Slowly spin your legs while in a headstand first clockwise and then counter clockwise without stopping the motion at all. Keep your abdominal muscles engaged to help you balance as you continuously move your legs around.

, After spinning just your legs around, continue the motion to spin your legs clockwise, but this time, whip them around and lift your hands off the floor so that your upper body spins around in the direction your legs are moving., When you’ve spun around an entire rotation, put your hands back down on the floor to catch yourself and stop the motion. Use your abdominal muscles to keep your balance.


Your legs will still move, so try to get them back in the slow spinning motion you started with as you gain your balance.

, When you get comfortable doing one rotation, you can use your hands to gently tap and push the floor to speed up your spin. Spinning faster will allow you to complete multiple rotations before stopping."

Practice the six steps while standing up.,
Remember to take it slow.,
Practice the steps to music.,
Change the tempo and style of music used.",How to Do the 6 Step (Breakdancing)1," For beginners, learning the steps from a standing position is an easy way to grasp the dance before attempting it on the ground. Before starting, draw out a small, imaginary circle in front of you that you will dance around until you end up back at your starting position.


Step forward with your right foot while keeping your left foot stationary.
Step your left foot behind and to the right of your right foot so they are crossed.
Step out with your right foot so both of your feet are shoulder-width apart.
Cross your left foot over your right foot.
Step your right foot back while keeping your left stationary.
Step your left foot back so your feet are shoulder-width apart and you're back in your starting position. ;
, This motion will seem awkward at first and it will take some to practice to feel comfortable. Take this initial six steps at your own pace as its crucial to have it mastered in a standing position before you will feel capable of learning the 6-step on the floor.

, Run through the footwork for the routine to a song with a slower tempo at first. Oftentimes, you can listen to jazz, funk, hip-hop, or sampled break beats from a number of different or combined sources (soul, electronic, disco). When in doubt, practice to some of the original artists breakdancers used in their routines such as Al Green, The Meters, Funkadelic, Skull Snaps, Instant Funk, and Taana Gardner., As you become more comfortable with the 6-Step, you will begin to develop your muscle memory. This in turn will allow you to take your conscious attention away from the basic steps and work on ways in which to polish the move as a whole. By varying the music that you use, you will become adaptive and adept at dancing within a wide range of styles and moods. The hallmark of a dynamic dancer is looseness and confidence.

Start on your palms or your fingertips so your hands are gently arched in order to have maximum control.

, You will never be flat-footed during this routine as it will similarly cause you to slide and compromise the balance of the routine. However, your feet will occasionally be on the heels. Stay propped on your toes for the majority of the dance as it is crucial to allow for quick movements and a full range of motion.

, Make sure your back is straight before staring. Bring the right leg forward and extend it in front of the left while keeping the left leg in place. Lean on the outside of your right foot and take your left hand off the floor., Make sure it is bent and touching the back of your right leg. Your right leg should be wrapped loosely around your left leg, and you should be in a tilted cross-legged position. Keep your left hand in the air., Bring your right leg out from around your left leg. Plant your right foot down next to your left foot about a shoulder-width apart. Put your left hand on the floor behind you., Place it in front of your bent right leg so it is wrapped around your right leg. Make sure to lean on the outside of your left foot while lifting your right hand up. , Keep leaning on the outside of your left foot with your right hand in the air. In this motion you are preparing to return to the starting position., Extend your left leg back and put your right hand down. This brings you back around to the starting position and resets the routine. , Another way to simplify the steps is considering which hand is on the ground. For the first half of the routine your right hand will be on the ground while the left is in the air. And on the last half your left hand will be on the ground while your right is in the air.

, As mentioned in the standing position, it is absolutely crucial that you take these steps slow and practice them often in order to increase your pace. Taking your time is vitally important here as there is more room for error and physical injury when you're performing the 6-step on the ground. Work your body strength up to the level where this dance is more comfortable so you're not damaging any muscles in the process.

Master the 5-step variation.,
Bring your A-game for the 7-step.,
Try the 6-Step in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.",How to Do the 6 Step (Breakdancing)3," This routine is a slightly tweaked version of the 6-step. It requires a bit more skill and athleticism as the fifth step is changed so you switch the placement of your body weight quickly. The 5-step is not for beginners so make sure you have a master of the 6-step before attempting this variation.


The first few moves of the 5-step are identical to the 6-step. So you're starting in the push-up position, and extending the right leg in front of the left while keeping the left leg in place. Lean on the outside of your right foot and take your left hand off the floor.
Pull the left leg forward. This motion is the same as in the 6-step. Bend your left leg to where it is touching the back of your right leg. Your right leg should be wrapped loosely around your left leg, and you should be in a tilted cross-legged position while keeping your left hand in the air.
Bring your right leg out from around your left leg. You should be in the crab position where your legs are shoulder-width apart and your left hand is on the floor behind you.
Cross your left leg around your right leg. As in the 6-step, make sure to lean on the outside of your left foot while lifting your right hand up.
Here's where it differs. Instead of bringing your right leg behind you as you would in the 6-step, shift hands so you're leaning on your right hand again. Once your body weight is shifted on the right hand, kick your right leg out with your left hand in the air.
Bring your right leg in so you're at a crab position which will serve as your new starting point to repeat the 5-step., This version changes certain moves in the beginning while adding an extra step as well that requires more nuanced footwork. When practicing the 7-step, make sure to highlight the differences between the 6-step to make this variation stand out.


As with the 6-step, start in a push-up position on your toes, fingertips, or your palms. Avoid flat feet and hands.
Don't bring around your left leg to touch the back of the bent right leg. Instead, bring your left leg over your right so your hip is jutting outward while the right remains in place. You can put your hand on the hip if it helps to maintain balance.
Bring your right leg under and in front of your body so it is stretched out while your calf is parallel to the floor. Your left leg while stay in place.
Bend your right knee so you are in the crab position. Here both feet should be firm planted should-width apart while your left hand rests behind you.
Hook your left leg around your right so your right leg is bent and touching the back of your left.
Step your right foot behind you while keeping the left stationary.
Bring your left foot under your body so your feet are shoulder-width apart in the same push-up position you started with. , Practice the routine in both directions for added flexibility. You can also reverse alternate directions during the same routine, which will be helpful when adding freezes, where your body stays motionless, and other variations. "

Put on a pair of socks.,
Find a smooth surface.,
Place one foot directly in front of the other and stand on the toes of your back leg.,
Keep your balance.,
Slide your left heel back and ""into"" the floor.,
Snap the heel of your left foot up off the floor as you simultaneously snap the heel of your right foot down.,
Repeat the previous two steps, switching the roles of your left and right foot.,
Add some frills.",How to Moonwalk," Though you can moonwalk in anything, even hiking boots, you should have as little traction as possible as a beginner. Wearing socks will make it much easier for you to practice your moves and to glide across the floor.









When you become a pro, you can even master this move with sneakers! That may seem impossible at first.;
, Once again, smoothness is key, and while you can try it anywhere, it helps to be on a smooth, flat, non-stick surface, such as a hardwood floor or a smooth-tiled floor. Most dance floors will work, of course, but so will most kitchen floors. Stay away from rough or uneven surfaces or carpeted areas.









If you don't have any smooth surfaces in your home, then you're better off using shoes on a rough surface than socks.
When you're an expert, you'll even be able to practice on a carpet.

, Then, lift your right leg and place the toes of your right foot facing the floor, approximately a foot behind your left leg. Keep your arms at your sides -- you can worry about them later. Keep your left foot flat on the ground.








, You can do this by increasing the width between your legs and feet until you feel stable. A good rule of thumb is to have them about 3-6 inches (the width of one of your feet) apart. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can do the moonwalk with your legs closer together. You can lift your arms a bit if that helps you keep your balance as you move backward.








, Do this as you lean back on your right leg so that your left foot finishes behind the right leg. During this, the heel of your right foot should still remain in the air, with the toes pointed down on the floor. Put all of the weight into your lifted leg, so the leg that is flat on the floor feels weightless.








, Now you are in the same position you started with, only your feet have changed positions. Your right foot should now be in front of your left leg instead of the other way around. To do the moonwalk correctly, only one of your feet should be in the air at any given time. Always one; never two, and never zero.








, The moonwalk can really be mastered by perfecting these movements over and over, until it looks like you're really walking on the moon and when your feet are really moving back and back smoothly, without any kinks.








, Add a head movement to help create the illusion of ""moonwalking."" As you slide your leg back, move your head forward as if it's being left behind in the movement. Then pull it back to the body as you switch to the other foot.









You can also swing your arms with every step, or hunch over your shoulders and grab your hat (if you're wearing one) like Michael Jackson did.
You can use your whole body to show that you're walking on the moon, not just your feet.

Try a light aerobic workout to get your blood pumping.,
Do stretches.,
Do crunches or sit-ups.,
Stretch your wrists and arms.,
Stretch your neck.",How to Do the Baby Freeze1," Warming up is important because it stretches out your muscles and literally warms them up. It can help prevent injury.;
, For instance, you can do jumping jacks or walking push-ups.For jumping jacks, start with your arms and legs straight together. At the same time, jump your legs out to about shoulder length and bring your arms up by your head. Jump back to the original position and repeat.For walking push-ups, do a couple of push-ups like normal, and then stay in the same position to move over four steps. Do more push-ups., Stretching will help you be more flexible when you do actually start dancing.For instance, try hamstring stretches. Sit on the floor with one leg bent away. Stretch the other leg out in front of you. Let the outstretched leg pull inward while leaning forward. Hold for half a minute. Repeat a few times, and then switch to the other leg., These moves build strong core muscles, which makes it easier to perform all types of dance moves., In breakdancing, weight is often carried on the arms and wrists, so you need to ensure they are flexible enough before starting.


Holding your arm out, move your hand back and forth to slowly stretch out the muscles.With you arm still outstretched, flipped your hand over and back several times.To stretch out your forearms, place your palms together in front of you with your elbows out. Rotate your hands forward, stretching the muscles, and then rotate them back., You will be using your head and neck for balance.


Standing straight, gently roll your neck in a circle, loosening your neck muscles. Repeat, moving in the opposite direction.
Looking straight ahead and gently grab the side of your head, pulling your ear toward your shoulder and holding for a few counts. Do the same on the opposite side.

Then lean forward to your original position. Practice until you get a rhythm, then stop.As you master this, you’ll bounce a little as you move. Your movements will get shorter and faster.;
, Stand straight with your feet next to one another. Move your right foot forward like you’re going to take a step, except take that step diagonally to the left. Your right foot should be far out ahead of your left foot, not touching it. Let your left heel lift up to support you.

, Bring your right foot back so that you’re standing in a neutral position. Your feet should now be next to each other again.

, Repeat the cross step you did before, only with your left foot. Bring it forward and across your right foot. Let your right heel rise to support you before you step back. Practice this, then try adding a hop when you bring your feet back to the neutral position.

, Now it’s time to incorporate your arms. When you step out, bring your arms up from your side. Let your palms face forward, away from you. Practice raising your arms as you step forward and bringing them back as you step back., Now repeat the step movements, raising your arms. When you step back, bring your arms into your chest. Cross them to form an X.

, Get into the habit of this dance move. You may want to select a music track and try to dance to the beat. When you step back, bend your knees a little. Also add a small hop when you step back if you haven’t already.


Practice this regularly. As you get more comfortable, your movements will get more fluid and you’ll get a better sense of the rhythm.
Once you can do this, you can customize it with your own moves or transition to different toprocks.

, Footwork techniques such as the six step add variety to toprocks. The six step looks intimidating but isn’t as hard as it seems. Start off by lowering yourself to the ground. If this is painful, practice squatting as low as you can to build more strength in your calves.


Once you can squat a little, you can also practice shifting your weight. Lean backwards to the right and catch yourself by planting your right hand on the ground. Raise up and repeat with your left side.

, Sweep your right foot outwards. Bring it all the way around and under your left knee. Wrap it as far back as you can and use your right hand to brace yourself against the ground., You’ll have to rise a little to do this. Bring both hands forward and plant them on the ground as you move your left foot backwards and away from you. Your left foot should go diagonally to the left rather than straight back.

, Bring your right foot back and away from you. It should also move diagonally, except to the right. You will be in a flat position like you’re about to do a pushup. Keep your back lowered, though, and your head and torso raised. Try to get your feet past the width of your shoulders., Bend your knees a little before you do this to avoid putting pressure on them. While keeping your foot close to the ground, bring your left foot directly to your right hand. To get it across your body, you’ll have to raise up a little. Keep your left hand planted. Bring your right hand to your right hip., While supporting yourself against the ground with your right hand, move your right foot forward. Keep it pointed straight out, away from your body. Now your left leg will be wrapped under your right knee.

, Bring your right leg back to a neutral starting position. Plant it on the ground and you’ll find yourself in the squat position again, completing the six step. Practice it to get faster. Also try the six step while starting on the opposite leg.

, The corkscrew up is a stylish way to get off the floor. Like any breakdance move, it can be linked with other moves. Start practicing by squatting.

, Wrap one foot around the other the same way you would in a six step. For example, your right foot goes under your left knee. Plant your right hand on the ground behind you to support yourself.Breakdance moves can be performed in either direction. You can do this move by starting with your left foot, too.

, Right before you begin to rise, twist yourself a little towards the hand that’s on the ground. Use slight motion. All you need is to generate a little momentum when you rise.

, Give a gentle push with your limbs to help give you force to rise. You’re going to need the momentum to uncoil and turn back to a neutral standing position.

, As you rise, turn away from the hand that’s on the ground. Spin around until you are near the direction you want to face. To stop, you can raise the foot that was curled earlier and stomp it down with flair.


This move can also be done in reverse to get closer to the ground.

, Freezes are pauses at the ends of moves and a handstand is one of the simplest freezes. Plant your hands on the ground ahead of you, shoulder-width apart. Keep your back bent.

, Start by kicking one leg up to get a sense of how much force you’ll need. Once you’re ready, try to kick up your leg with force, allowing your other leg to follow. For extra momentum, stand straight and kick immediately after planting your hands.To overcome fear and learn balance, you can balance against a wall first.

, Most breakdancers learn to bend their legs backwards while doing a handstand. This gives them extra stability so that they can freeze in place for a few seconds. At first, concentrate on getting upright and monitoring your balance. As you go, adjust your legs.

, Landing also requires learning balance. Shift your weight into one of your arms. Lean the opposite leg towards the direction you want to land. Once you start leaning, gravity will pull you down, but you’ll have control. Plant your feet on the ground and stand."

Once you’ve practiced this move a few times, switch to the other side, starting with your left foot. Repeat the same movements on the left side.

, Pick music that is upbeat and has a 1-2 count. Often, popular hip hop and electronic music tracks are good for b-boy dancing. Do a series of moves one after the other to the music in counts. This will help you move seamlessly from one move to the other in the combination.For example, you may do the top rock for eight counts, followed by the indian step for eight counts, and then the kick and twist for eight counts.
Once you get this combination down, you can try moving a bit faster and doing each movement a bit quicker. For example, you may do the top rock for two counts, followed by the indian step for four counts, and then two counts of the kick and twist.

, Start on your hands and feet, with your legs bent and a little wider than hip width apart. Bend over backward and place your hands on the ground so you are in a table shape, with your stomach and chest facing upward. Lift your right hand, supporting your weight on your legs and your left hand. Next, throw your right hand to the left in a swiping motion.

, Select music that has a loud beat and follows a 1-2 count. Hip hop and electronica are popular genres for b-boy dancing. Do a series of movements in a row to the music. Use counts to determine how many movements you are doing in the combination. You can integrate basic moves between harder moves for variety.For example, you may start with a top rock for four counts, followed by a swipe for four counts, and a baby freeze that you hold for four counts.
You can speed up the combinations as you get more confident. For example, you may do a kick and twist for two counts, followed by a swipe for four counts, and a baby freeze for two counts.

Remember to exercise the wrists each time you try the freeze position with one hand.,
Try the freeze for 10 seconds or more.,
Show and introduce the move to your family and friends.,
Keep progressing and continue to work those wrists.",How to Do a Freeze on One Hand," Most beginners will not be familiar with the term and will think you have to halt and stay still for a certain amount of time. This is not true when it comes to break dancing. Do not suddenly rush into it and think that you will be able to do it first time because the chances are you won't. Your body will not be used to staying in the freeze position for a certain period of time because the muscles that are used have not grown strong enough to be able to maintain the weight. Able learners may learn the move properly after one day and then progress on to make it better and to learn others. The freeze requires a bit of effort but only a short amount of time and once it is learned and mastered then it is time to move on and try something a bit more challenging.;
, The part of your body that is required most for a typical freeze is the wrists. They need to be strong enough to take the whole of your body weight. It is usually easier for people who are thin and healthy to learn the freeze because less weight will be required. However anyone can learn the freeze. The other parts required for balancing and maintaining the freeze position are the head, upper body, abs, elbows, knees, legs and feet.

, Stretch your body so that your muscles tighten and you can feel it in the required body parts. Hold each stretch for 10 seconds to ensure that the body parts warm up and then they will eventually become used to the exercise, making the freeze a lot more easier to learn.

, For beginners, the freeze requires a lot of stabbing in certain parts of the body and at first they might feel painful but start off wearing a jumper so that it feels less painful, and then gradually use lighter clothing as your body becomes used to it.

, Look around you to see if you're going to hit anything and if you are, move it away so it is safer. You might fall at first so it is better to fall directly on to the floor rather than on another object.

, Try doing a few practice exercises before starting the freeze. Good examples for this are putting weight on the wrists, bending the wrists back and forth and shaking them out, tensing the upper body and ab muscles and doing sit ups and press ups can sometimes help as well.

, This can be the starting position for most beginners. Let your head become used to the floor you are practicing on, if it is carpet or grass it will take a short time to get used to, but if it is something like marble, glass, concrete, wood or lino, then that will take a bit more time to get used to.

, Hold the elbows and tense the muscles for 10 seconds so that they also become used to the exercise. You should look like you're eavesdropping on the floor because your head is touching it.

, Stabbing basically means bringing the elbow of your right or left arm to a certain area in the upper or lower body. The best place to stab on the body for an easy freeze is the back, hips, or side. It is best to stab there for a while before you start stabbing with the abs. The abs take a bit more time to get used to the position.

, Hold it there but don't try to balance just yet. Now stab the left elbow into the bottom of your left thigh and hold it there without balancing. Now if you keep your head and hands flat on the floor, you should be able to feel a certain amount of weight from the stabs. Keep in this position for a couple of seconds so you become used to the stabbing.

, This is a facepalm position but it is better to get used to this position before maintaining the freeze position. The left knee should now be balancing on top of the left elbow and the right side of your body should be balancing on the right elbow. If you take the left knee off the elbow, you will either fall or if you're really strong, you will still keep in the position but will require more effort and much more weight.

, Every now and again keep doing the facepalm position so your entire body becomes used to it. The head will seem to want to stay where it is. This for now is a good starting position and it is classed as a freeze, but only just. Remember to exercise the wrists each time you practice.

, After a while your body will now be used to making contact with the ground for a bit of time. Now you can put on more weight on the wrists and slowly bring your head up while still keeping to the position. Now you are not doing a facepalm as the head is no longer on the ground. This is the normal freeze position. Now practice this and try to keep to the position for about 5 seconds or more, exercising the wrists as you go along.

, You will need days of practice to become properly used to the freeze position. Try it on different surfaces, and let the body become used to each surface slowly before you move on. Don't go and impress your friends and family just yet! The last thing you want is to fall over while in the position and injure yourself. Practice makes perfect and it takes time so don't rush.

, You will need the exercise if you want to try the freeze position with just one hand. This part of the procedure will take days, weeks, maybe even months to get right, so for now just focus on getting those parts exercised and used to the position.

, Practice loads to be able to maintain the position for the amount of time. Try it on different surfaces and as soon as you're ready, move on.

, If you fall over at first keep practicing and practicing until you don't.

, You do not want to strain your wrists so that they can no longer support body weight. Practice the freeze position with one hand loads. Frequently per day is most recommended for you to get the best out of it as you possibly can. Remember to try it on different surfaces.

, After many weeks, maybe even months or years of practice, your body should now definitely be used to the freeze position with one hand. It takes a long time to figure out the right position and where the wrists actually make contact with the ground. Good stability is key for this move.

, It is now time to show people what you can do. Being a break dancer is not about being isolated and alone, you have to share what you can do and learn from other people as well as yourself. If you are the sort of the person who is shy, then practice expressing yourself before showing anyone. Express yourself as you show the move to your fellow people and avoid showing off and attention seeking. Think of it as if no one is watching you and then go for it. Chances are you will get surprises or shouts or praise from your family or friends.

, Do not go and boast about the move to anyone, you will lose respect and they may become jealous of you. Remember if anyone takes the mick out of you, ignore it and continue doing the move and as you progress on start to learn the other break dance moves as well!

Practice the move.",How to Do the Baby Freeze3," To position yourself for the Baby Freeze, you need to squat all the way down, low to the floor. Your legs should be a little less than shoulder-width apart with the weight on the balls of your feet.If this position is not comfortable, you can also start with one knee on the floor and the other leg bent with your foot on the ground. Make sure the foot on the ground is the same side as your strongest arm., To properly distribute your weight for the Baby Freeze, you need to position your arms correctly.Place your less strong arm on the other side of the opposite knee. Your leg will eventually rest on the back of that arm above the elbow.Use your dominant arm to take the brunt of the weight. The elbow will go into the side of your body, near the hip and below the rib cage., Keeping your arms in position (you may need to stretch out the dominant arm a bit), place your palms face down Place both of your hands on the ground on the outside of your dominant leg., Slowly tilt your body to the side, moving your legs away from your arms to balance yourself.Put your strongest arm back into position, resting it at a 90-degree angle firmly against your abs near your hip, fingers splayed slightly on the ground and pointing away from you.Your other arm should be about shoulder-width away from the first. It should also be at a 90-degree angle up against your knee, balancing your stance., Slowly lean your head towards the floor in front of your arms, resting your head on the mat.Once the side of your head is on the ground, shift most of your weight to your strongest arm, using the side of your head and other arm for balance. Both of your arms should still be bent.

, Once you feel comfortable, lift your legs off the ground, resting them on your non-dominant arm. Your leg should rest on the bicep.This step may take you a few tries.

Don't rest on your cheek., Once you've gotten your legs in the right position, you need to hold yourself in that position, the ""freeze"" part of the move., This move may take a while to get perfectly.

Easing the tension from your body can help steady your voice and relax your mind. Rehearse your lines. If you mess up on stage, don't panic! Make it seem like the act.Here are a few things you can do to relax your body before your performance.Gently hum to steady your voice.
Eat a banana before you perform. It will lower that empty or nauseous feeling in your stomach but won't make you feel too full either.
Chew gum. Chewing gum a little bit to ease the tension in your jaw. Just don't chew gum too long or on an empty stomach or you may upset your digestive system a bit.
Stretch. Stretching your arms, legs, back, and shoulders is another great way to reduce the tension in your body.;
, On the morning before your performance, or even an hour before, take 15-20 minutes out of your day to meditate. Find a relatively quiet place where you can take a comfortable seat on the ground. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing as you relax every part of your body.


Rest your hands on your lap and fold your legs.
Try to reach a point where you no longer think about anything besides relaxing your body one part a time -- especially not your performance.

, Unless you're normally a caffeine addict, don't have extra caffeine on the day of the performance. You may think that it will make you perform with more energy, but it will actually make you feel more nervous and jittery.....

, On the day of your performance, tell yourself that you can allow yourself to be nervous for a certain amount of time, but that after a certain hour -- say, 3 PM -- all anxiety will go out the door. Just setting this goal and making this promise to yourself will make it much more likely to happen.

, Exercise releases tension and gets your endorphins going. Make time for at least thirty minutes of exercise on the day of your performance, or at least take a thirty-minute walk. This will get your body geared for an amazing performance.

, Watch a comedy in the morning, put on your favorite YouTube video, or just spend the afternoon hanging around the funniest person in your company. Laughing will relax you and take your mind off your nervousness.

, Show up to your presentation earlier than anyone in the audience. You'll feel much more in control if the room is filling up after you arrive instead of showing up to a full house. Showing up early will also ease your nerves and will make you feel less rushed and more at peace.

, Some people like to sit in the audience and start chatting with people to get more comfortable. This will make you see that the audience members are just ordinary people like you, and will help you manage your expectations. You can also just sit in the audience as it fills up for a bit without telling anyone who you are -- this will only work if you're not in costume, of course.

, Instead of imagining every person in the audience in their underwear -- which can be a little weird -- imagine that every seat in the audience is filled with a clone of your favorite person. That person loves you and will listen to and approve of anything you say or do. That person will laugh at the right times, encourage you, and clap wildly at the end of the performance.

, Drinking citrus juice half an hour before your performance can lower your blood pressure and ease your anxiety., Falling into a comfortable rhythm will make you feel more at peace and in control. If you feel comfortable reciting the words to your favorite song or poem, you'll feel more comfortable about delivering your lines with ease and grace.

Make your scene clear.,
Exaggerate your facial expression.,
Keep each and every motion precise.,
Keep your scenes simple yet entertaining.,
Set your goals and aim high.,
Jot down some story plots.,
Characters.,
Here are the basic script Plot outlines.",How to Pantomime," Understanding your scene will help you understand what kind of body language to interpret into your performance. For example: If your scene involves your character angrily struggling to carry a package, you would want to use specific facial expression and movement to portray anger and struggle.

, Facial expression is one of the most important factors in pantomime. If your character is happy, a simple smirk will not do. Expressions should be amplified to replace your speech. If you could still speak during pantomime you could easily express your character's feelings using your voice as well as your face and body language.

, Make gestures bigger than life. In pantomime objects are almost always involved. But, your objects are not real, they are pantomimes (meaning your item is invisible and you will have to use your body to shape it as if it was there). You will not have real props available, so understand the five qualities of objects and how to Incorporate them into your performance:


Weight- To show the weight of an object, use your muscles and movement to show straining or flexing.
Size- Be reasonable with the size of the object you are pantomiming.
Shape- The shape of objects is also a very important factor. You may not be able to show the exact shape of every object though.
Consistency- Make sure nothing changes throughout the performance. Keep objects the same size and shape, put things back in the same place that you got them, etc.
Resistance- Make movements sharp and crisp.

, Have a funny story, or give your character a background tale. Scenes should be easy for the audience to interpret what's going on. They should not last more than 3 minutes. The process of watching a well-executed pantomime is itself satisfying; A complicated plot simply muddies the action.

, Don't aim low because you may hit lower than your goal.;
, Good pantomimes should soar above reality. That is why pantomime is extremely exaggerated and dramatized. Sad or tragic pantomimes aren't always the best unless the are seriously dramatized. (ex. A woman comes home to find her husband dead and is so devastated that she panics and commits suicide with a severely dramatic touch). Fairy tales and mythical plots also appeal to all audiences. Choose your story wisely.

, Consider the following:


Dames- Dames are popular characters and are sure to give the audience a good laugh.
Villain - Villains are a large part in any performance, there is always a good antagonist in a good pantomime.
Hero- Strong character; shouldn't be a challenge filling him into the story.
Heroine- Fun, and imaginative female character that the audience will fall in love with.

,


Introduce main characters
Establish comical character
Crisis
Troubles; crisis resolved
Happy ending with comedy

Make it interesting.,
Consider your audience.,
Don't tell people you're nervous.,
Record yourself.,
Move around, but don't fidget.,
Slow down.,
Ask how you did.",How to Overcome Stage Fright2," This may sound obvious, but it's likely that part of the reason you're having stage fright is because you're worried that everyone will think you're boring. Well, you may be worried about being boring because your material is boring. Even if you're speaking or presenting very dry material, think of ways to make it more accessible and engaging. You'll be less worried about presenting if you know that your content will be engaging.If it's appropriate, make some room for laughter. Throw in a few jokes that will ease your tension and relax the audience.

, As you create and practice your presentation, consider the needs, knowledge, and expectations of audience. If you're speaking to a younger audience, adjust your content, voice, and speech as necessary. If it's an older and more stern audience, be more practical and logical. You'll be less nervous if you know that you'll actually be able to reach the people who are listening to you.

, Don't show up on stage and make a little joke about being nervous. Everyone will assume that you're confident just because you're already up there. Announcing that you're nervous may make you feel better, but the audience will lose faith in you instead of paying attention.

, Videotape yourself as you give your presentation. Keep presenting and taping until you can look at the recording and think, ""Wow, that's a great presentation!"" If you're not happy with how you look on tape, then you won't be pleased with how you appear in person. Keep doing this until you get it right. When you're up on stage, just remember how great you looked in the video, and tell yourself that you can do even better.

, You can blow off some nervous energy and reach your audience by pacing back and forth across the stage. If you move around with energy and gesture for emphasis, you'll be overcoming your stage fright just by moving. But don't fidget by moving your hands together, playing with your hair, or fiddling with your microphone or speech or presentation notes.


Fidgeting will only build tension and will make your audience see that you're uncomfortable.

, Most public speakers manifest their stage fright by talking way too fast. You may be speaking fast because you're nervous and want to get the speech or presentation over with, but this will actually make it harder for you to articulate your ideas or to reach your audience. Most people who talk too fast don't even realize that they're doing it, so remember to pause for a second after every new thought, and to leave room for your audience to react to important statements.


Slowing down will also make you less likely to stumble over your words or misspeak.
Time your presentation beforehand. Get used to the pace that you need to finish your presentation at the appropriate time. Keep a watch handy and glance at it from time to time to make sure you're on track.

, If you really want to improve your stage fright, you should ask your audience how you did by asking for feedback afterwards, handing out surveys, or asking colleagues in the audience to give their honest opinion. Knowing what you did well will build your confidence, and knowing how you can improve will help you feel more confident the next time you get on stage."
"
Fake confidence.,
Create a ritual.,
Think positively.,
Get advice from a pro performer.",How to Overcome Stage Fright3," Even if your hands feel like silly putty and your heart is racing, just act like the coolest person in the world. Walk with your head high and a big smile on your face, and don't tell anyone how nervous you are. Maintain this posture when you get on the stage and you'll actually start to feel confident.


Look straight ahead instead of down at the floor.
Don't slouch.

, Come up with a fail-proof ritual for the day of your performance. This could be a three-mile jog on the morning of your performance, the same ""last meal"" before your performance, or even singing a certain song in the shower or putting on your lucky socks. Do whatever it is you have to do to gear yourself toward success.


A lucky charm is a great part of a ritual. It could be a piece of jewelry that's important to you, or a silly stuffed animal that cheers you on from your dressing room.

, Focus on all of the amazing results of your presentation or performance instead of everything that can go wrong. Combat every negative thought with five positive ones. Keep an index card with motivational phrases in your pocket, or do whatever you need to do to focus on all of the benefits that the performance will give you instead of honing in on all of the fear and anxiety that you may be feeling.

, If you have a friend who is a knockout performer, whether it's from stage acting or giving presentations, ask for their advice. You may learn some new tricks and will be comforted by the fact that almost everyone gets stage fright, no matter how confident he or she may appear on stage.

"
Visualize success.,
Practice as much as possible.,
Get into character.,
Watch your own performance.,
Learn to improvise.,
Move your body.,
Turn off your mind.",How to Overcome Stage Fright4," Before you get on stage, just picture yourself knocking it out of the park. Imagine a standing ovation, picture the smiles on the audience members' faces, and hear the sound of your cast mates or director telling you what an amazing job you did. The more you focus on visualizing the best possible outcome instead of worrying over the worst case scenario, the more likely it is to happen. Picture yourself being amazing on stage from the audience's point of view.


Start early. Start visualizing success from the second you're cast in the role. Get into the habit of imagining what a great job you'll do.
As you get closer to the starting date, you can work harder on visualizing success by picturing what a great job you'll do every night before you go to bed and every morning when you wake up.

, Do this until you memorize it. Remember the words of the person who speaks before you, so you recognize the cue for you to speak. Practice in front of family, friends, and stuffed animals and even in front of empty chairs, so that you are used to performing in front of people.Part of the fear of performing comes from thinking that you'll forget your lines and won't know what to do. The best way to prepare against forgetting your lines is to be as familiar with them as possible.
Practicing in front of others helps you get used to the fact that you won't be reciting your lines alone. Sure, you may know them perfectly when you're alone in your room, but it'll be a whole new ball game when you're facing an audience.

, If you really want to overcome stage fright, work on truly inhabiting the actions, thoughts, and worries of your character. The more in tune you are with the character you're portraying, the more likely you'll be to forget your own worries. Imagine that you really are that person instead of a nervous actor trying to portray that person.

, Gain confidence in yourself by reciting your lines in front of a mirror. You can even tape your own performance to see how amazing you are, and to look out for areas of improvement. If you keep taping or watching yourself until you know you're really killing it, then you'll be much more likely to succeed on the stage.


Being able to see yourself perform will also help you conquer your fear of the unknown. If you know exactly what you look like, you'll feel more comfortable on the stage.
Watch your mannerisms, and look at how you move your hands as you speak.


Note: this may not work for everyone. This trick may make some people feel more self-conscious and aware of every movement of their bodies. If watching yourself starts making you more nervous, then avoid this tactic.



, Improvisation is a skill that all good actors should master. Improvising will help you prepare for a less-than-perfect situation on the stage. Many actors and performers are so worried about forgetting or messing up their lines that they often don't consider that other cast members are just as likely to make a mistake; knowing how to improvise will help you feel comfortable with performing on the fly and being prepared for anything that comes your way.


Improvising will also help you see that you can't control every aspect of the performance. It's not about being perfect -- it's about being able to react to any situation.
Don't act startled or lost if something unexpected happens. Remember that the audience doesn't have a copy of the script and that they'll only be able to tell if something went wrong if you make it obvious.

, Staying physically active before and during the performance will help ease your tension and keep the audience's interest. Of course, you should only move when the character is supposed to move, but make the most of your movements and gestures so that your body becomes more relaxed by being active.

, Once you're on stage, just focus on your words, your body, and your facial expressions. Don't waste time over thinking it and asking yourself pesky questions. Just start enjoying your performance and inhabiting the moment, whether you're singing, dancing, or reciting lines. If you've learned to turn off your mind and fully inhabit your performance, the audience will know.

When you walk down the street, try to make eye contact with strangers.",How to Have Presence," It is virtually impossible to have presence, have that ""it"" factor, when you're riddled with insecurities. Instead of engaging in the moment and grabbing it by its horns, you'll be busy huddling in the corner waiting for the jury to get their harsh judgment over with. No article can show you a mathematical formula for confidence, but it can tell you how awesome you are. And that you definitely have things to be confident about.


It's important -- at least in the topic of having presence -- to think of confidence as quiet. No hard-hitting bravado or hubris is appropriate here. There's no room for displays of power or boastfulness. Presence is natural and just is. Your confidence needn't be a show; it should just be something that's a part of you. Think of confidence as in the same category as your height or hair color. People notice. You don't say anything about it, but people notice. That's how it should be.;
, Let's say Beyoncé joins you in line for the women's restroom (or Jay-Z if you're a male, but then there's probably not a line). You would love to have a conversation with her and to snap a quick photo, but you really have to pee. How present and engaged will you be with her? Not very. So whatever situation you're in (Beyoncé or not), get comfortable. It'll be the only way you can give it your all.


That means adjust the temperature, go to the bathroom, and, for your sake, wear comfortable pants. If you feel something in your teeth or are constantly fighting an uphill battle against a wedgie, you won't be exuding presence. Do whatever you can to un-preoccupy your mind.

, There is a certain genuineness about presence. After all, if you're fake, it's not you who's in the room. It's some image you're trying to show the world. Most people can detect this, whether they're aware of it or not. So act natural. Be yourself. What good is it doing you pretending to be something else?


People who aren't comfortable with themselves are always caught up in some image-maintaining. They feel like they have to be seen wearing the right things, saying the right things, doing the right things, and all in the right places with the right people. They have no view of themselves because the only thing that matters to them is the opinions of others. These people don't have presence -- presence isn't something anyone else can give you!

, Really, we've spent the past four paragraphs saying just this. If the people you're with don't like you, how long are you really gonna be around them anyway? You're not. So if you are just you (which is the only person you'll be around for the rest of, oh, you know, forever), and you're not caught up worrying about your image, the better parts of you can shine.


Think of this impression management as a layer of dust over whatever it is that makes up you. Instead of seeing who you are, people see this dust. The dust isn't bad, the dust isn't good, it's just dust. It's easily wiped away. And while it doesn't turn other people off, it hides what makes you memorable. It hides what makes you awesome.

, If presence were easily define-able, part of the definition would be an innate sense of calmness. Someone with presence, charisma, and that ineffable ""it"" factor is never seen storming about, making waves, or punishing others arbitrarily. Generally anger is a resort and someone with presence just doesn't need to waste time on it. They're too calm and collected to need to put up a fuss.

, Seriously. Have you ever gone out to a restaurant and noticed that one couple that's sitting by the window, where the guy is on his phone playing Candy Crush and the girl is taking selfies or pictures of the food that was once on her half-eaten plate? If you want people to notice you, hiding behind a light-up screen isn't the way to go about doing it. So get in the moment. Put your phone away (not just down) and give the people around you your undivided attention.


So here's a little science being dropped: so much of how people think and feel about you is really how you make them feel about themselves. If you pay attention to them, they're going to feel important, and they're going to like you and think you're a great listener. Flirt with someone and they like you because you make them feel attractive. So when you put your phone down, you're showing them you're there. With them and only them. That you care and that they matter. Boom. You're present. And what's a word that sounds ridiculously like present? Hmm.

, Okay, let's say you're walking into a big, important meeting. You want to be the one who people can look to, the natural leader for the next assigned project, the one people come to with questions -- and not the other way around. But you're a little nervous and you know you're a little nervous. Instead of walking in and throwing up the white flag, take a deep breath. Maybe smooth your hair a bit, adjust your seams, slow your movements, and then walk in. You got this. Why would anyone think otherwise?


No, you're right, presence is not a show. It's not something you lose when you're harried and rushed. But if you're nervous, if you're running around like a chicken with your head cut off, people can see that. You might still be super confident and have your act together, but you'll appear too frazzled for that intangible aura of leadership to come through.

, Let's take Steve Jobs. A really powerful guy. Eloquent, charming, rich as hell. Now imagine him at a meeting where he's slumped over, ignoring everyone, and just playing on his iPhone, face adorned with a slight scowl. Not exactly a guy you'd peg for having presence, huh? So even if you are the one in the room with the most presence, you gotta show it. So spread out. The room is yours.


Feel free to spread out a bit. People who are more confident are more comfortable taking up a bit more room. Put your arms on the table. Lean forward a bit, into the person who's talking to show you're engaged. Nod when it's clear they're trying to get a not-so-crystal point across. Look them in the eye. Be there in mind, spirit, and body.

, If you've never thought about your walk before, it's time to start. In fact, it's time to experiment! Your mind takes cues from your body, so you may even feel the confidence ooze through you when you walk more confidently. Go on, try it!


Walk back and forth across the room with your head held a bit above 90 degrees and your shoulders back. Walk at a moderate pace. How's it feel?
Now walk back and forth across the room with your head down and your shoulders hunched over a bit. Walk slowly. At the end of your walk, hold that position. How do things feel different?

, A huge part in engaging with people, in showing them that you're listening and that you care, is eye contact. Plenty of nice guys don't get the girl because they can't look at her, plenty of salesmen don't make the sale because their sideways glances give them away, and plenty of people don't seem confident and put together because they're too afraid to make that connection. People see you regardless of whether or not you're looking at them, so why not look back?


For the record, there's a huge difference between eye contact and staring. A good rule of thumb is to look at the person (and do blink!) while they're making a point. If you're responding, switch it up a little, or if the conversation is breezy or they're gesturing, give your eyeballs some literal wiggle room.

, Okay, so when it comes to presence, clothes don't make the man. That being said, having the right wardrobe is the first filter people put you through when they're taking you in. So while clothes won't give you presence, they'll get you through the door, where the presence is sitting in a bowl by the window.


It's not about wearing brand names. It's not about suits and dresses. It's mostly about being put together and well-groomed. If you've showered, shaved, put on some deodorant, and dressed in decent clothes with the light on, you should be okay.

, If you've read the first two sections, you probably already have an idea of how to do this. It means putting your phone down, engaging with your body language, having showered in the recent past, and just grounding yourself in the moment. It's called ""presence"" for a reason. You can't have presence if you don't show up!


Connect to the moment. Think of it as your moment. If you're on stage, the stage is yours, this moment is yours, and this character is you. There's nothing to worry about. You're there in mind, body, and spirit. There's no panel of judges, there's no fight with your boyfriend, there's no football game on TV, there's just now where you are.

, Don't give them the satisfaction. A person with presence is always cool, calm, and collected. When everyone else is pulling their hair out with stress, you're the one getting things done with a smile on your face. You do this stuff in your sleep. You eat this stuff for breakfast. No biggie. Nothing can shake you.


This goes double if your presence is onstage or in front of a camera. Any nervousness, any agitation will be seen or captured. You've probably seen an actor who couldn't seem to commit to an action or behavior because they were too busy overthinking it, worrying what was correct. When you start sweating, you've already lost confidence in you, and others will shortly follow suit.

, This is a problem for most of us, especially women. We're taught to say, ""I think maybe this will help the problem,"" instead of, ""Here's the solution."" We qualify our words and say ""I'm sorry"" as a casual starter to any sentence. Don't bother! While these things can be tactful at times, they can also be unnecessary at others. If you're looking to show you're confident in you, you want to abandon the lingual niceties.


If your boss were to say, ""You know, I was thinking that perhaps we should go in a different direction. I know it'll be a huge convenience and I'm so sorry, but I really think this is a good idea, don't you?"", how would you interpret that? Now if they were to say, ""Guys. Listen up. We gotta go in a different direction. It's gonna be work, but it'll be worth it. Whaddaya say?"" How would you interpret that? Bingo.

, You know that awkward first date where the conversation kinda hits a lull and both parties scramble to find something interesting to say to kill the awkward silence? Don't. Don't worry about it. You want 'em hanging on your every word -- if you're talking the entire time, they're gonna be hanging on the edge of their seats so they're closer to the door. So choose your words. They're more powerful that way.

, Every word out of your mouth should be audible. Don't let your sentences trail off like.... See how terrible that is?! You believe in your words, so there's no need to hide them. Speak clearly so you can be heard. Otherwise why bother talking?


Let's take that same example: ""Guys. Listen up. We gotta go in a different direction. It's gonna be work, but it'll be worth it. Whaddaya say?"" Good! That's good stuff. Now imagine it like this, ""Uhh, hey, guys. Listen up. We, like gotta go in a different, um, direction. Yeah. Uhh, it's gonna be, you know, work and stuff, but it'll be worth it."" That's a big fat no. Don't hem and haw! You're confident in your point, so spit it out!

, You may lie on your back on the floor or otherwise place yourself in a comfortable position. Make sure that nothing will distract you (unplug your phone, close your door, ask people not to disturb you, etc.).

, Allow your breath to fall in and out of you, unobstructed. Notice any place where your breath begins to catch. Allow your breath to touch that place until it opens and relaxes.


Be sure not to judge your observations. Allow yourself to be in the state you are in. Also know that your state is flexible and can change.

, Start from the top of your head and move your way down. Are you lifting your brow? Are you holding your eyes closed too tightly? Are you flaring your nostrils? Are you curling your lips in? Are you pulling your mouth into a frown? Are you pulling your mouth into a smile? Is your jaw relaxed? Is your neck relaxed?

, Imagine that you are delivering all of the oxygen from your breath straight to the point on your face that is tense.


Continue until your entire face and neck are relaxed. You should feel your sinuses open up and your circulation become better (your may feel more warmth or tingling in your skin). Your expression may feel very different. Do not judge yourself, just notice what you notice.

, Allow each point of tension to be filled with your breath. Allow these places to open and relax. Pay close attention to the state of your body as this tells you a lot about how you move through the world.


If at any time that you are studying your new body, you feel tensions creeping back, take another deep breath and release this tension.

, You may be shocked because you look a little different. Do not do anything, just observe how you have changed.

, They may comment that you look a little different. Your voice may sound different as well. You may seem more confident, more calm. Don't let this disturb you. If you feel the tension creeping back, take a deep, silent breath and release the tension again.


While you are talking to your friend or family member, allow yourself to be expressive with your face as well as your body, but don't get stuck in an expression. Always attempt to return to a natural, relaxed position.

, People may comment that you look a little different. Do not be discouraged.


It is likely that tensions will return. Just be sure not to judge yourself. This is a process and is different for each person. Notice the tension and allow yourself to release it.

, Don't force yourself to react in a particular way, just allow an expression to move through your body. Check in afterwards, did your smile stick? Did the tension return to your face or body? Practice this until you remain relaxed when you greet strangers.


In all situations, it is important to maintain your presence. If you have anxiety or fear, acknowledge it and allow yourself to move through it. Turn your focus to your breath and breathe out any tension.

Do not sing a pop song or just any music that is not from a play.",How to Audition for a Youth Musical2," If they've requested you to sing a specific one, do that one. If you get to choose here are some guidelines for picking an audition song:


Choose a song with a similar style to the show you're auditioning for, but the song shouldn't be from that show.
Choose a song that shows off your vocal range (how high or low you can sing), but make sure it doesn't go so high or so low that you can't sing it well.
Avoid a song that's too commonly used for auditions. You want to stand out! Avoid Amazing Grace, as it is very overused for auditions.
Determine the best type of song for you. If you're a younger kid, you might be better off singing a faster, upbeat song. If you're an older kid or a teenager, you'll want to sing a slower song.

, Once you've chosen your song, you need to get to know it really well. Once you really know it, you can start having fun with it!


Listen to different versions of the song for ideas, but don't try to mimic exactly another version. Make it your own!
Learn the notes! It may seem obvious, but the director wants to hear that you are a strong confident singer, which you can't be if you don't know every note.
Read the lyrics a few times. Think about what the character is saying, feeling, and what their motivation is. You might want to consider highlighting lyrics where the feelings are really intense or when the character's emotions seem to change.

, During your song, the directors aren't just looking for how well you can sing. They're also looking to see how well you move onstage and if you have good stage presence. Think of the singing part of your audition as an addition to the acting part of your audition, but with notes and rhythm.


Add movement! Remember, movement doesn't mean dancing. The directors don't want a full-on dance number, but feel free to walk around onstage and to use gestures. Make sure any movements you do make sense with the lyrics and the character's emotions. Try not to illustrate every word, though - just do what you think the character would do while singing their song.
Act with your voice! Sing loud if the character is angry, soft if the character is sad, and so on. Sometimes you might even want to speak a word or phrase if you think it adds to your performance.
Use facial expressions. During your song use your eyes and eyebrows to convey your message. Use your mouth too, for smiling and such, but make sure that your facial expressions don't interfere with your sound.

, During your song, make sure you are always facing out, so the directors can see and hear you. Also, you need to project so they can hear you, because they're usually at the back of the theater. Projecting means to be loud. You can do this by taking big breaths and keeping your throat and mouth really open. Just make sure you don't belt. Belting is basically screaming and singing at the same time and it's not good for young voices.

, That will seem unprofessional and juvenile. Don't sing a song that is way above the appropriate age for you. If you aren't into musicals, research. Find something that you want to do or you can relate to.

Prepare for the big day.,
Take advantage of time.,
Prepare ahead of time.",How to Audition for a Youth Musical3," You will probably have to do a monologue or a cold reading at your audition.


Prepare for a cold reading. A cold reading is when you receive an excerpt of the script at our audition and are asked to read for a specific role, either with the director or another person auditioning.
A monologue is a long line (almost like a paragraph) said by one character. You may have to choose a monologue from another show or you may be given a specific monologue to perform.

, During the cold reading, you may be given a bit of time to prepare. If this is the case, make sure to focus on long words or words that are hard to pronounce. When you perform the cold reading, remember to project and to face out. Use expression in your voice and feel free to use gestures and to move around the stage. Even though you probably won't have the chance to memorize any of the lines, try to look up from the script frequently so that the director can see your face. The cold reading is a good chance to try out a character voice or an accent, as long as it seems to fit the character. You might, however, want to ask the director first.

, If you are asked to perform a monologue, you will probably have the chance to practice it at home. If you have to choose one, choose one said by a character similar to the one you are hoping to get, but don't choose a monologue from the show you're auditioning for. Make sure you project and face out during your monologue!


Practice and practice again. Practice the monologue over and over again until it's memorized. This shows professionalism.
Use color. Color code your monologue according to the character's different emotions.
Including any movement. Add blocking and business (movement and gestures) to your performance.

"
"
Just relax.Don't worry too much about the dance part of the audition.",How to Audition for a Youth Musical4," Just remember to smile and look like you know what you're doing, even if you don't. When you're learning the dance try to be in front, so that you're seeing the choreographer doing the moves - not the person in front of you. If you make a mistake during your dance, don't make a big deal about it. Just keep going and act like it was part of the dance. Also, try not to look at the people dancing around you if you're auditioning in a group because it makes you seem like you don't know what you're doing. It's okay if not every move is perfect - just look like you're having fun!

"
"
Dress the part.,
Don't worry!",How to Audition for a Youth Musical5," For your audition, you'll want to wear the appropriate attire.


Try not to come in costume! If you want a certain part, you could subtly hint at that role by wearing your hair a similar way or by wearing a similar color, but do not come in costume because that could make you look desperate and it could make for an embarrassing situation if you don't get that role.
Wear comfortable clothing, especially if you will have to dance.
Wear simple clothing. Try to avoid intricate designs, long text or glitter and sparkles. They will only focus on the designs instead of your performance.
Girls - you probably shouldn't wear a dress/skirt to the audition unless you have tights or leggings underneath.
Make sure you are wearing appropriate footwear. Don't wear heels (unless they're character shoes). They can be very tricky to dance in and they won't give the director an accurate view of your height. If you wish, you can bring jazz shoes or character shoes to your audition.
Example: jeans/leggings, a blank, solid-colored shirt (Any type could work), comfortable, plain shoes.

, You'll do fine. Take deep breaths before the audition to help calm your nerves. You might also want to chew on gum before your audition to reduce stress, as long as you throw it away before you enter the audition room. Make sure to bring water or tea - and a lot. You need to be really hydrated before your audition. Do not, however, drink coffee because it can damage your voice. Avoid milk as well, as it coats your throat which produces a different voice than your usual one.

"
"
Breathe in and breathe out.,
When its done, its done.,
Once you've been cast in the show, it's time to get busy!",How to Audition for a Youth Musical6," Take a few breaths before you go onstage. Then, just perform your very best and show them what you can do!


When you get onstage, tell the directors your name, age, and what you will be performing.
Perform loudly and face out.
Make everything you do bigger onstage. Small gestures and movements don't read well from the back of the theater.
If you mess up, just keep going and pretend it didn't happen. If you don't make a big deal about it, the directors probably won't even notice.
After your audition, thank the director for their time before leaving.

, After your audition, don't worry too much - there's nothing you can do now. Try to distract yourself with a book or playing games at home until the call-back list or the cast list is announced.

, Each and every role is essential to telling a story onstage. If you get a small role don't be disappointed and if you get a large role don't be cocky. Also, remember that if you didn't get the role you hoped for, it may not be because you didn't do well - it may be just because you didn't seem to be the right fit for the role. Sometimes, you just have to be persistent and keep auditioning for more shows and learning until you get your dream role!

Swear like an Englishman.",How to Make People Believe You're British," ""The British"" (also called Britons) live anywhere in the United Kingdom, a nation that includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. If you use ""English"" and ""British"" interchangeably, drop that habit right away.


""Great Britain"" refers to the UK's larger island — England, Scotland, and Wales only.
The Republic of Ireland is an independent nation on the same island as Northern Ireland.;
, People joke about British food, but many consider this reputation undeserved in modern times. In large cities especially, there are many great food options. Here are a few favorites that are particularly British:



Indian curry, especially chicken tikka masala

Cornish pasties and meat pies


English Tea (both the drink and the meal.)
Regional specialties abound, from Irish soda bread to Devonshire cream

If you are not in Britain, visit international food markets to look for imported goods. British cheese, biscuits, and chocolate are found worldwide.

, Watch Sherlock Holmes, the Inbetweeners, Downton Abbey, Misfits, IT Crowd, Coronation Street and other films and shows. This is one of the most entertaining ways to get a sneak peek at British culture, including their sense of humour.


British television (especially the BBC) is available in many countries, although usually only as a reduced and older selection. Monty Python is fantastic, but try to find shows from this decade as well.

, The United Kingdom runs on a parliamentary system, with most seats held by the Conservative and Labour parties — with a recent surge by the Scottish National party. If you've never heard of these before, try following prime minister question time, British political news, or British political comedians.


If you've never heard of these parties before, just teach yourselves the basics of their positions. Faking an opinion is difficult and somewhat insulting.

, Football (called soccer in the US and Canada) is a national obsession — which you probably knew unless you're from the few countries where it isn't. Learn to play the game and follow a team from afar, if you enjoy sports. Rugby and cricket are popular as well.

, Now you know a tiny taste of British culture. But where do you feel a special connection to? Slang and diets can change over remarkably short distances, and across social classes. Try researching Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff, or Belfast.

, People in Britain tend to dress more casually than continental Europeans, but more formally than casual dress in the United States. Jeans, T-shirts, and jumpers (sweaters) are common, but they're usually in good shape and fit well. Bold color and pattern combinations are common in some areas, but black is a safe option until you've got the local fashion down.When in doubt, shop in Britain itself. Look for stores filled mostly by locals, including some roughly similar to your demographic.
Formal wear tends to be modest and custom-tailored, but it's best to check with the host of the event.
Younger adults and teenagers tend to follow faster-changing fashion trends, so you may see young locals that break these ""rules.""

, There are some items of clothing or accessories used mostly by tourists. Stay away from these if you want any hope of looking British:


Fanny packs/bum bags
Cameras and maps
Hiker's clothing in the city (including hiking boots)
T-shirts sold to tourists, often with the Union Jack or the Keep Calm, Carry On slogan.
Shorts and running shoes are not unheard of, but they will draw more attention than they would in other parts of the world.

, It's often cold in England, so women have learned to wear scarves, boots, and definitely tights (which Americans may know as pantyhose). Even rain boots have their place! A dress or pinafore with tights, a blazer, and plimsolls would not be out of the question. Men have fewer fashion expectations, but should definitely pack warm and rainproof clothing.

, When greeting someone, offer a brief, firm handshake with no further contact. Don't be surprised if someone gives you a brief hug or kiss on the cheek instead — but don't initiate it yourself unless they've done so before.Any of the following are a fine way to start the conversation:


Good morning / good afternoon / good evening
Hello, how are you?

(informal) Morning / afternoon / evening(very informal) Alright? / Alright, mate?

, Tourists tend to commit unintended faux pas in any country. Here are a few vital rules to follow in British etiquette:


When invited somewhere, arrive exactly on time. If you'll be more than a couple minutes late, call and apologize.
Unless you're in a pub, queue (wait in line) in single file and wait patiently for your turn. (At a pub, walk up to the bar and wait patiently there!)
Be sensitive to signs of discomfort in conversation. Depending on where you're from, you may need to learn to give other people more space, reduce prolonged eye contact, and minimize physical contact. Most British people will not voice their discomfort aloud.
Tipping is only expected in certain situations, such as taxis and beauty salons. Restaurant tipping is optional and usually around 10%. At a pub, offer to buy the bartender a drink instead., Humour is one of the most difficult cultural elements to translate, even if you're from an English-speaking country. Plenty of Brits have a quick, dry wit with an edge of self-deprecation. Be prepared for sarcasm, insults, swearing, and puns that go over your head, all delivered with a straight face and the expectation that you'll roll your eyes and move on. Succeeding with your own contribution is very difficult for a foreigner, but one of the best ways to show that you belong in British culture, at least a little bit.

, No culture can be reduced to a few pages, and you shouldn't assume everyone in Britain behaves as described above. After all, Britain contains four countries, dozens of regions with strong local identities, and an ongoing history of immigration, all with a proud place in British society.

, Your accent is probably your biggest obstacle in the way of your British disguise. Changing it, however, will be very tough. Pranking an American is one thing, but maintaining a longterm facade is nearly impossible. And you'd better have plenty of practice before trying it in Britain.

, There are many British accents, and very few of them sound like an English rom com. If you're acting in a play, find out where your character is from and what social class he belongs to. If you're learning the accent just for fun, find one that's similar to your native accent.


Almost all US English speakers have an easier time learning southern English accents. Northern English (such as Geordie and Scouser), Scottish, Irish, and Welsh accents have less familiar sounds.
If English is not your native language, try to find out whether the UK has an immigrant population of people from your country. London especially has many dialects that borrow heavily from other accents, from Jamaican to Polish.

, Every English-speaking country has differences in sentence structure and grammar, though usually only slight ones. Here are a few examples which could sound unfamiliar, depending on where you're from:


In response to a question with an auxiliary and main verb, Brits respond with both: ""Could you do the washing up for me?"" ""Could do"" or ""will do"".
""Have you got...?"" instead of ""Do you have...?""
Brits use the past perfect (""I have eaten"") frequently, where others might use the past simple (""I ate"").
Brits sometimes drop the definite article — ""at/in hospital,"" instead of ""at the hospital.""

, We all speak with certain mouth shapes and tongue movements unconsciously. Overwriting these takes concentrated practice in front of a mirror. The most well-known British accent, for example — spoken by politicians and BBC newscasters — relies on a dropped jaw and lips that open more vertically than horizontally.Find online videos for the accent you chose, or a conversation partner from that region.

, Though the language is English, it can sound very different from American, Australian, South African, or any other dialect of English. Online dictionaries of slang and other differences will give you a head start, as will talking to native Brits in online language-learning forums. Here are a few examples of American-British differences:


You eat ""sweets"" and ""biscuits"", not candy and cookies. French fries are ""chips"", potato chips are ""crisps"", and the British love all four of these.
Pants are ""trousers.""
The restroom is the ""loo"" or ""toilet.""
Watch out for words such as ""fanny"" that have different and offensive meanings.
""Asian"" usually correlates to South(west) Asia: Indian, Pakistani, etc. People from China, Japan, and the rest of Southeast Asia are often called ""Oriental"" and ""Far Eastern.""

, You can have the vocabulary and the accent down pat, but it won't be totally convincing to a native Brit if you don't have the slang and the interjections. Language is so much more than how to string a sentence together! Keep in mind that using slang incorrectly is worse than not using it at all.


Interjections are going to make or break your ability to pull off an English accent. Without the ability to ponder and react in a natural way, you're done for. E.g.: Hello! Ah, oh, hmm, well, huh, etc.
Say ""I fancy"" instead of ""I want,"" and ""I am shattered"" instead of ""I am tired."" These are just a few examples of a practically infinite list.
Use the expression ""Alright?"" or ""You alright?"" which is often used instead of ""Hello, how are you?"" This isn't an actual question, really. You'd respond with the same, ""Alright?"" or ""I'm good, thanks,"" regardless of how you actually feel.

, There are quite a few British spellings that are not used in the US, and sometimes not even in the rest of the Commonwealth. For example, ""colour"", ""criticise"", ""aluminium"", and ""learnt"" are all correct British spellings.


There are a few punctuation differences as well. ""Mr"" does not end in a period and short quotes tend to end with the final punctuation outside the quotation marks (as in the list of spellings above).

, We won't list the terminology here, but it's not hard to find examples online. Know that those few words you probably resort to may have completely different connotations in British English — more casual, more offensive, or not used at all. Learn the differences from a native Brit instead (and don't choose Hagrid).

, No one else is watching you, you're alone on the set, practicing your lines.

,, Try to fool the others into thinking you aren't embarrassed at all, and you may end up fooling yourself as well.

, Take a deep breath before walking on set, calm yourself, and tell yourself that you're a great actor, and there's no reason to be embarrassed about your acting.

If you live in Chicago, your agent should be Chicago-based. Although it may be tempting to have an agent half a world away, where actors and agents are commonplace, your agent needs to be able to communicate with you quickly and effectively. This is far more difficult to do if there is a large distance between the two of you.If you live in a small town, there may not be an agency in the immediate vicinity. In this case, search in the city closest to you.
To truly make it in the acting business, a move may be required. Although not every actor must live in Los Angeles or New York, living in a large city will lend itself to a successful career far more than living in a little town will.;
, Don’t immediately hire the first agent you meet with. There are a wide range of communication and solicitation styles, and you need to find an agent you get along with, and build a trusting relationship. Set up interviews with multiple agents across several agencies.Ask questions. Is your agent representing anyone else? Does your agent currently have any successful clients--or have they had any in the past? Is there a particular realm of acting your agent specializes in, such as stage, television, or film?
Let the agents you are interviewing know that you are interviewing others, as it can help keep pricing negotiations low, and will avoid creating false expectations.

, Although your agent is, in effect, working for you, they need to know that you are a legitimate client, and that you can be successful. When searching for an agent, treat it as though you are also interviewing for a job. While you need to find an agent you can trust, you also need to be able to bring something to the table for an agent to take an interest in your goals.Do not inflate your resume. If you don’t have any experience, communicate this to your prospective agent. If the agency does not accept individuals with no experience, they may be able to refer you to a smaller agency better suited to your immediate needs.

, Not every talent agent is going to mesh well with you, nor are you going to like every agent you run into. If your goal is to develop a thriving stage acting career, you need an agent familiar with stage acting, not an agent well-versed in television auditions. Make your wants and needs clear from the outset, and research the agent or agency that will best suit your goals.


Don’t immediately dismiss an agent you get along well with because they don’t have a lot of experience in your chosen field--particularly if you don’t have a lot of experience, yourself. They may be able to help you just as much, and may be far more eager to prove themselves.

, Finding the right agent for you may take some time. If you have met with numerous agencies and still can’t find a good match, be patient. Consider looking outside of your immediate area to surrounding towns or cities. Your agent is going to be a long-time partner as you build your resume and portfolio; you want someone reliable and trustworthy. This is not the time to make hasty, ill-researched decisions.This is also true of current agent relationships; if you find that your agent is no longer doing their job properly, or that the two of you are no longer compatible, sever the working relationship and search for an agent better suited to your needs.

, Each audition you go on, you will be required to present your resume, either attached to your headshot, or printed directly on the back of your headshot. Make sure your resume is relevant. If any of your non-acting jobs are relevant to the part you are auditioning for, feel free to include these. If not, however, avoid them. Your resume should not be bogged down by every single job you’ve ever held.


Keep your resume to a single page. If it extends past one page, simplify your descriptions. If your jobs extend past one page, file them down to the most relevant ones.

, Failing to do so will set you apart in a way you certainly don’t want. Enlist the help of a professional photographer, and get good-quality, professional headshots made.Keep your headshot simple. Clean lines, a simple shirt, and a classic hairstyle will be best. Allow your age, coloring, and any perceived “flaws” to be seen; casting directors need to know what you look like. If your headshot contains wild colors, props, or garish lighting, the effect will be more jarring than memorable.

, Although you can certainly waltz in and audition for a leading role, the likelihood of being chosen with no experience is low. Start small, and gradually work your way up, simultaneously building your confidence and familiarity with the industry.If you are seeking a break into film or television, audition for single-line parts or even background parts. This way, you can familiarize yourself with television and film sets, the process of producing, and the process of acting on screen.
If stage is your goal, start by auditioning for a chorus line, or even apply to be a stage hand. Again, this will give you a window into your chosen profession, and will allow you to make friends and gain insight into the acting process.

, Auditions are not the time to act on a whim. Before you audition, learn everything you can about the character and project. Know your character’s basic physical characteristics, as well as their background. Familiarize yourself as much as possible with the director, source material, and storyline.Step into the part. Your audition is not a time to be you; it is, instead, a time for you to step into the shoes of your character. Take this time to truly embody the character you are auditioning for. Remember: the casting board is not looking for your personality--they are looking for the character’s ideal fit.
If you are attending a cold read, advance preparation is not going to be possible. When you receive your script for a cold read, quickly scan through and determine who you are, where you are, and the overall feel of your character. Use gestures, inflection, and facial expressions to deliver a strong impression of the character in question.

, Not every audition is going to result in a part, or even a call back. Although it can be discouraging, try again. Every time you can, go in and audition. Make your face a familiar one among casting companies and audition halls. Consistency and tenacity are both important factors in breaking into the acting business., When you start out, every role is important. Whether your resume is on paper, via a website, or via a film reel, you want your presence to be felt. Once you have a few roles under your belt, you can begin to streamline your portfolio.Although acting is a creative career, be professional in creating your resume. While your personality might be powerful, you want the casting board to know you are a professional. Treat your resume and portfolio accordingly.

, Although it can be helpful to show how versatile you are, tailor your portfolio to your job whenever possible. You do not have to delete numerous roles to fit the atmosphere of the project you are auditioning for; instead, try to keep similar genres grouped together.If you only have a few shows to demonstrate your talent, that is fine. Include all of your roles and what they entailed.
If you have numerous roles you have acted in, begin to pare down your portfolio, using only the roles you want to continue playing. This will give casting directors and your agent a better idea of roles that will fit you and your goals.

, Acting has many faces. If you have acted in a television commercial, on the stage, and in film, include all of these in your portfolio. If you have enough experience to edit your roles down to a tailored portfolio, great! Use as many mediums as you can within that pared-down framework.Don’t be afraid to do commercials if you want to be a stage actor, and don’t shy away from the stage if your ultimate goal is film. Any type of acting can provide you with invaluable experience.

, A website is a simple way to showcase your talent and portfolio. There are many inexpensive web hosting services, and even some free ones. If you do not want to create an entire website, be sure to be active on social media under your given name.Blogs and YouTube channels can also be helpful in making yourself known. A blog can simply detail your experiences as you work to break into the acting world, while a channel can provide a way for you to highlight any film, television, or commercial roles you’ve had.

, The key to networking is persistence and assertiveness. Whenever possible, introduce yourself to your peers and superiors. Make sure your name is known and has a positive association; you don’t want to be remembered as the person who elbowed their way to say hello to a famous actor.When you introduce yourself, explain who you are and what you are doing. If you are a stagehand, identify yourself as such. While you might feel silly introducing yourself to the highest rung on the so-called ladder, while you are the lowest rung, few people will be angry or annoyed by a quick, polite “hello.”

, Part of networking is making human connections. Share the story of how you got into acting, or your unique background, and display a genuine interest in the stories of others. Everyone, from stagehands and camera crew members, to the directors and producers, wants to be heard. Lend a listening ear, and watch your network grow.Although you should share, and should ask questions, beware launching into a soliloquy. If need be, practice what you might say to others about your motivation and background.
Showing interest and being nosy are two very different things. Ask others questions about themselves, but do not press if they are not comfortable providing details.

, Keep the numbers and contact information of the people you’ve worked with. Make sure you are forging a relationship with the people around you. Few loners make it in the acting industry, so don’t be afraid to go out, mingle, and catch up with old coworkers.Be respectful of your time, too; you do not have to go to parties and get-togethers every single night to stay relevant. Instead, put in appearances where you feel you would be appreciated, or at parties with mutual friends.

, Be a helpful person on set, not a diva. Work hard, and make sure you are taking the wants and needs of others into account. Part of having a solid network is being an asset to others.


Offer to help people run lines, have conversations with crew members, and perform a kind gesture or two during your time working on a project. You can do something as small as bringing in a mixed bagel box--it will not go unnoticed.

, Ask for help when you need it. If a trusted acquaintance is a staff member at a powerful agency, kindly ask for tips on how to catch the agency’s eye. If a beloved friend is working on the set of a movie, ask if any positions need to be filled.Do not demand help. Requesting a few pointers or an introduction is one thing; demanding aid is something else entirely. If you have not spoken to an old coworker in 8 months, it is not appropriate to contact them, asking for a job.
Networks, while helpful, are not the equivalent of a pool of servants. While people may be happy to help you or provide you with favors, never expect anything of a friend or coworker.

, Extend the courtesy of doing favors to others. If a valued coworker asks you to write a reference letter or act as a standing reference, say yes (provided you had positive experiences with the person in question). You should never treat your networking aims as though you live in a vacuum. You, too, play an integral role in networking, and you, too, have something to bring to the table."

Observe.,
Try to build a story behind every person's action.,
Talk less and observe more.,
Observe yourself.,
Do a mirror exercise.,
Create a space that will allow you to act out in.",How to Act with Your Own Style," Observation is the first and foremost step in acting. Observe everything around you. It may be the beggar beside your road or the business person who is always on a call. It is important to view ordinary people doing everyday things, so that you can try to ""get into their skin"" so to speak and truly find what might motivate or drive that person.;
, For example, think about how a person is reacting such a way because he or she is going through a certain phase in their life. What might that phase be? It could be transitioning from one job to another, from teen years to adulthood, from middle age to old age, from school to college, from feeling sorry for themselves to seizing opportunities, from having a loved one in their life to losing that person, and so forth. Trying to figure out what is behind the things people are going through will help to increase your empathy and your ability to understand that people, and the things they do in life, are complex but also fundamentally observable.

, It is perfectly fine to ask questions to get more facts, but try to do a lot more observing, regarding and watching. Learn to spot the things that are giveaways about a person's mood, such as tears, sniffling with a handkerchief, eating quickly or slowly, rushing somewhere or dawdling, hugging or withdrawing from a kiss, doodling or staring out of a window, always on the phone or switching it off when it rings, and so on. There are many signs people show about their mood and intentions if you care to look closely.

, By doing this, you will understand what is your own way of doing things.


Put yourself in the same situations as the people you've observed. Observe what you do, what is driving or motivating you and how you respond to particular situations.
Reflect what you did after every minor action.
Try to put yourself in various situations and see how you would react.

, This is one of the most effective exercises to do in acting.


Stand in front of the mirror. Observe how your face looks, put yourself in the third person's point of view and imagine how XYZ would probably see you.
Imagine the situation which you saw and try to do the same actions in front of the mirror.
Try reading a text or a poem in a dramatic tone, describing a story maybe.

, Keep a camera on, recording your actions at all times in a chosen private space. The recording device could be a smartphone, even. In this space, act out in front of nobody, then watch the recording later. This will help you to see what you do naturally and what you do by way of acting out, allowing you to continue to improvise and make changes in your style as you go. This can be a really good way to improve on your acting techniques and to learn how to capture the personalities and styles of other persons, building on your observations from above and your empathetic translations.

Cut some onions.,
Smear some toothpaste beneath your eyes.,
Trigger an eye-watering response with peppermint oil.,
Apply a menthol cream or wax.,
Use eucalyptus to get your eyes watering.,
Use eye drops or saline solution.",How to Make Your Eyes Water1," Onions soak up sulfur from the soil when growing, and when you chop them up, you break open cells in the onion and release enzymes that mix with the sulfur. This creates an invisible gas that causes a burning sensation in your eyes, causing you to tear up without crying.


Chop some onions and linger over them. Some people are more sensitive than others; you may only need to cut a little bit of the onion, or you may need to really linger.
Cooked onions do not produce this effect.
Refrigerated onions and onions doused with water as you cut them will also fail to make your eyes water.
Sweet onions, like Vidalia onions, often don’t produce as strong a watering effect in your eyes as stronger white or yellow onions.;
, You should be careful when doing this; getting toothpaste directly in your eye will sting. However, if you rub a small amount on your lower eyelid, your eyes will try to flush the toothpaste with watering eyes.


You may have to wait a few moments before your eyes respond to your application of toothpaste.
Most common toothpastes should work for the purposes of making your eyes water as most toothpastes contain sodium lauryl sulfate, a known eye irritant.
All natural toothpastes, or toothpastes missing the ingredient sodium lauryl sulfate, may not work as well for making your eyes water., Products that contain peppermint can cause a stinging sensation in the eyes, resulting in you tearing up. Take a small amount and apply it beneath your eye to create a watering effect.


You’ll have to experiment with how much peppermint oil you use. Some individuals will be more sensitive to it than others.
Avoid getting the oil in your eyes, as it can create stinging, redness, and discomfort., Menthol, or compounds that contain menthol, are widely available at drug stores and are generally inexpensive. You can dab small amount of menthol cream below your eyes to cause your eyes to tear up.


You might also make use of a tear stick, which is much like lip balm infused with menthol and camphor to make you tear up. Simply smear a small amount under each eye, and you should feel its effects., The compounds in eucalyptus have an invigorating effect on your body, opening sinuses, refreshing the lungs, and even flushing the eyes. A common stage trick some actors use for watery eyes needed at the beginning of a scene involves other actors blowing eucalyptus vapor gently into their eyes. This might work for you as well!, While this technique won’t make your eyes water for very long, it’s a very effective short term measure. If you can disguise the motion of inserting eye drops or saline solution into your eye from onlookers, when you turn back, the excess solution will make it appear as though your eyes are watering.


Saline solution is a liquid solution formulated to be about the same as the tears that wet your eye making this a safe and practical way of making your eyes look teary.
Saline solution and eye drops can be found at most drug stores."
"
Rub the area beneath your eyes gently.,
Dry out your eyes by staring.,
Grasp your upper eyelid and your lower eyelid by the lashes and pull.,
Yawn.,
Look into the lights.",How to Make Your Eyes Water2," Be sure you don’t overdo this eye-watering technique. Your eye is made up of many delicate parts, and rubbing too hard can cause damage, especially if done over a long period of time.


Be aware that this trick sets up a chain reaction that can lead to stinging eyes, creating a bloodshot appearance.
You should only do this with clean hands to prevent the introduction of germs into your eyes., Your eyes’ natural response to dryness is to water to rehydrate and protect each eye. By keeping your eyes open for an extended period of time, your eye will become dry and start to water. You might even turn this into a game with a friend and have a starting contest., The stinging sensation caused by pulling on your lashes or pulling out your lashes should make your eyes water nicely. Though you shouldn’t intentionally pull out your lashes, you don’t have to worry if you do. Eyelashes, contrary to common belief, do grow back., When you yawn, the tension of the muscles in your eyes and face cause your tear ducts to close off for its duration. This causes a slight surge of fluid (tears) once you are finished and your yawning muscles relax. If you can make yourself yawn, your eyes should water., Though you shouldn’t stare into bright lights for long periods of time, as this can be harmful to your vision, some actors have used bright lights to trigger their eyes water. A famous example of this is actor Henry Fonda, who would often stare into bright lights when he needed to water up on stage."
"
Imagine things you find sad.,
Use muscle memory to trigger teary eyes.,
Assume a teary-eyed persona.,
Find your power phrase.,
Think about sad music.",How to Make Your Eyes Water3," If your goal is to get your waterworks started, you may have to go over the top in your imagining. Usually, there is at least one thing, like mistreated animals or impoverished children, that you can’t help getting sad over. Use these to water up! Some other ideas that might get you teary-eyed include:


War
Starvation
Disease
Death, Try to assume the position you were in at a time when you were teary-eyed for some reason. Then, as closely as you are able, mimic the motions, rate of breathing, and noises you made at that time. Though this might seem a little awkward, with practice your body’s muscle memory can be trained to activate your tear glands to water your eyes., You don’t have to be an actor to make use of actor’s tricks. By identifying with a character, either an imaginary one or a live-action one you’ve seen on TV, you can make yourself misty eyed.


Try to choose a character whose situation you can relate to. Relatable characters will make it easier for you to slip into their mindset, and from there, get the watering response going., Some phrases may have the ability to really upset you. Professional actors and acting teachers refer to this as a “power phrase” due to the fact that it can be used to give you power over your emotions. Simply repeat the phrase to yourself until you feel your eyes begin to moisten. Some examples of power phrases include:


”I’m not good enough.”
”No one will ever love me.”
”I can’t do anything right.”
”Why does everybody leave me?”, Music can evoke a powerful emotion response inside of you, both in negative and positive ways. Think of a song that you find particularly depressing, and loop it in your head. You may also want to think about things you find sad or depressing as the music plays in your head.


To help yourself get into the mood to cue your eye watering, you might want to bring some headphones and a music player so you can listen to the sad song before you need your eyes to water.
When it’s time to water up, take off the headphones and continue playing the song in your head until your tear glands begin to water."

Gather material for making a belly.,
Make a belly out of items around the house.,
Create easy pregnant breasts for men.,
Get the physicality right.,
Work on acting out the hormonal changes.,
Practice while wearing your pregnant belly.,
Wear the belly at every rehearsal.",How to Look Pregnant," Even though it’s possible to look pregnant with some other styles of clothing, maternity clothing is best suited to the shape you need to be. Check thrift stores for maternity clothing, which will probably be the cheapest. If you don’t have any luck, both Walmart and Old Navy sell cheap maternity clothing.;
, Some of your own clothing might work for looking pregnant. If you have a pair of pants you’re willing to sacrifice, you can even convert your pants into maternity wear. Look through your closet and choose pieces with the following attributes, all of which could be worn successfully with a fake belly:Shirts or dresses with an empire waist
Tent dresses or muumuus
Drawstring pants
Loose skirts with an elastic waist (that can be pulled below the belly)

, If you haven’t gotten yours yet, consider taking some clothing to wad up under the maternity clothing as you try them on. If you’re at a store that sells new maternity clothing, it’s possible that they will have a fake belly. You can then try on the clothing with the belly underneath to get a sense of how it’s going to fit. Since your weight is going to be in the belly and breasts, those are the areas that need to be loose.

, If you’re going to purchase a belly, you’re going to have a number of choices. On the cheaper end, many novelty and costume stores have cheap pregnant bellies that you can get. They’re easy to find around Halloween. If you’re wanting to spend more – if you are working for a costume shop and know it’s going to be used multiple times in different productions – there are a few different options.If the belly is going to be seen, it’s probably best to purchase a silicone model. It will look realistic and be the right texture and color.
If it’s going to be under clothing and worn for long periods, a fabric belly will probably most comfortable.

, If you work in a costume shop and are familiar with sewing and/or modeling, you can make a very convincing belly. If you’ve decided you’d rather make a belly, you have a few options available. Sewing a fake belly model is a good option if you’re handy with a sewing machine. If you are skilled at making latex models, it might be easy for you to make a fake belly yourself., One way to do this is with a tank top that’s a few sizes too big and a basketball. It’s not going to stay in place that well but can work if you’re not moving around much and just need a brief sight gag.


Place a basketball under the singlet
Stretch the singlet to cover the whole basketball
Pull your pants up and stretch it completely over lower part of the singlet containing the basketball
Wear a shirt over the singlet and top part of pants containing ball

, An Australian rules football can make a realistic set of breasts. To use the football, tie up the singlet with string or elastic in between the Australian Rules football and the basketball, to secure the Australian Rules football.


If you can’t find a football, use a large-sized bra to stuff with fabric or polyester filler. This can also make very convincing pregnant breasts.

, Watch pregnant women for clues. If you don’t know any, check out some online videos of pregnant women. Depending on how far along they are in their pregnancy, women may have some of the following traits:Walking with shoulders thrown back for balance
Standing with hands pressed to the lower back (because of lower back pain)
Hands often resting on the top of the belly
Difficulty getting in and out of chairs, couches
Swollen and painful feet and ankles

, Pregnancy affects women's mental and emotional states, and this will be key to your portrayal. For some women, pregnancy is a nine month-long emotional high leading to the birth of a baby. For others, hormonal changes can make small problems seem huge, anything sentimental worth crying about, and just exaggerate emotions in general. Consider your role and whether pregnancy and its mental and emotional challenges might be an integral part of the character.

, Get other people to watch you and offer suggestions. If the part calls for specific physical gestures that might be difficult or different for pregnant women, practice those parts with more frequency and consider videotaping yourself to critique your performance.

, You need to get used to the way it feels and how it physically changes you. As rehearsals continue, you need to become more and more comfortable with it. The others actors need to work on their own reactions to it and its physical presence on your body can help."

Position your lips.,
Position your fingers.,
Position your tongue.,
Make final adjustments.,
Blow out of your mouth.,
Listen for the sounds as you practice.",How to Wolf Whistle1," Wet your lips, open your mouth slightly, and pull your lips back over your teeth until your teeth are completely covered. Your lips should be tucked entirely into your mouth, so that only the outer edges of your lips visible.


You may need to move your lips around when you begin to practice the whistle, but for now, keep them wet and tucked inside your mouth.;
, The role of your fingers is to keep your lips in place over your teeth. Hold your hands up with your palms facing you. Hold your index and middle fingers close together in front of you, with your thumbs holding down your ring and pinky fingers. Press the sides of your middle fingers together to make an ""A"" shape.You can also use your pinkies. Hold your hands the same way, holding up your pinkies instead of your index and middle fingers.You can also use one hand. Hold one hand up, and make the okay sign by pressing the tip of your index finger and thumb together. Then separate your fingers slightly, leaving a small space between your fingers for the air to escape. Keep your other fingers out straight., The whistle sound is produced by air flowing over a bevel, or a sharply angled edge. In this case, the sound is created by the upper teeth and tongue directing air onto the lower lip and teeth. To make this sound, you need to position your tongue correctly in your mouth.


Curl your tongue toward the back of your mouth. Using your fingers, fold the tip of your tongue back onto itself. The back of your tongue should cover a wide portion of your lower back teeth., Your lips should still be wet and cover your teeth. Keep your fingers about a knuckle into your mouth, still holding your tongue in place, which should be folded back on itself. Close your mouth enough to make a tight seal around the top, bottom, and outer edges of your fingers., Now that your lips, fingers, and tongue are in position, you need to start blowing out air so you can finally whistle. Inhale deeply and then exhale, pushing the air out of your mouth over the top of your tongue and lower lip. If air is coming out of the sides of your mouth you need to make a tighter seal with your lips on your fingers.


Don’t blow too hard at first.
As you blow, adjust your fingers, tongue and jaws to find the bevel’s sweet spot. This is the area of maximum efficiency for your whistle, where the air is blown directly over the sharpest part of the bevel.

, Your mouth will start to focus the air onto the bevel’s sweet spot with increasing accuracy as you practice. Once you locate the sweet spot, your whistle will have a strong, clear tone, as opposed to a breathy, low-volume sound.


Make sure you don't breath too fast or too often while you are practicing. You don't want to hyperventilate. If you take your time, you will have more breath to practice with.
Using your fingers to apply some extra downward and outward pressure onto the lips and teeth may also be helpful. Experiment with the position of the fingers, tongue, and jaw."
"
Draw back your bottom lip.,
Position your tongue.,
Blow air out of your mouth.,
Adjust your tongue and jaw to find the sweet spot.",How to Wolf Whistle2," The fingerless wolf whistle is achieved through lip and tongue placement. Push your lower jaw forward slightly. Pull your bottom lip up over your teeth. Your bottom teeth should not be visible, but your upper teeth can be.


Your bottom lip should be snug against your lower teeth; if you need help with this movement, press your index and middle fingertip on either side of the mouth to draw your lip slightly out at the corners and over your lips., Draw back your tongue so that it is even with your lower front teeth and flat against the bottom of your mouth. This action also broadens and flattens the front edge of the tongue, yet there is still a space between the tongue and the lower front teeth. The sound of the whistle comes from air that is blown over the bevel, or a sharply angled edge, you create with your tongue and lips.As an alternative, flatten out your tongue so that the sides of your tongue are pressed against the edges of your back teeth. Roll the tip of your tongue down slightly, making a ""U"" shaped dip in the middle where air can pass out from behind your tongue., Using your upper lip and teeth, direct the air downwards and towards your lower teeth. The focus of the air is crucial for this technique. You should be able to feel the air on the underside of your tongue. And if your hold your finger below your lower lip, you should feel the downward thrust of air when you exhale., Your whistle may start out sounding breathy in a lower-volume that fades in and out, but don't worry. You just need to find the area of maximum efficiency, where the air is blown directly over the sharpest part of the bevel you've made in your mouth. Keep practicing to increase the volume of your whistle.Make sure you don't breath too much or too fast while you practice. You don't want to hyperventilate. If you take your time, you will have more breath to practice with."

, The script is what your actors and crew will follow to know what they say/do and what the episode is all about. Before writing your script you should create notes about characters, storylines and ideas - this should be the bible to follow when writing. You cannot have a show without a script - or series bible.

, If you want to produce it yourself, then you will need actors, film, sound and directors. If you want a company to produce it for you then send the script into them, along with a short pitch (a page or so on what the show is about). You have more chance if you send the script into a company that produces similar shows. Or you can just send the script to everyone.

, They will guide you on the amount of money to sell your idea for and will make sure the company is treating you fairly.

, The pilot episode is the first episode in your series. The events that happen in the pilot are what the show should be based around. Normally, after the pilot, the audience is asked what they think about it. If they like it, more episodes will be commissioned - if not, then the end is near.

, Once you have everything you need, and the audience approves, you can start filming your show. You can film in a closed studio or get the audience in to watch (this normally happens with sitcom).

Understand exactly what fire breathing is.,
Note the details of fire breathing.,
Know the different types of fire breathing.,
Know the dangers.,
Understand your limits.",How to Understand Fire Breathing," Fire breathing is when a fire breather takes a mouthful of fuel and spits out a mist of fuel and air onto a flame. There are many factors to consider The angle from your chest, for instance, is crucial- too low, and you can burn your clothes. Too high, and burning gas is in your face. The trick is getting it just right to produce a steady, quick flame that shoots away from your body and not on it.;
, When you watch a fire breathing routine, you will usually see a very precise order of events take place:

The fire breather, off to the side. Fuels used are kept secret to avoid amateurs hurting themselves. For more information on what fuels to use, set up an in person lesson with a professional fire breather. Do NOT attempt this on our own.






He/she holds a pre-lit torch mere feet from the face. This torch is made of a rod with Kevlar or Cotton wicking, soaked in the appropriate fuel. Most use a metal rod with a fuel-soaked wick end for the right burn. Note that, whatever they use, it is normally not flammable,






The fire breather positions the angle to avoid getting burnt or burning others.






They spit. It's not a very precise term, but that is what happens. Using about the same lip set as when playing a trumpet, the fire breather spits out fuel in a fine mist, trying to get the fuel to go out as far as possible. Too heavy of a stream and the fuel will not go out far enough, and blowback will happen almost every time.
The fuel ignites. The fire breather will try to keep the flame going as long as possible unless the technique calls for something different. The breather must ensure that no fuel remains in their mouth, since all fuels are poison to some degree.

, There are many ways to breathe fire. If you watch a fire breather's act, you will notice a few different kinds, but probably not all. A short list of techniques is below, but, please note that these are only a few of the many unique techniques used by fire breathers. Techniques vary from person to person.
Forty-five degree fire blast. This is the basic technique- the breather holds their head at a good, basic angle from their body, and spits out fuel into the torch flame held a couple of feet from their face.






Campfire. This is when the fire breather angles the head downwards, sending the blast to the ground. This should only be attempted when the ground is a non-flammable surface.






Hell fire. This is done when the fire breather squats down on the ground, the flame angled down. As flames rise, the breather starts to stand, giving the appearance he/she is coming up from the pits of hell, with flames all around. As flames are all over the breather, a non-flammable outfit covers the whole body.






Repeating blasts. Three or more quick, choppy bursts of flame without getting more fuel. This creates a ""fireball"" like effect, and is good for shock effect.






The Circus Tent. This is a group trick- four or more stand in a circle, a good distance from each other, and breathe fire at a forty five degree angle upwards. If done correctly, the flames meet at a central point, making a tent of flames.






Biggest Blast Ever. Two regular forty-five degree blasts are done, making a very large flame above the fire breathers' heads.






The Dragon. This is where the breather will ignite the flame at a 45 degree angle, after doing so the breather will remove their torch and continue to breathe out for 2-4 seconds so they appear to be breathing fire like a dragon.






Twin Trails. In this move the breather will use their free hand to block part of the fuel spray to create two separate breaths next to each other







, Fire breathers have many things to watch out for- many not surfacing until years after their act has ended. A brief list of the dangers and explanations are shown below.


Blowback. The flame, in a way, blows back at the fire breather, following the trail of fuel to the fire breather's mouth and burning their face.
Wind changes. The slightest breeze can have flames whip around into the opposite direction, spewing onto the body, possibly causing serious burns/death. Even smaller breezes can maim/kill bystanders, since they are normally off to one side, it only takes a slight angle change to burn them.
Hydrocarbon pneumonitis, also called ""fire eaters pneumonia"" or ""chemical pneumonia"", this is caused by the fire breather inhaling fuel over long periods of time.
Other health issues, including, but not limited to, skin irritation, dry mouth, gum diseases, stomach ulcers, poisoning, acute respiratory distress, and even cancers, since many fuels contain carcinogens.
Effects from the fuels, such as overly-volatile fuel, poisonous gasses, and even drunkenness when working with ethyl alcohol.
Asbestos poisoning. Surprisingly enough, many wicks contain asbestos. While banned in many countries, it still surfaces every so often among fire breathers, causing serious damage to the lungs.
Legal problems. People going around breathing huge flames around other people are going to have conflicts with the law. If bystanders are harmed or if fires are set, the fire breather is often sued for reckless endangerment or arson.

, If this sounds like fun to you despite the dangers, find a professional and take lessons. Do not even consider a wadded up newspaper and mouthful of gasoline. It's dangerous, deadly and reckless to others. It's incredibly ignorant to do, and consider if it's worth a burned face for life. Fire breathing is the most dangerous of the fire arts, and even many professional fire handlers refrain from doing it.

Read the play and understand it.,
Walk around a room while you are saying the lines out loud.,
Know your cues.,
Perform your parts of the play while you are learning your lines.,

Don't be overwhelmed at the amount of lines you need to learn.,
Have fun.,
Take breaks.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Say the lines to yourself during your daily routine.,
Use a friend to help you.,
Make a schedule with the rest of the cast to practice.",How to Learn Lines for a Play," You need to know what's happening, so that you understand why your character is saying what you are saying. Do you have trouble with your character? Can you not read the lines clearly? Ask a friend for help.


Get into character. If you don't know what that means, it means to be the person/creature you're playing, walk, talk, look, like the part you're playing; then, you will make it more realistic.;
, You should practice doing it as it would be done in real life, on stage or in a studio. In the performance it won't be done in your head.


Ask a family member or a friend to help you learn them, reading along with what you are saying and to catch skipped or wrong emphasis on words.

, If you know your lines -- but you don't know when to say them -- you're going to struggle. Know the last bit of the previous person's lines or the events leading to yours; so that you know when to say your lines.

, It will make it more realistic, and it will also help you with your performance skills.

, Take a few lines at a time. One time you can look at one scene, and then split the scene up into groups of lines. Learn a few lines at a time and keep going over them -- even if you know them. Going over them again will make you feel confident.

, If you see a big speech, split that into smaller parts and you will be able to learn it. It might be really cool if you have a lot of lines, just make sure you learn them all, to do them with real feeling.

, Acting is work, but it can also be a lot of fun. If you enjoy doing it, you will be able to excel in it a lot easier. You will be able to learn the lines easier if you are enjoying it, otherwise, you will be bored and not able to concentrate on it for long.

, It is very important that you take a breaks, preferably after a set amount of time. The amount of time you can work before having a break will vary with the individual, but it doesn't matter whether other people can work longer than you. Everyone is different!

, Always have a drink of water with you. It will really help you concentrate if you have a drink of water. Also, it may help if you have sweets or candy with you. If you get stressed, then stop for a minute, have some sweets and continue.

, When you are walking or driving somewhere you have to go to anyway, practice some lines. Incorporate the practice in your daily routine. Practice in front of the mirror. Look at yourself. Find out which expression works best with your character. Have your lines close to be able to quickly glance over them for help.

, This step should be practiced at least five weeks before the performance. Have your friend or friends read certain parts as you try to remember you lines to respond. Don't use your playbook for this step.

, Use wardrobe and put makeup on for this step.

Start out by experimenting singing different genres of music. This will help you figure out what kind of singing style comes naturally to you. Take note of things you learn about yourself as a singer, for example: your vocal range, singing styles that are easier and more difficult to pull off, and what wears out your voice.


You also need to figure out what kind of performing works best for you; do you work better singing solo, as a lead singer, or as a backup singer? Do you prefer performing in front of small, intimate crowds, or louder, more rambunctious crowds? Figuring out the answers to these questions can further develop your act, image, and set of skills as a singer. Some other questions you might want to address about yourself are:

How good is your ear for music? This means: are you able to sing in tune? Can you recognize and feel rhythm in songs? Can you hear a melody once and sing it back correctly?;
, You want to learn how to bring out the best in your voice. Hiring a vocal coach can help you reach your greatest potential. Vocal coaches can remedy poor technique while addressing your strong and weak areas as a singer.With a voice coach, you can practice increasing your range as well as experimenting with your vocal dexterity in front of someone who can offer valuable feedback. This practice and guidance will ultimately help build up your confidence in your singing abilities.If you can’t find a vocal coach that you feel comfortable with, consider taking online signing classes.Although online classes don’t provide a person to person learning experience, they can introduce you to foundational singing techniques.
Just be wary of online webpages that advertise themselves as singing review sites. These sites are usually scams and peddle products to unsuspecting customers. You should be very suspicious of sites like these., In the music industry, if you want to be considered a professional, you need to be ready to sing whatever someone puts in front of you. This could mean singing off a piece of sheet music. If this happens, you are going to be expected to read and follow along effortlessly.


Prepare yourself now, so you can be ready to go when the time comes.

, Learn to play the piano or guitar so you can be a multi-faceted artist, and perform more independently. Learning an instrument also helps you play underlying notes in songs, which can give your performance a unique addition. It's also a plus to learn an instrument so you only have to depend on yourself to perform, lowering your risk of having last minute performance issues, like your guitarist not showing up.


All in all, figure out the materials you need to pull off a live performance. This will solidify your presence on stage, help create your image, establish your individual sound, and draw in your unique audience following.

, Analyze performances of some of your favorite singers. Look up videos of live performances, and take note of their stage presence. How do they connect with their audience? It may be helpful to watch these performances on mute, so you can concentrate on their movements and expressions.These might be characteristics you want to emulate in your performances.


It could also be helpful to research your favorite singers and musicians and see how they got to where they are today. What training did they do before they made it big? Who influenced their decision to follow their dream? What obstacles did they face, and how did they conquer them?
Doing some research can provide you with background knowledge about how other people in your position have found success in your anticipated field.

, Performing often will increase your confidence in front of a mic, and expose you to various audience settings. You can start out small with joining church choirs or acapella troupes, singing at bars and nightclubs, or simply performing at karaoke night.


Starting out with small performances is a good place to begin before moving onto bigger gigs, but there are other ways that you can perform too.

, Use the college directory to contact the events department, and see if you can perform at gathering on campus. For example, colleges often look for singers to perform the National Anthem at their varsity sports games., Some artists and songwriters in your area might need singers to sing backup on their demo. Ask around and reach out to these artist and ask if they looking for any extra singers. If they need an example of how you sing, send them your demo or set up a time and place where you can perform a song for them.


If someone agrees to let you sing on their demo, see if they will allow you to use their song (which you sang backup on) as a project for your personal portfolio., Audition a lot so you can get comfortable performing on the spot and preparing your quick pitch to producers and managers. It might even be a good idea to audition for theatre groups and singing troupes.That way, you can get experience working and performing on stage as well as getting into a network of performers.

, Having a demo of your work on you at all times is a good way to put yourself and your talents out there whenever an opportunity arises. At any performance you do, you can sell your demo CD to interested audience members, or give it away for free.You want your demo to include a manageable amount of songs, perhaps between 4 and 10.This means you want your demo to have enough songs to showcase the range of your talents, but also give your listener a small and convenient amount of music to listen to quickly.
If you can’t record your demo in a professional studio, you can easily get the required materials to do it yourself. All you need to do purchase some music to sing over and record yourself., Get involved with the music events happening in your area. By attending musical events and making friends with other singers and musicians near you, you surround yourself with like-minded people who can support your musical efforts. You can also learn about new possible places to perform, and gain some insight and advice from fellow performers.The more you surround yourself with people who are in your field, the more exposure and opportunities you'll find to show off your talent and get recognized.

, Investigate and get in touch with booking agents in your area. Inquire if you can open for any upcoming musical acts.Being an opening act for a larger performer is a good way to gain experience and make connections.


Eventually, your gigs could become bigger and bigger, leading to more opportunities of a producer or agent hearing your sound.

, Publicizing your upcoming performances is a good way to get your name out there in your local community. Eventually (hopefully), you will be recognized by your work around your area.


Publicity in your local papers can build up a sizable reputation before your career moves you somewhere bigger like New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago.Be sure to save positive reviews and articles from publications so you can include those reviews on your personal website and quote them in interviews., Send your demo to record labels, talent agencies, music managers, and A&R consultants (artist and repertoire consultants). Many of these contacts can be found online, you just need to do some searching.


Usually, smaller record labels are more open to receiving a variety of musical material. Don’t limit yourself to only sending your music to big record labels. You might have a better chance of getting your foot in the door by sending your demo to all kinds of record labels.
Try to make good impressions on everyone you meet. It doesn’t matter if it’s the secretary at an agency you visit to meet a manager, or a fellow musician you have played with; a lot of music professionals get noticed by word of mouth recommendations by other professionals. Gaining a good reputation as dedicated, and a pleasant musician to work with can get you far.

, Press kits provide your audience (usually managers, agents, producers – people you are trying to convince to hire you) a small promotional taste of who you are as an artist. It lets your image and musical vibe shine through to potential employers in a quick, convenient, and tangible way. Normally, press kits are prepared very strategically to grab the attention of whomever it’s getting sent to.


Because of this aspect, consider having a professional help you with developing your press kit.
Don’t forget to include a link to your portfolio or personal website.

, A website is an extremely accessible medium to make you music available to nearly anyone on the internet. Having a personal website allows you to construct a varied online portfolio that can be shared and sent easily as a link. To top it off, most personal websites are free, so it is a really economical way to market yourself and your music.


Be sure to include information about your background as a singer, contact information, positive reviews, and samples of your work (your demo).

, Having a YouTube channel is a great way to share your performance footage, but you need to be on all social media sites to fully promote your work in the most efficient way. Being connecting and promoting yourself on all social networks instantly broadens your audience base. A widespread fan base that it connected to you on multiple social sites can boost your credibility and popularity as a performer (even if you are still an independent and without a manager). By establishing a wide, loyal following early on, managers will eventually seek you out and want to manage you. Consider creating these social media accounts to spread your talents:


Twitter
Facebook
Myspace music
Soundcloud
Tumblr
Instagram

, Having an agent could greatly increase the work you receive as a singer. However, getting an agent to take you on as a client can be very challenging.


If you show drive, commitment, and confidence in yourself and your work, you may win over a reputable and bustling agent.

, Read and go over your contract with a fine tooth comb. Pay special attention to things like fees, commission, the duration of your contract, and the restrictions on your performance exclusivity.


Always voice your concerns and ask questions if you are ever confused about any aspect in the contract. If you don’t like something in the contract, try to negotiate and find common ground. This shows that you are responsible and passionate about making a good deal and coming to a mutual agreement.
Only sign the contract when you are completely satisfied with the features arranged.

, Audition for singing competitions near and far. Talent shows and local competitions are a great place to begin, but eventually move on to bigger competitions like American Idol, The Voice, America’s Got Talent, and the X-Factor.


The directions to enter these big competitions can be found on their websites. You can send in your audition tape, and go there in person and perform a live audition., These are sites that don't initially involve record companies at all. They offer artists an independent outlet to getting their music out to the public.



TuneCore.com allows you to publish your song or album on their website for a price, but then you get to keep all the rights and royalties to the music you distributed.This is an easy way to bypass problems that musicians often have with dealing with record labels. You have to put in some promotional effort, but once your material gets noticed, it could serve as a good springboard to starting your singing career.

WeeklyIndie.com allows musicians to upload their music, and then the best 10 songs of the week get sent to the website’s paying subscribers. This is a really competitive website, but if your music is chosen, it could launch your singing career into something bigger and better."

Learn to control your breathing.,
Take deep breaths.,
Feel yourself inhale and exhale.,
Watch yourself in a mirror to check your breaths.,
Stagger your breaths.,
Practice good posture.",How to Sing and Dance at the Same Time1," The most important skill to master in singing and dancing at the same time is becoming a pro at controlled breathing. You want to be able to have a sustained and smooth exhale for long notes and slow phrases. The goal is to learn how to breathe from your diaphragm, which means you will learn to breathe more deeply to avoid airy singing. Here is an exercise to try:Hold a feather in front of your mouth as you breathe so that you move the feather. You want a steady stream of breathe that is long and controlled.
Continue blowing the feather. Be aware of your body as you exhale, and keep your chest from collapsing.
Do not inhale until you are completely out of air and feel the immediate urge for more air. Keep practicing this exercise, each time trying to blow the feather for longer periods of time.;
, Singing and dancing both require a lot of air, and you need to learn how to breathe from your lower back and belly to achieve a roundness in your breathing. If you take shallow breaths from your chest, you will not sound as good.For deeper breaths, try plank exercises by laying on your front side, and lifting your legs and shoulders up off the ground. As you do this, take slow, deep breaths. This will strengthen your breathing.Yoga classes are a great way to learn to breathe deeply and strengthen your muscles., Inhaling is when breath enters your lungs, and exhaling is when breath leaves. You have to learn how to exhale and inhale quickly and deeply because the music will not wait for you to catch up. Before strengthening your breathing technique, it is important for you to feel your breaths, and be aware of what your body is doing when you take deep breaths. Here are some exercises to help you become more in-tuned:Visualize the air weighing 50 pounds as you take a deep breath, and imagine the air falling low into your body. Think about it slowly falling below your belly button, and really focus on the sensation. Then, slowly exhale.
Inhale again, but a little faster. Continue to imagine the air being heavy and falling deeply, but allow yourself to visualize it faster than before. You should feel your abdomen and lower back expand as you take in air. Then, exhale the air a little faster than before.

, If you have doubts about how deeply you are breathing, you may find your answer by watching how your external body changes while you are breathing. If you are taking deep breaths, you should see your diaphragm release, and your gut expand. If your body is not changing on the outside, you are not taking deep enough breaths.During breathing exercises, rest one hand on your chest and the other hand on your abdomen. Use one hand to make sure your chest is steady as you breath, and the other to feel your abdomen expand and release. This will help you to feel if you are breathing deeply enough.

, With certain dance routines that are high energy and extra challenging, you may need to stagger your breaths to make it through the song. This means that you need to take short breaths at strategic places during the song.


While practicing the song with the dance, plan out when you will take your breaths by finding breaks in the music. By planning out your breathing, you can more easily make it through the song without running short of air.
If you know a long note in the song is coming up, make sure you find a place in the dance where you can pause, and take a long, deep breath.

, Efficient breathing is more than just learning to exhale and inhale. Your posture needs to work with your breathing in order to improve your singing and make taking a deep, full breath easier. If you allow your body to slouch over, your diaphragm will lock and keep you from taking proper breaths for singing. Always keep your shoulders back, and stand straight to allow your chest and ribs to expand for deep breaths."

Practice singing and dancing together.,
Match your singing to the moves.,
Start a rigorous fitness regime to increase stamina.",How to Sing and Dance at the Same Time2," Most things are hard at first, and they require hard work to master. Do not try mastering singing and dancing separately before you bring them together. You should be practicing for what you ultimately want to achieve, which is singing and dancing at the same time.


Practice three to five days a week for two hours at a time. Your two hour workout should include about twenty minutes of stretching and vocal warm-ups. Just remember, the more you practice, the better you will get.Practice singing and dancing together until you feel you could do it in your sleep, and then keep practicing.
Get the choreography into your muscle memory. You should practice the dance so much that you do not even have to think about the moves as you are dancing and singing. You want your muscle memory to kick-in so you can effortlessly perform the moves.

, As you are learning the choreography, simply say the lyrics of the song as you move. This will allow you to see how the music and moves fit together. Usually, certain dance movements are catered to fit certain musical phrases to help you make connections to the vocals. Notice these parts to help guide you through the song and dance.Try singing while simply walking around a room, or doing chores.This will help your body become used to spacial awareness when you are singing., Singing and dancing simultaneously requires lungs that are at their best fitness. In order to achieve optimal lung capacity, you have to train your lungs through high-level cardio workouts at least three times a week.Whether you run, jog, ride a bike, or swim, do something that increases your heart rate. Try to make each workout last at least one hour long."
"
Record yourself.,
Get feedback from another person.,
Increase the difficulty of the songs and dances as you practice.",How to Sing and Dance at the Same Time3," One of the best ways to analyze your voice, and check your progress, is to listen to recordings of yourself singing while dancing. You can focus on your voice, and compare your recordings as you go. Critiquing yourself will allow you to pinpoint where you need to improve so you can get better., It can be hard to critique your own singing or dancing when you are performing. It may be helpful to find someone willing to watch you practice so that they can provide you with helpful feedback or advice. Ideally, you will want to find a vocal coach or someone who is trained in singing and dancing, but if you don't know a professional, ask a friend or family member for their input., Once you master beginner songs and dances, or any song and dance you have been working on, challenge yourself with something more difficult. Once you see yourself completing song and dance numbers that are more difficult, you can feel confident that you are becoming better.

Think of a concept for your show.,
Decide on the length of the event.,
Select a performance venue.,
Cast your show.,
Create a budget!,
Once you’ve worked out if you can afford to produce your dream then book the venue, book the performers, and start promoting!",How to Produce Your First Burlesque Show," If you’re in a town where there are a lot of burlesque shows, then you will want to think of how your show can be different from the rest of the pack. A themed burlesque show or a variety show, are the two most frequently developed types of shows. New York’s current themed Burlesque shows include: Cosplay Burlesque (a burlesque show that included performers dressing up as various anime characters), D20 Burlesque (a monthly burlesque show that uses board games as the theme), David Lynch Burlesque (David Lynch films are the theme of this monthly burlesque show), Hyper gender Burlesque (Summer, 1,001 Arabian Nights, Cornucopia, and Freedom have all been the subject of this unique monthly burlesque show where both theme and cast change monthly). Nothing is off limits in terms of themes: Storybook Burlesque and Book Club Burlesque both use books as their subject matter.


The concept of a variety show is no longer a novelty in itself, with more and more burlesque performers studying skills like fire eating, glass walking, sword swallowing, and contortion these performers instantly add a touch of variety to any show they are booked in. Many producers will also hire magicians, comedians, or drag artist who can double as host and performer. Spice! an evening of variety recently returned to the New York nightlife scene with a complete redesign. Producers opted to scrap the original format of burlesque, sideshow, comedy for a historical theme, in which all acts are connected by a story line. Scripted shows involve group rehearsals, which in itself create an added cost for a production. For your first production it is best to start small (including budget size), but whatever the concept of your show, make it something you love.;
, Is this a one hour show with intermission? Is it an all night 4 hour affair? Look around at other burlesque shows and see what the popular production length is. If most shows in your town are only one hour, then that could be because other producers have already figured out that audiences are only willing to commit an hour to burlesque entertainment. That doesn’t mean your show has to be an hour. You may decide you want to be the producer offering what is not currently available in your town, and then proceed in producing a 2 hour or 4 hour event.

, Unless you own a bar or theater, you’ll need a place to put on the show. Start your search by looking at venues that already house burlesque events. If you see multiple burlesque shows at the same venue, then there’s a good chance the venue has a following for the burlesque scene and that other producers will be happy to know you are looking to bring something to the same venue. If all the shows seem to be from just one producer, you may want to contact that producer to find out they’re experience with the venue. This is not mandatory. Unless that producer owns the venue, you can proceed with contacting the venue and asking for a performance date. Being a bit old fashioned, I think it’s always fun to meet your neighbor. They may be able to help you with something down the road and if they become competition it’s good to know who you are competing against. Remember step 2. Guess what? Where your show will be may influence how long the show will be. If the bar only books acts that are 1 hour, then if you want to use that bar you will have to offer them a 1 hour show. Why do I suggest picking show length before venue? Because if you are truly set on that 4 hour event, then you’ll know what venues to pass up while you are searching for the best performance spot.

, Okay, so you know what kind of show your will do, how long it will be, and where you will do it, unless you are doing a solo (if so then skip to step 5), you’ll need other performers. Do you have friends that are also looking for more stage time and would be interested in your theme? If not, put the word out to other performers asking them to join your show. 10 performers in 1 hour is probably too many.


To figure out how many performers are needed you’ll want to look at: the average length of the routine + the amount of time necessary for setup/ clean up= X then... X divided by,(the length of the show – intermission)= approximate number of acts.
So for example if I have a 1 hour show and I want each routine to be between 3-5 minutes, and I figure some people will leave lots of clothes on stage and some will have lots of set up, then I’m adding an extra 5 minutes for setup/cleanup. 5 minutes + 5 minutes= 10 minutes, then 10 minutes / (60 minutes- 10 minute intermission) = 5 acts needed. I know that I will want to book at least 5 acts to fill my 1 hour show, if I decide to perform as well, then I might only need 4 more performers to fill up the evening or I might add myself as a 6th performer. This way, if most of the routines are closer to 3 minutes with zero cleanup, at least I don’t have to worry about the show wrapping up too early.

, You have the ideal show, the ideal venue, and you are about ready to find the ideal cast. Before you start booking know what kind of money you do or don’t have. Is the venue charging you for space (room rental fee, portion of ticket sales, bar guarantee), if they are, then you’ll want to think about how you plan on covering that cost. Next think about who is doing sound, who is hosting, and who is doing setup/ cleanup (the stage kitten). Do you know someone who can do at least one of those things for free? Do you want to guarantee that the dancers make money? If so, how much? If you are already over budget, maybe think about bringing in fewer performers but asking them to bring 2 routines.


If you hire 2 performers other than yourself, then you still have 6 acts (2 performers + 1 you, multiplied by 2 acts each), but for a lot less money.
Now add up the money you need to cover all expenses and divide that be half the available seats in the venue or average audience size. The more you produce the more you will work with “average audience size” in your budgets. For now you can just look around at shows you’ve been to in your town. In New York, there are so many shows every day of the week, that 20 is not an unreasonable average audience size.
So if you have a room rental fee of $200 for 1 hour. That's Space $200 + $0 for your boyfriend the DJ + $0 for the stage kitten who is new to burlesque and is doing me a favor + $25 for your friend the comedian who will host + $75 guarantee for the 3 dancers including you = $300 for your show, not including marketing cost.
Then $300/ 20= $15 ticket price per person.
Once you know the minimum you need to make, adjust your ticket price according to what local shows cost and what your customer would be comfortable paying. If the other burlesque shows in you area charge $5 you will not be able to easily sell tickets for $15 unless you can show you are providing something that is worth the extra cost.

, You’ll want to use as many sources of free marketing and advertising that’s available to you. Maybe a friend can design a postcard. Submitting the event to your local newspaper is free. Creating a Facebook event page is free. Emailing all your friends is also free. If your budget allows you’ll want to make money available for postcard or flyer printing, and the occasional paid ad, but remember to keep things simple for your first show. If you like producing, then it won’t be long before you’ll be creating bigger budgets and rhinestone filled dreams.

Figure out what kind of record you want to break.,
To get your record in the book you have to visit their website at www.guinnessworldrecords.com.,
If they like the record you want to break they will email you the guidelines and rules to beat this record.,
If it is a feat you want to accomplish, then practice whenever you can on it, even if you're already super good at it.

,
When you want to attempt the record you will need at least two people watching you.,
Send the video footage, photos, signed witness statements, and everything they've requested in the guidelines in the mail.

,
After even more waiting, if you've beaten the world record you will get your very own Guinness World Record certificate!",How to Get Into the Guinness Book of World Records," Some records are easier to break than others. Do you have an unusual type of body? Are you particularly good at a certain talent? Even your huge collection of comics could be a record breaker! Records in the GWR (Guinness Book of World Records) book have been beaten tons of times. Look in the book and see if there's a record you think you could beat.;
, They have an ""APPLY NOW"" section where you can write what type of record you are interested in. You will probably have to wait a very long time until you get a reply (it could be longer than three months). Remember, there are hundreds of people just like you who want to break a record.

, Make sure you read through them carefully.

,, Get a camera or video camera and film the entire thing. Whatever this thing may be. But don't let the witnesses leave right after that! You'll need them to sign witness statements.

,, And if your record was impressive and cool enough, then they'll put it in the Guinness book of world records!

You need to be of a good standard.,
Get enrolled in a stage school.,
Have an agent.,
Don't lie about work because they ask for people who can confirm and they will pick out a scam.,
When you get an audition, do try your best.,
Remember that not all parts are the leading role.,
If you get to the West End, feel free to be nervous.,
And finally, enjoy it!",How to Make It on the West End," Directors don't want people who can't do what is needed for the production. If you want to be noticed you have to be good. It's a sad and simple truth. Practicing will make you improve.


Take singing instructions. Most people, mainly young singers, get taught to sing and taught technique that is so helpful.
Dancing is a required skill. Stage schools will improve this. It doesn't have to be ballet! Many schools offer modern, street tap and other dancing styles!
Acting is obviously a key thing. Acting isn't about being able to show off or brag. Most acting is about being realistic. And musical theatre although may in some productions be more wild doesn't mean it has to be so strange it's unbelievable. Realistic acting uses eyes and facial expressions much more to show emotions.
Body language is used also to show who your character is! You need to be the character! If people can tell you're acting then that's not good enough! If somebody watching you starts to believe your character; for example, when on a soap opera somebody is poisoning somebody else, you as an audience think: ""I hate her!"" then that's good because you believe that she would kill somebody and this shows that they are a good actor! Remember, soap operas do not usually translate into West End shows.;
, This will help you get auditions if you are good enough.

, It's your agent's job is to get you auditions. You need them. You can't make it without one so if you can't get one, then you are wasting your time. You will need a professional photographer to take head shots. Amateur shots will seem unprofessional. Think of how the director will see you compared to other people auditioning. He sees a badly taken photo that looks edited of a girl, he sees the next photo; a flattering yet truthful photo of a person. Photographers are paid to do this. They know what they are doing. If you aren't willing to spend money on a photographer then this isn't the job for you. Acting is hard work so get used to it or don't do it. This isn't celebrity stuff. So, you will need a portfolio that includes clear head shots along with a CV or Resume to show any past work/ experience you've done.

, Get involved and don't ever assume you are the best actor or whatever out there. You won't be working all the time - 90% of actors are unemployed.


If or when you get invited to an audition, say yes. Even if you don't like the sound of it, still go along.This is because your principal will then know you are willing for anything.

, Even if it's a triple threat audition and you're rubbish at singing, etc if you have potential elsewhere, you are likely to get it if you are very good, or perhaps noticed. You may not be 'Christine' for 'Phantom Of The Opera' but perhaps you would make a good 'Nancy' for 'Oliver'?

, You don't get offered the leading role unless you have worked your butt off and shown that you are good enough to learn the lines and dance. There aren't many leading roles but if, for example, you become an extra but prove yourself to be very talented and a good actor/ actress, they might make you an understudy of a main part, so it's not like an overnight thing where you wake up and you suddenly have a leading role.


You need to react to actors well and be a good people person, get yourself in there and get noticed and make friends in the right places. A good word may make a difference.

, Even if it's the part of an extra, everyone gets nervous. If you suffer from stage fright, imagine everyone has a hole in their sock. That's what Winston Churchill did to stop him being nervous whilst making speeches.

Begin looking for local auditions and go to them.,
Ask for feedback often.,
Find a play that interests you, audition and do your best.,
Start taking meetings.,
Don't give up, be persistent.",How to Get an Acting Job with No Experience," Becoming familiar with script formats will give you fluency during the audition process. You should be able to memorize a script selection rather quickly and with a high level of accuracy. This skill forms the foundation for your craft.;
, In order to embody your character, you must have experience connecting with different human qualities and flaws. Do exercises where you read for roles outside your comfort zone or type. This will help to expand your range and provide variety to your repertoire.

, Performing in front of others is a skill in itself. Stay sharp and loose with your skills by taking acting classes in your community. Practicing scenes with other people will help you out tremendously.

, Find people who are able to give you honest feedback and ask them questions to help you improve.

, Check your local newspaper or online resources to see what is out there. Any sort of audition is excellent practice, in just the same way that career seekers attend many interviews to perfect their interviewing skills. It's a learning process, owning your skills of not only acting well on demand but also interacting positively with those auditioning so as to leave them with a favorable impression.

, Ask acting coaches, friends, casting directors for advice, though remember not to take it too personally. Realize what is true about the things they tell you and improve your skills as a result.

, It is not about getting the part (though that would be great). It's about gaining the real time experience of the actor's life. The more experiences you have the better you'll be. Take a risk and audition for a show.


Do not be surprised if offered a lesser role. Take it. Every role is valuable and begins to build up your acting resume.

, Once you've gotten experience auditioning and being in shows, this is the next step. Reach out to anyone you know in the entertainment industry for a meeting. The goal of this meeting is to get your face in front of someone who could help your professional development. The more people who know you and click with you, the more people there are who can help you.


Consider working with an agent. Agents can be great to get you in to auditions. But they are not absolutely necessary to being an actor.

, Don't give up acting just because you don't make it onto your favorite show and/or play. The right part is waiting for you, all you have to do is keep going.

Create the theme of the show.,
Select the characters.,
Develop the script.,
Select the stage.,
Construct your ideal set.,
Record your soundtrack.,
Set the stage.",How to Make a Sesame Place Stage Show," Select a general idea of the theme of your show. Some themes that were done in the past include a spelling bee, rock and roll show, and a beach party.;
, Sesame Place has a wide variety of costumed characters to be used in these shows. It is a good idea to select no more than seven costumed characters for your show. This is because the space in each theater is small and the stage needs to have room for the set, props, and furry characters to dance!


Elmo is a character that you must include in any Sesame Place show. He usually saves the day in the plot and the story revolves around some of his ideas. Elmo is the character that most kids would like to see in the shows.
Big Bird is a giant yellow bird in costume. He is very hard to perform, so it's best not to include him in the story. He can really only perform in the main big theater where Elmo's rock band currently performs because he is too tall and takes up a large amount of space on the stage.
The Count is really only to be used in Halloween specials. Very rarely makes entrances in the park or stage shows.
Zoe is a female character who enjoys ballet. It is important to have at least one girl and one guy in each show to create the fullest diversity.
Human characters are in every show there ever was at Sesame Place. There is typically at most two humans in each show as well as 6-7 costumed characters. Their names must be Jamie, Kay, etc., so any actor could portray them without character limitations.

, Make sure to include a balance of lines between characters with Elmo and the human characters having the most lines. Keep it simple and full of singing. Make sure all jokes or language is appropriate for children under three, but some adult jokes are allowed, such as having Dads dance on stage with Elmo. This is appropriate as it allows the rest of the older audience to enjoy the show. The shows that stay around for a long time are ones that all ages can laugh at and enjoy. If you can get the whole audience to dance and sing, then you have a hit!

, Certain theaters can only hold so many people and are made for smaller shows. If a ton of characters are in it, then Big Bird's theater is the way to go. If your show is not ""fully developed"" or you are going to use a smaller set, then the playground theater is the way to go. Elmo's Theater is mainly used for Elmo's World Live and should only be used for that. So if you have an outdoor show, you probably shouldn't use the indoor stage!

, It's easy to just make changes to the indoor stage to fit Elmo's world live since the main set is there already, but constructing a new set to fit the performance of other shows can be difficult. You need to make sure the set is workable for the characters and allows them to move and dance. Keeping the show set to one is the best way to go because there is no stage crew and you don't want to make it hard for the actors to switch sets. A simple flap to lift for a finale is fine but don't go overboard!

, Once you have all of your voice actors in the recording studio, simply record the script as you wrote it. Wherever there is a human speaking, just leave a short pause in the track instead of recording the human voice. This way multiple humans can play the same part and play it live with a microphone in place versus trying to move their lips to sync to another person's voice.

, Once your show is all set to go, practice your performance after park hours to get the choreography down pat. Now is the time to let the show go on and amuse hundreds of kids from around the world!

Don't be afraid to make the break.",How to Get an Agent," The most important way to get an agent to represent you in the business, be it acting or music, is to get out there and start doing your craft. Agents look for talented and already established artists with a track record they'll be able to profit from, not people who may be talented but who've never done anything in the business. If you want to get an agent for acting, you need to act first. If you want to be a singer, you need to perform.


Go to every open call-out for actors and take whatever work you can get. The experience may not be glamorous, but it's experience that you can use to move up in the world. If you play music, get on every open-mic, local festival, and radio show that will have you and listen to your music. Get your name out there as a reliable worker.;
, Aside from getting as much experience working as you can, you also need to practice and perfect your skills by taking lessons, workshops, or classes related to your craft. Even if you want to be a stand-up comedian, there are craft-centered workshops in which you learn stage-timing and receive feedback from experience joke-tellers. Find a class or workshop in your area and sign up for it.


If you don't enjoy the work itself, there'll be no point in getting an agent to help you get more of it.

, Start building a network of actors or musicians whom you trust and can use for guidance in building a career. You'll be able to use them for craft tips most importantly, but they'll also prove useful when it comes time to meeting agents. If you've got an actor friend who has scored representation from a licensed agency, you might have an ""in"" with that agency if you've worked together and shared resources in the past.


Help out other performers, too. If you hear about an open call-out for actors, tell your actor friends rather than hiding it from them and hoping to keep it a secret so you'll get it for yourself. When a friend wins a part, celebrate. Spreading the wealth around benefits everyone and will make them more willing to help you out if you need it.

, Some successful and famous actors--Bill Murray is a notable example--don't have agents, and choose to do that work on their own. An agent is someone who secures auditions, contacts casting directors, and networks in the industry on your behalf. For them to take you on as a client means that they must believe that eventually you'll make them money.


Generally, an agent-client relationship is based on contracts to be signed, rather than a monthly fee. In other words, your agent will get you a paying gig and retain a certain percentage of the work. If you're difficult to book, an agency will be unwilling to take you on, because they won't make any money from you.
To secure an agent, you must either be exceptionally charming and personable, experienced, or--ideally--a combination of both.

, Brand yourself under your new public persona and start building your presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms. Use these tools to make connections and keep up with friends in the industry, as well as to research agents and agencies.


Use the cocktail party rule of thumb: treat social networking as a professional platform. Never say anything to someone you're hoping to network with professionally that you wouldn't say to them at a cocktail party to their face. Use social networking to market new shows you're acting in or gigs you've booked as well as to congratulate others on their successes., Typically, a press kit will involve headshots, references from other actors or directors you've worked with, and any other press material you may have received, as well as a brief sample of your work. A resume is a formalized list of all your work experience as related to the field. In other words, no need to list your high school fast food jobs on your acting resume.

, Ask other actors to recommend you to their agency and see if you can secure a consultation meeting at some point in the near future. Discuss you desire to secure representation from the agency and your goals for your career.


Be realistic and avoid over-doing it. No one wants a needy and desperate wanna-be star annoying them in their office. If you're a professional, act like it.
Avoid cold calls. Back in the day, you used to send unsolicited headshots to an agency to secure a meeting, but this is largely not the case anymore. You need to either get a recommendation from another representative of the agency, or attend an open call-out or workshop an agency or group of agencies puts on to find talent.

, If you secure a meeting, you may need to audition for your agent just as you would for a part. Prepare a couple of monologues or a scene to perform on the spot in case you need to. You don't want to waste a valuable opportunity by being unprepared.

, Agencies are typically regulated by the state economy and need to kick back a certain percentage (usually 10%) of their income to the state. There are many people claiming to represent talent who lack this and seek to exploit inexperienced actors who don't know their way around the business.


To check the registration of a particular agency in California, visit the Department of Industrial Relations website: http://www.dir.ca.gov/databases/dlselr/talag.html


, Colleges will typically advertise the teacher-to-student ratio, meaning that a good school will supposedly have fewer students per teacher, resulting in more face time and contact. You're looking for the same thing with an agent.


An overworked, overbooked agent from a big agency who decides to take you on might end up being less valuable than a more devoted agent with fewer clients from a smaller agency.

, Your relationship with your agent is a real interpersonal relationship, not just a work relationship. You need to pick someone who you can get along with and openly discuss your plans and ambitions with. An agent you're intimidated by or one who doesn't really believe in your talents won't be the best career choice in the long run.


In your first few meetings, discuss your plans for yourself. Ask the agent what they see in you and where they think you might go. Seeing if your plans match up will be a good way to judge the workability of the relationship.

, If you've got a dysfunctional relationship with an agent who is misrepresenting you or representing you lazily, you need to find a new one. Be patient and don't expect much too soon, but if your agent is purposefully blowing you off or you feel like you're being taken advantage of, make the break.


Many young actors are scared to try for new representation for fear of losing the stability of the old relationship. ""Even if I'm not working,"" says the young actor, ""at least I have an agent."" But an agent who isn't getting you parts might as well not exist. If the relationship isn't working out like you want it to, you have to take the initiative to find a new one.

Embrace ritual.,
Deal with failures right away.,
Recommit yourself after a failure.",How to Perform1," Although some stress can lead to adrenaline and high performance, it is necessary to handle the physical effects of stress, or your body will break down. Make sure you find your individual pressure release valve, so experiment with exercise, social support, meditation or even videos on YouTube.;
, Then, respond to everything you can control. Refusing to waste time on things you can’t control improves mental stability and, thus, performance., Although it may not be very simple to change your way of thinking, try repeating a mantra, like “Take every risk, drop every fear,” “Be positive, patient and persistent” or “Focus on what matters.”, Imagine what it will be like to rise to this challenge and overcome it. If you can see the benefits very clearly, you will find it easier to perform in high-stress situations.

, If you know that you are a sprinter, but you have to run a longer distance, your goal throughout the race should be to stay near the front until you have a chance to sprint ahead. Hone these skills whenever you can.

, Give yourself personal goals if your coach or company isn’t very good at creating incentives. Try smaller goals and larger long-term goals if you meet your checkpoints along the way.

, If you feel confident in a suit or a special pair of shoes, wear them each time you need to perform. Although too much “magical thinking” can lead to superstition, the right amount builds confidence.

, This is the best way to avoid drops in confidence. Build emotional resilience by finding the silver lining or the lesson after every failure.

, Repeat the previous steps to get back into the right frame of mind for your next performance.

Select the right space.,
Improve the acoustics of your studio.,
Purchase your equipment.,
Set up the studio.",How to Set Up a Studio1," When you have the luxury of choosing between two or more potential recording studios, assess each space for the following qualities and choose the room that meets the most standards:


Size. Larger rooms are always preferable to smaller spaces because it allows you to record more musicians and store more equipment.
Noise. Microphones magnify all of the noises around you. Choose a space that set off from streets and neighbors. Avoid rooms with heating vents, plumbing pipes, and windows that may let in the sounds of birds, insects, and the elements. You must also take into consideration that you will produce a significant amount of noise, so be courteous to your neighbors and select a room that is at least semi-removed from common spaces.
Flooring. Carpeting compromises the acoustical integrity of your studio. It absorbs high frequencies, but not low frequencies. Rooms with hard flooring are ideal.
Acoustics. The ideal studio is a large room, with high ceilings and several irregular surfaces for sounds to bounce off.;
, In order to generate a great recording, your studio must be acoustically sound. Consider installing the following acoustic treatments in your studio space:


Bass traps. Bass traps absorb low-end frequencies. Begin by installing one bass trap in each of the corners of your studio.Acoustic Panels. Acoustic panels are placed on studio walls to absorb sound.Between 20% to 80% of the surface area of your studio walls may need to be covered.Reflection Filters. Instead of acoustically treating your entire room, purchase a reflection filer, or a mini vocal booth., To adequately equip your recording studio, you don’t need to purchase every instrument or gadget on the market. Instead, invest in the following essential:


Computer
DAW/Audio Interface Combo. This contains the software you will need to record, edit, and mix your musical creations.
Studio Monitors
Headphones
Microphone
Mic Stand
XLR Cables, Your recording studio should have two spaces: a mixing area with a desk and a recording area. These areas may be separate or joint. Equip your mixing area with a desk that can hold your computer and your mixing equipment. Set up your recording area with the mic stand, a chair, and your instruments."

, With team goals, come team incentives, so make sure everyone is interested in the incentive.

, Goals rely on accurate benchmarks and reporting., A team can work with these to cover all their bases and present a united front.

, A social drink or dinner occasionally will encourage people to support each other and strive for large goals., If someone isn’t performing, give them a chance to rectify it. However, if they don’t work hard or mesh well, tactfully reassign them.

, Ideally, this person should be willing to accept some risk and reward for their extra work.

, When you’ve created a high-performance team, they will become empowered by some independence. Rethink this if performance falls."

Select the right space.,
Consider the light.,
Protect the floor.,
Set up furniture.,
Organize your supplies.,
Add cleaning and safety supplies.,
Consider miscellaneous materials.,
Find storage space for finished work.,
Inspire yourself.",How to Set Up a Studio2," It is possible to design and create in the oddest of spaces. If you have several options, take the following factors into consideration:


Space. A space the size of an average bedroom will do, as long as you can easily store your supplies.
Ventilation. Many art and craft projects require the use of strong products that affect air quality. Choose a space that is properly ventilated through large windows or an exhaust fan.
Comfort. You'll work best at a comfortable temperature, away from damp and must, and in a private space seldom used by other people.
Easy access to a sink.

, The ideal studio has plenty of natural light from north and east windows (south and east if you are in the Southern Hemisphere). Complement this with ""full spectrum"" lighting (often sold as grow lights), which mimic natural light better than other options.You must have excellent lighting from all direction to avoid casting shadows on your work.

, Carpets and hardwood will quickly stain or suffer water damage. Stone and tile are preferred, though you will still need to wipe up spills quickly to prevent damage. You may need to lay down a canvas drop cloth, or old rugs from a thrift store.

, Your projects and work methods will determine exactly what you need, but the following list is a good start for painters and many other artists. When possible, avoid wooden tables, which inevitably warp from water damage.


One large table (or drafting table) with room to draw designs and lay out current projects
One small table for current supplies (or cart if you move around your studio)
Space for permanent storage (shelves, cupboards, etc.)
One comfortable chair, preferably adjustable
Easel, if required. Most painters prefer wood, but metal is a good lightweight option if you want to move it around. Beginners often start with a tabletop easel.

, Now you can fill the shelves and drawers with your tools and supplies. Keep your go-to supplies you use often lined up in easy reach. Save space when storing less important supplies by putting them in crates and baskets. Creative small storage options include drawer dividers, spice racks, take-out containers, and mason jars.


Use a heavy container for water to prevent tipping.
Remember that most metal containers rust. Store wet brushes in plastic cans instead.
For gesso, texturizing gels, and other liquid media, get containers wide enough to dip a spoon or brayer into, such as a plastic shoe box.
Keep a tray or two around so you can easily transport supplies you are actively using., Get some lint-free rags to wipe down projects without introducing dust and fibers. Keep more rags or paper towels near your supplies so you can wipe down lids and bottles whenever necessary. Add a trash can in a convenient location, along with a reuse/recycle can for paper and supplies you might repurpose.


If you use turpentine or other flammable materials, make sure you have a fireproof, closed-lid trash container, as well as a fire extinguisher.
Never store any supplies or artwork near a heat source, including a hot air vent.
Keep the door locked (or install a lock) if there are children or pets in the house.

, Artists use a huge range of supplies and methods. You'll discover many of these on your own, if you haven't already. If you are a beginning artist, here are a few ideas you may not have thought of:


Keep files of reference pictures. These can be instructional art books (which are also good reference sources), or your own collection of photographs, found images, and so forth.
Mini canvases to experiment with colours, textures, drying times, and so on (if painting)
Notebook for quick sketches
Eyedroppers for precise colour mixing

, Painters may need drying racks or a heavy clothesline to dry wet paintings. Once dry, you'll need a space to store paintings without them touching, or at least where you can lay them back-to-back. Laying the surface of a painting directly against another object may cause scuffing, and acrylic paints may lift off the canvas if they haven't dried completely.


Oil paintings can take weeks to dry. Finding drying space that doesn't interfere with your next project is a must.

, Hang artwork you admire on the walls, both your own pieces and those of artists you admire. If you enjoy listening to music as you create, include a radio, computer, or mP3 dock in your studio.

Select the right space.,
Equip your yoga studio.,
Heat and light your studio.",How to Set Up a Studio3," Home yoga studios require no more space than a walk-in-closet. If you do not have a room or closet to spare, consider incorporating the studio with another room, such as your bedroom or living room. Practice spaces with hardwood floors, windows, and a solid wall for inversions are ideal.


If your practice space has concrete floors, use two to three mats or lay a rug down for additional cushion., In order to practice yoga, the only necessity is a mat. You may choose to outfit your studio with an altar with candles and incense, art and statues, a meditation cushion, or a sound machine. If you use videos to guide your practice, install a T.V. or computer screen.


You may wish to place a mirror in your studio so you can assess your alignment., Heat and light can have a significant impact on your practice. Heat helps open up your body and the proper lighting sets the mood.


Consider using a plug-in heater to transform your room into a hot yoga studio.Most often, yoga is practiced in low lighting. Install dimmable lights and place shades over the windows of your studio."

The best agents will be the people who can support what you want to do, but the only way they can do that is if you have a clear sense of the kind of work you want to do.Your agent is an industry professional who will try to get you the best jobs for your career. Good agents will certainly offer advice on your decisions, but in the end the choice to try out for or take a job is yours.;
, Most agents will need to see a standard headshot, a 8x10 black and white glossy photograph, with your resume. Get one professionally done, and make sure your resume is attached to the back.This is different from a glamour shot, which will try to make you look sexy, appealing, or otherwise try to accentuate your features. Headshots are meant to be simple representations of you with minimal makeup or other preparation. It needs to be a true reflection of what you look like.While you will only send in one headshot to an agency, it is good to have several done with different looks. If you are looking to be more versatile in gigs, you’ll need to have available shots that demonstrate your ability to fill different roles.If you are a model, you should have a professional portfolio with a wider variety of image, including various colors, poses, and looks., A personal website is a good way for agents to follow up on your resume, and provide more information beyond what fits in your cover letter. Include your resume, references, contact information, and additional images or multimedia where appropriate.This is also good for publicizing yourself even without your agent’s help, which is important for growing your career.


Use these places to post any headshots and glamour shots you have. Include pieces of any performances you have done (depending on your field), making sure it reflects your chosen field. If you are a musician, for example, pictures are great, but you should also have links to some sound clips. If you don’t have access to particular clips, link to sites that do.
Don’t forget to include social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ for building a professional network and image.
Look for industry-specific sites as well, as these are places agents will likely go to check up on your background and other activities. If you are a stage actor, for example, it is a good idea to have a page on Spotlight.

, Referrals, that is information from other clients or people in the industry, are a common way for agents to choose clients.As you try out for and take various jobs, use that as a way to meet people and build your network.


Another good source for referrals can be other performers the agency represents. When you begin researching agencies, talk to the people who they already work with. Since you don’t know these people as well, you may only be able to drop their name rather than ask for a full recommendation.To ask for a referral, the person will need to know you a little bit. Talk to this person about his career, some work you are interested in doing, or maybe people you have both worked with. Make sure to talk a little bit about the agent as well, to help see if the agency might be right for your career. As long as you are polite and friendly, and building some kind of connection, it can’t hurt to ask.

, Just like you will shop for agents, agents are shopping for you. If you haven’t done a lot of work, it will be hard for an agent to see you as someone who will bring business. Beyond jobs, you’ll also want to be doing other kinds of lessons and workshops in your field to show your dedication to improving.It may be more difficult to get work without an agent, but hardly impossible. Work with people you know to develop your own smaller independent projects, like web series. Keep an eye out for open auditions, and show up. Your agent will only make it easier to find auditions and deal with paperwork, but you can certainly do those things on your own.This is another great way to build your network in your industry. The more work you do, the more experience you’ll have, and the more people who can speak to an agent about your talent and potential.

, You’ll need to be able to contact agents and agencies directly. While flipping through a local phone book can get you started, visiting agency websites to learn about the agency, who its clients are, and the kinds of work it does can help narrow your search.Look through the directories of trade organizations like the Association of Talent Agents. They will have lists of their member agencies, plus contact information.Another way to find agents is to look up who represents other talented people in your field. You should target people who are similar to you, or do work close to what you do or want to do in order to find the best agent for your career. Once you have the name of a client or agency, you can search for them directly.
Start local. If you are just getting started in the entertainment business, it will be more difficult to get signed by a big talent agency. Smaller, more local agencies may be just as good for getting your foot in the door, getting gigs on your resume, and paving the way for bigger representation later., You don’t want to send an impersonal letter to the whole agency. Instead, try to target one agent who you think you would work well with, and may have the background to help you advance your career.Do not contact multiple people in the same agency, as that will make you appear desperate and unprofessional.

, When you start researching an agent, examine the groups she is connected with and any licenses she has. This can be a good way for you to make sure the person you are dealing with has the right connections and background. Plus, if she is tied to other groups like a performers’ union, the union can provide additional information.Some more prominent professional trade groups for agents include the ATA and the National Association of Talent Representatives., This is a professional business, so you will need to act professionally when contacting agencies. Make sure your package has a brief cover letter that discusses your experience and interest in being represented by that agency. One page should be enough.Make your letter specific. One you find an agent to send your materials to, tailor your letter to address her directly. Be sure to explain not just why you would be good for her agency, but her in particular. Of course, be careful to take care of little details like spelling the agent’s name correctly., Agents are busy people who receive many letters every day, and may not be able to respond. If you haven’t heard anything back, including a rejection, send a follow up note. This is a good way to help your name rise above the pile, and make it more likely you get a response from the agency.Your note should be brief, more of a reminder. A simple email saying “I just wanted to check and see if you had a minute to look over my submission,” gives the agent something to look for.
If you are lucky, the agent may respond without prompting. In most cases, though, if you have not heard anything for two weeks, it is probably best to send a follow-up reminder., Aim to arrive at the agency about 5-10 minutes before your scheduled interview. This can give you a few minutes to use the restroom and settle your thoughts before heading int. You’ll also get a buffer of time in case you get held up for any reason on the way over., Make sure you have copies of whatever you sent in when you first contacted the agency. In addition, keep an eye on specific things the agent asks for before the interview. If he asked for them, he will expect to see them, and it will look very bad if you are unprepared.While your website is great for publicity, don’t direct the agent there during your interview. If there is something important on there, make sure you have a copy ready with you for the interview. If this includes some kind of audio or video file, make sure you have a way to present it without having to connect to your website.

, Dress for your interview should be smart casual. You are in the entertainment business, not finance. You don’t need to dress like you are going to a board meeting. The important thing is to avoid looking sloppy.For men, there is no need to wear a tie, while women should skip business wear. Keep your wardrobe to a clean, nice looking suit.
Be smart too. If you are going to need to move around for your interview, say if you are a dancer, make sure you have clothes that will allow you to do that.

, Meeting with the agent is as much of an audition as any other. Prepare your best material for when you get that call to go sit with an agent. The more variety you can get to your prepared auditions, the more flexible you can be to find something enjoyable or appropriate to demonstrate.For actors, it’s good to have 2-3 monologues ready to go. Make sure they are cover a variety of styles, such as dramatic, classical, and comedic, to show off the full range of your skills.For a field like modeling, this is where you should have a variety of your photos present to demonstrate your versatility. Be prepared with a swimsuit, or something else that will let the agency get a good look at your body., When you talk to the agency, it is good to have a few questions of your own. Ask about other clients the agency represents, the kind of work the agency has gotten its clients, and what kinds of expectations they would have for you.The interview is also to make sure you are comfortable working with this agent. Don’t be afraid to ask a few questions to learn about what he thinks of your work and career, and where he sees you going professionally. You’re going to need to rely on your agent for career advice, so it needs to be someone you feel comfortable opening up to when you speak.

Adopt a deep stance.,
Raise either your left or right hand in front of you.,
Bounce your hips up and down in small motions.,
Transition to the Nae Nae.,
Alternate your Whip dancing with the Stanky leg.,
Incorporate freestyle moves.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Whip (Dance)," The Whip is a dance that involves a deep stance, with your feet placed wide apart. To make sure you don't strain anything or lose your balance because your muscles are stiff, you should stretch your legs, paying special attention to your thighs and legs., You'll want to plant your feet on the floor so that you are well balanced and so that each food is wider than shoulder width apart. This should lower your hips, bringing you into a kind of half-squatting position. Your core should be engaged, and your back should be mostly straight with a slight lean forward.If you hunch your shoulders or curl your back forward too much, it can ruin the effect of the Whip. You want to convey both sensuality and attitude through this step.This position can work muscles in your legs that aren't frequently exercised. This means that you may notice muscle fatigue or weakness/shaking if you dance the Whip too much.
You don't want your legs to give out on you and end up sitting on the dance floor! If you feel shaking in your leg muscles or a strong burning sensation from fatigue, you may want to take a break., If you are doing this dance move in a group, you'll want to coordinate which hand you raise with the others who are dancing. Raise one arm so it's fully extended and curl your fingers into a closed fist, much like you are gripping a distant steering wheel in front of you.








Your hand should remain out in front of you for the entire time you are doing the Whip. Try not to let your arm dip too much; it should be roughly at chin level.
Your non-raised hand should be loose and rest at about hip level. You might even want to rest it on your hip, though what you do with it is up to you!
If you are doing the Whip by yourself, you might want to try alternating between hands, especially when linking your whip with freestyle moves. This can make your transitions seem more natural., This should give your body a slight bobbing movement while your feet remain stationary. Your knees and thighs will bend slightly with your bob, but most of the up and down motion should be in your hips and core.








To give your whip style more character, you may want to move your arm in front of you in time with your bobbing to the left and the right. Keep it level with your chin, and allow it to move to the left or right in time with the music.
Moving your arm in front of you is a sweet way of combining your whip dance with other freestyle moves. When your arm reaches the far left or right, you can add a spin move, or transition into another step.

, When doing the Whip, you're already mostly in position to do the Nae Nae. The Nae Nae also uses a deep stance, but instead of holding one arm in front and the other at your hip, one hand is raised above your hand and the other stretches below your hip. You'll also want to...









Rock back and forth to the left and right. Keep your feet in place and sway your hips to the beat of the music. This back and forth motion should be easy to transition to from the up and down motion of the Whip.
Add a connecting move to make your transition from the Whip to the Nae Nae more natural. You might, for example, clap your hands to the beat of the music, bringing the hand at your hip to join the one in front of you. Then spread them apart into Nae Nae position., The Stanky Leg is easy to add to the whip. From the classic Whip pose, extend one of your feet in front of you and plant it on the dance floor. Keeping your planted foot in place, lean your entire body in the opposite direction of your stationary foot. Now move your stationary foot in small, circular motions to complete the move.To continue doing the Stanky Leg, you should alternate between feet, shifting the direction you are leaning back and forth. As you do so, you might want to loosen up and bob in time with the music.
To keep your Stanky Leg fresh, you should get your arms involved in the dance. You might want to bend your arms at the elbow, moving them to the beat and crossing them in front of you.
You might add the Stanky Leg to your Whip move by allowing your Whip pose to slide into the Stanky Leg. When your arm is in front of you in classic Whip position, allow it to move to the left or right. Lean slightly as you do so, and once you've gone far enough, you should be roughly in position to do the Stanky Leg.

, Freestyle is a matter of preference, and you should do what feels right. However, you might want to break up your Whip by taking a few small steps to the beat of the music to reposition yourself on the dance floor, raising your hands in time with the music as you do so.









Another move you might add into your Whip style that is a hand twirl. You can easily raise the hand at your hip while Whipping to join the one on front of you and twirl the two around each other to give your Whip some flavor., Dancing is about expression and enjoying yourself. Experiment with what feels natural and comfortable for your body, but don't let embarrassment or self-consciousness get in the way of you enjoying yourself.









Keep an eye on others who do the Whip to learn new moves. They will likely be flattered you're trying to imitate them and they may give you some pointers!"

Choose great lighting.,
Decide on your wardrobe.,
Consider music.,
Talk to your partner, if he or she will also be in the video.,
Think about your audience.",How to Make a Sexy Video1," To start, you want to make sure you get flattering lighting. Videos with sexual content often have dim bar-like lighting, which can be a nice touch. However, when setting your lights, make sure you do some practice takes to make sure your lighting choice is flattering for your body type.Some cameras work better with certain types of lights. Dim lighting may not show up particularly well on an web cam. However, slightly higher quality cameras may work better if lighting is dimmed.
Take a few practice shoots. If you're making a video for your own use, chances are you're not using fancy stage lights. Just try experimenting with how many lights in your home are turned on or off. If you have a light that dims, try experimenting with dim-lighting. If you've never made a sexy video before, you may be a little shy. Dim or dark lighting may make you feel more comfortable.
If you're filming with another person, take a few practice shots of the two of you together. Keep in mind certain lighting can create shadows, and you may end up casting shadows on one another's bodies. Make sure this effect is not distracting before filming your video.;
, Now you can decide on your wardrobe. Choose a sexy, flattering outfit for your video.


If you're planning on doing a strip tease in the video, select an outfit with layers. It can be fun and seductive to slowly peel off one layer of clothing at a time.If you're doing a dance in the video, you want to pick clothing that's fun and revealing but that also allows you to move. For women, skin-tight leggings and a low-cut tank-top may work. For men, try a loose pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt. Many women find blue to be an attractive color on men.Keep in mind your comfort is most important. If you don't feel sexy or confident in an outfit, ditch it. If you're not feeling good about yourself, this can easily show up on camera.

, Music can be a nice touch in a sexy video, especially if you'll be stripping or dancing. Try to take some time to consider if you'll have music playing during the video.


If you're doing a dance or striptease video, consider a song that is fast-paced that you can move to. Something like ""S&M"" by Rihanna or ""Crazy"" by Aerosmith could work well.If you're doing a video with your partner, consider a slow, seductive song instead.
Many people make sexy videos to promote their own music. If you're making a video for your own song, make sure you record a good version of that song before making the video. You want to make sure the song has a high quality sound, so people viewing the video will remember your song.

, Many people make videos with themselves and romantic partners for personal use. If this is the case, you and your partner should have a frank talk ahead of time about what acts you'll be performing. You want to make sure both you and your partner are comfortable with what's being filmed.Talk ahead of time and mutually agree on what acts will be performed in the video. Never push your partner into performing an act he or she is not comfortable with.
Discuss nudity. Will both of you be nude on camera or are you okay with partial nudity? As with sex acts, if your partner is not comfortable with getting naked, you should not force him or her to do so.
You should also talk about how to store the video. In the digital age, pictures and videos are becoming less and less private. If you and your partner want the video for personal use only, make sure you talk ahead of time about how to store the video. You may not want to keep the video on a computer, for example, if that's a possibility. If you're storing the video on a computer, take measures to make sure everything is secure and password protected.

, Who are you making the video for? Many people make sexy videos for long distance partners, in which case your audience is your significant other. However, you may be making video to upload online or send to multiple recipients. If this is the case, make sure everything you do in the video is something you're comfortable with a larger audience seeing. You should also consider the future. If you're uploading something online, it will be available to an audience for years to come. Make sure anything you're distributing to a wide audience is something you're comfortable with people seeing in the future.

Do a strip tease.,
Try dirty talk.,
Dance in a sensual manner.,
Talk to your partner about what acts to film.",How to Make a Sexy Video2," A strip tease can be a fun and sexy way to start off a sexy video. There are a variety of moves you can use while engaging in a strip tease.Walk slowly when you begin your strip tease. Walk away from the camera, taking deliberate, slow steps. Then, turn and face the camera.
Use your hands to show off your body. Glide your fingers up and down your legs, hips, stomach, and chest. Move your fingers slowly over your body until you reach a button that can be undone. Slowly begin undoing each button. If you have longer hair, consider whipping your hair around a little as you go.
Move in a rhythmic manner as you remove your clothing. Take off one layer at a time. If you're playing music, try to dance to the beat of the music as you go.
You do not have to get completely nude. If you're not comfortable with nudity, you can strip down to your underwear or a layer of lingerie.

, If you're not playing loud music during your video, try dirty talk. This can be particularly helpful if you're making a video for a long distance lover. Dirty talk is a fun way to get your partner in the mood, even if you cannot physically be there.


It can help to put yourself in the right mindset prior to engaging in dirty talk. Read racy fiction, watch some pornography, read erotica, or spend time fantasizing about you and your partner. If you're nervous, do some deep breathing ahead of time to keep yourself calm.Try to let the dirty talk come naturally. Think about what you want to do with your partner. Talk about what the two of you have done in bed in the past, and mention any fantasies you have. Talk in a slow, breathy voice. Breathe heavily, as you would when aroused, as you talk.Talk about your partner as well. Talk about how sexy you find your partner, specifying what about him or her turns you on. Discuss how your partner feels and tastes. Use his or her name.If you're comfortable doing so on screen, consider masturbating while talking dirty. This can show your partner you're turned on by him or her.

, Not all sexy videos are meant to be graphic. You may be making a sexy video to market yourself as a model or an actor or actress, or as an accompaniment to a music video. If this is the case, consider filming a sexy dance.


You can study popular sexually charged music videos. Artists like Lady Gaga frequently dance in provocative manner in videos. Watch a variety of sexy music videos for inspiration.
Pick dance moves that you're personally comfortable with. If you're not into doing a move, this can show up in subtle ways during your performance. Try to relax and engage in dance moves you genuinely enjoy. If you don't feel confident, you won't come off as sexy.
Gyrating the hips, shaking your behind, and moving in a slow, teasing manner are all popular dance moves for a sexy video.

, If you're filming a sex tape with your partner, talk it out ahead of time. Decide which acts to film, and also talk about angles. The angle from which you film makes a big difference in terms of the film's quality.Discuss what you'll be filming ahead of time. A sexy video with your partner does not necessarily have to include penetrative sex, and shouldn't if you or your partner is uncomfortable with this. You can film things like oral sex, mutual masturbation, or simply film the two of you engaging in dirty talk. Making a sexy video should be a fun, mutually enjoyable activity, so don't push your partner to engage in anything that makes him or her uncomfortable.
Consider angle. You do not want the focus to be solely on your partner. Consider using a small, lightweight camera you can pass back and forth during filming. This gives your partner a chance to film you, capturing the angles of your body he or she likes best. Make sure the two of you talk about what body parts are and are not okay to film ahead of time.

Keep the video private if it includes sexual acts.,
Send videos to small audiences carefully.,
Be aware of the legal consequences.",How to Make a Sexy Video3," If your video includes sexual acts, it's a good idea to keep it private. Unless you work in the adult film industry, you could potentially get in trouble with your school or place of work if a sexual video of you surfaces. Store sexy videos offline and always password protect computers or other devices that contain adult videos.Many people share content online, through social media sites like Facebook. People commonly express regret at posting sexual content online after some time has passed. Even a mildly sexy video can be cause of embarrassment for you down the road. Also, if an employers googles your name and finds you connected to sexual content, this could affect your employment depending on the ethics of your place of work.
If you film a video with your partner, talk ahead of time about what to do with the video in the event you break up. It's a good idea to mutually agree to destroy or delete the video in the event of a breakup. You and your partner may feel uncomfortable with the idea of an ex having access to a very intimate video of you.
Make sure you only film sexual videos with someone you trust completely. Unfortunately, sometimes people upload sexual content of former partners online in an industry known as ""revenge porn."" This can cause a great deal of emotional turmoil.

, If you made a video for a long distance partner, be careful in how you send the video. There are a lot of simple tricks you can use to send sensitive information securely.Break sensitive information into chunks. This can help confuse hackers. If you uploaded a sexy video on a password protected site, or onto your iCloud account, e-mail your partner something like, ""I'm texting you my iCloud password."" Then, send the password out of context in a separate text.
Dropbox is a service where you can share files and videos. While it's an online service, it's fairly secure as it encrypts all user information.
Keep in mind sensitive data is best exchanged in person. Nothing is completely secure online, unfortunately. If you can upload a sexy video onto a DVD, and give it to your partner in person, this is the best route for sharing a sexy video. If your partner can't play a DVD, consider uploading the video on a USB drive instead.

, Sexual content shared via the internet and a smart phone is never private. If you are underage, you can face felony charges in some states for distributing child pornography. You may even end up having to register as a sex offender. Think carefully before sharing sexually explicit content via online outlets as it can have serious consequences for your future.If you are underage, some states have strict laws regarding distributing images of a minor. If you text sexually explicit videos of yourself to a boyfriend or girlfriend, you could end up in serious trouble. In Oregon, California, and Georgie, for example, sexting can potentially fall under child pornography laws, and could be considered a felony offense. Sexting between minors, however, is sometimes viewed as a lesser charge depending on the situation. In some states, like Georgie and Alabama, stricter laws about sexting could result in you ending up on a sex offender registry.Other states have slightly more lenient sexting laws. In Louisiana, for example, if a minor is caught distributing sexual images of themselves they may face mandatory counseling or another minor form of punishment.You should review your state's specific laws regarding sexting and sexual content. Laws vary greatly by state, and you should know the potential legal consequences before sending someone a sexy video.

If you have never performed the act of grinding before don't worry.,
Politely ask the girl you want to grind with if you can, in fact, grind with her.,
After you have been grinding for a little the girl may start to do some other moves.,
Watch the signs she sends you.,
If you want to change things up you can try a front to front grind.,
If there is a slow part to a song this is a good chance to go in for a kiss.,
If you see two girls grinding with each other this is a great opportunity.,
If you really like a certain girl and would like to continue with her through the night give her a break.",How to Grind Dance (Guys)," Look for a girl that is doing a simple side to side motion with her hips. Some girls do a figure 8 motion, but it is suggested to be tried side to side first.;
, If your request is accepted, gently place your hands at her hips and sway to the beat.

, She may lean forward, put her hands on her knees, and start to move her butt up and down against your pelvic area. Just stand there while she does it, you can either keep your hands on her hips or place them on her back. She may do some moves that are specific to the song like ""pop, lock, and drop it"". Don't try to follow her on these moves.

, If she smiles or leans back into you, or she's telling her friend what a great time she's having, you can take it a little further. Try moving your hand to her inner thigh and leaning your head into her neck, but don't go too fast. Some girls like to keep things slow.

, this is where you put your left leg (or right leg if your left footed) in between her legs. Sway your hips from side to side and start with your hands on her hips after a while you can try to lower your hands down onto her butt. Slowly get closer throughout the song.

, Put a hand on her shoulder and turn her around so shes facing you. Then move your hands to her back. Now go in for the kiss! If she smiles or comes back in for another this means she liked it and wants more. So begin to kiss her more and longer until you are making out.

, Squeeze in between them and grind normally with the one in front of you. The girl behind you will put her hands on your hips and grind with you from behind. This is called a sandwich.

, After a song ends grab her hand, walk to the refreshments area, and buy her a drink. This gives both of you a chance to cool down. Try to start a conversation and get her number. After a few minutes head back to the dance floor.

Stand with your feet just a bit more than a shoulder width apart, in front of a mirror.,
Step your right foot out a little bit.,
Keep your torso mostly still as you do this.,
Step your left foot out slightly.,
Return your feet to their original position, about shoulder width apart.",How to Shake Your Hips1," This is the proper width for your feet when doing this dance move. It will help you engage your core muscles. You'll also want your knees to be slightly bent. You want to let your abs do the work when you shake your hips, not your legs or back., It should go forward and to the right. Swing your hips to the right with your foot.Make a big swooping motion with your hips to the front then to the right.
Finish the move by completing a circle with your hips to the back then to the front.
Keep your abdominal muscles tight and engaged as you do this.
Women will want to make this move very large and more dramatic, following the natural way their hips curve.

, You only want your hips to move, not your entire upper body. At the most, you might want to complement the move of your hips by sliding your upper torso slightly to the left.


If you aren't doing it correctly, your hip movements might be too small or your upper torso might be moving with you.

, Now, you'll repeat the motions on the opposite side. Swing your hips to the left with your foot. Make a large swooping motion with your hips to the front then to the left.
Make sure your upper torso and chest are still when you shake your hips. You only want your hips to swing out, not the rest of your upper body.
If your upper torso is moving along with you, you aren't doing the move correctly.
Complete the move by swinging your hips to the back, then to the front.
Remember to use your abs rather than your legs or back muscles to help you do this dance move.
Make your motions big. These will feel exaggerated at first, but will look good during dancing.

, You can now combine the moves from the right and left. Remember to keep your knees slightly bent and your movements loose and flowing.Swing your hips out to the front, then to the right, along with your right foot.

Start with your feet shoulder width apart.,
Take a step to the side with your right foot.,
Repeat the process for the left side.,
Return your feet to the front, keeping your feet shoulder width apart.",How to Shake Your Hips2," Face a mirror so you can watch as you practice. This is very similar to the method for how girls shake their hips, but for guys it will be less exaggerated and the move will be slightly different.This stance will provide stability as you perform the dance move.
Standing in this position will help you use your core muscles to perform the dance move.
You want to avoid using your back and leg muscles to swing your hips. The move will not look right and you could end up straining you muscles if not done properly.

, You will move your hips along with your foot to the right side. Tuck your pelvis under. This will prevent your moves from being wide and exaggerated.
Rotate your pelvis forward, then to the right.
Rotate it towards the back, then to the left again.
While you do this, keep your movements subtle and keep your pelvis tucked under.
When a guy does a hip shaking move in dance, it is typically a smaller more understated move than when a girl performs this type of dancing.
If you are doing this move correctly, your upper torso should stay still and in place. Your hips will not swing out dramatically to the side, but rather rotate in a small circle with your pelvis tucked under.

Practice Latin dancing.,
Try belly dancing.",How to Shake Your Hips3," This will incorporate very energetic and exaggerated hip shaking moves, just like how they are described in Parts I and II. Incorporate hip shaking along with pop and lock movements for street dancing.
Hip-hop dancing often also uses booty shaking along with hip shaking.

Think about how energetic dancers like Beyonce and other performers are when they move their hips.

, Hip movements are very key to how the body moves in Latin dance.In Latin dancing hip shaking is incorporated with rhythmic dance steps in dances like the tango and merengue.
Dancers move their hips out when they step forward in back in rhythm with music.
As you perform a Latin style dance, you will be alternating steps with your right and left feet. As you step with your right foot, rotate that hip outwards slightly. Do the same when you step with your left foot.
Latin dancing incorporates more natural looking and subtle hip movements than hip hop and street dancing. With Latin dancing, you won't be exaggerating this movement, but allowing your hips to move loosely in a natural pattern.
Shakira is a very famous Latin artist famous for hip shaking. Her dancing is slightly more similar to contemporary hip-hop than traditional Latin dancing.

, Like with Latin dancing, hip movements are some of the most key aspects of belly dance.In belly dancing, hip shaking is one of the most important techniques

Smile, remember your technique, and have fun!",How to Prepare for a Feis," If you absolutely can't go to class, like if you are sick, injured, or have a busload of homework, don't go, but if you're just lazy and don't feel like going - go. In class, you will work on your technique. ans learn new steps, which will only help you at your feis.;
, If your teacher says you need to improve on something, try to think about it while you practice. Eventually, you will always do it, and it will just be a natural thing you do while you dance.

, You will be amazed at how much easier class is if you practice. You should be practicing at least this much a day, every day:


Beginner: 15 minutes
Advanced beginner: 30 minutes
Novice: 45 minutes to 1 hour
Prizewinner: 2 hours
Preliminary or open champ: 3 hours

, Talk with your parents and see how far they're willing to take you. If you see a feis your parents are willing to take you to-sign up!

, If you only practiced when you felt like it- discipline yourself. If you want to do well in your feis, you need to practice.

, Are your hard shoes getting small? Go buy new ones. Need a new solo dress? Find one. Now is the time to get those last-minute stuff.

, Take it out of the dress bag and closet and lay it outside.If your dress has panels, place it flat on a table and put books on the panels to make them flat and stiff. Make sure it is in a safe place,though.

, As the feis gets closer and closer, feed your body better and better. Try to limit sugars and fats, and get lots of protein and a limited amount of carbs so you'll have energy on feis day.

, While you may not be able to improve everything your teacher says you need to improve, it will still help.

sock glue
soft shoes
hard shoes

Makeup, if you're wearing it.
Deodorant
An mp3 player or iPod with practice music on it
A first-aid kit
A water bottle
Healthy, energizing snacks
Your dress or vest

, Practice for about an hour at most, maybe more if you're in an upper level, but don't come home from school, practice, eat dinner, and go to sleep.

, You may be tense for tomorrow, but truth is, you really need to wind down. Try taking a long, hot bath or shower, reading a book, or taking a nice walk around the block.

, Again, you may be so excited or tense you might find it hard to sleep, but you need it! It will charge your body, and if you are only half awake, you might find yourself forgetting your step or doing your hornpipe in the treble jig!

,, If you have to leave for the feis at 6:30, give yourself adequate time to get ready, at least an 2 hours.

, Don't skip!! You need the energy! If you don't eat any breakfast, you'll get hungry and won't have enough energy, which will show in your dancing., Try to show some school spirit, wear as much stuff from your dance school as you can! Put on a tank top or t-shirt and shorts. If it is cold out, grab a sweatshirt and sweatpants. If you're a girl, wear a sports bra.

, Make sure you have everything, or make a checklist.

, Grab a buddy, book, or some video games to entertain yourself.

, Give each other feedback, and cheer each other on.

, Get the feel of them and see what it will be like when you compete., Check on the feis website to see if any scheduling changes are made. Keep in mind, though, that they can run fast or slow.

, Stop eating half an hour before your first competition and use the bathroom, from then on, only take occasional, little sips of water. That way, your stomach won't be full, which will not be fun to dance with.

, I personally like to do the wig at home, to get rid of added stress. You don't want to stay in your costume too long, but you need to allow yourself adequate time to change.

, Try not to line up with someone from your school, as they may be doing the same steps as you.

, Enjoy, and dance your best!

, Repeat the two steps to the left, to steps to the right, rockstep rhythm. This is the basic East Coast Swing.

, Since swing is meant to be done with a great deal of space around dancers, you can take traveling steps to move around your section of the dance floor. There is little established pattern, although a star or diamond shape is a good way to start. Move in whatever way feels natural to you.

, You can add basic flourishes to this dance. One way is to push distance between partners as you take your rockstep, returning together as you return to starting position. Another way is to spin your partner, either outward or under your arm, as the first two steps are taken, returning on the second two steps.

Learn a bit about the two-step.,
Understand the moves.,
Practice.",How to Two Step1," Two-step is a common step in multiple types of dances. Some of these steps are highly similar, while in others they are completely different movements. You will have to determine which two-step is the right one for you. This article discusses the country two-step, often called Texas two-step.


Developed from a hybrid of the Mexican dances and the traditional German dances brought to Texas in generations past, as well as heavy influence from the Foxtrot, the country two-step is a very basic dance frequently used in the bar and dance scene in the Southern US.;
, Before you try the dance, it is a good idea to understand the moves themselves. Read or watch the steps involved until you are confident you know what moves to execute and when. This will help keep you from becoming confused when practicing.


YouTube and other internet video sites are great places to look for instructional videos as well as variations and tips on the dances.

, Before attempting the dance with a partner or in a more serious context, you will want to practice. There are a variety of options, should you want to practice on your own or with help.


Practicing on your own can be a more comfortable method, if you are not confident or shy in front of others. It can also be a good way to learn at your own pace, in your own time.
Practicing with others. You can also take a class or learn in the dance environment itself. There are many classes available, either through your local community center or through nearby dance-schools and clubs. It is also possible to learn from participating with others in dance halls and bars. Learning from others will give you a more authentic experience and will probably be much more fun than learning by yourself.

Set up your frame.,
Maintain the correct distance.,
Get into position.",How to Two Step2," The dance frame refers to the shape maintained by couples during the dance. The basic two-step in its most common position will have a traditional, closed frame. Framing is very important as it allows the lead to guide the follower by placing pressure at key points, reducing the likelihood of hurting your partner.


The lead will place their right hand on the followers left shoulder blade. It should not be cupping the bottom of the shoulder blade but rather placed across the middle section of the shoulder blade. The lead’s left hand will hold the follower’s right out at their side. This should be loose and bent slightly.
The follower will place their left hand at the top of the lead’s right arm. The follower’s fingertips should be roughly at the shoulder seam of the lead’s shirt. The follower will place their right hand in the lead’s left, again at their side and bent slightly.

, The distance between the couples will depend on the dance position chosen but the most basic position should leave the couple with a few inches between them. It should be such that you can easily spin your partner and guide them without placing too much pressure.

, There are a number of different positions from which the two-step can be executed. Beginners may want to use the most basic position in order to learn the dance. Other positions can be chosen based on personal preference or based on the positions chosen by surrounding couples if dancing in a hall or bar. Here are three position variations to try:


Standard position variation: One way to stay in the standard position but change it slightly is to stand closer together. It is possible to dance with chests touching but the feet will need to be moved. To dance in this position, place the feet so that they are more side-by-side, with the follower’s foot placed between the lead’s.
Cuddle position: In this position the dancers will be side-by-side. The follower’s left arm will cross their body to hold the lead’s right hand. The follower’s right arm will cross their left and holds the lead’s left hand near the follower’s left elbow.
Shadow: In this position the follower stands in front of the lead. The lead places their right hand over the follower’s stomach with the follower’s right hand placed over the lead’s. The lead and follower will hold their left hands together, out at the side and bent slightly as in the standard position.

"
"
Have the lead step forward with their left while the follower steps backwards with their right.,
Next, have the lead step forward with their right as the follower steps backwards with their left.,
On the third and fourth beat, have the lead step forward again with their left while the follower steps backwards with their right.,
On the fifth and sixth beat, have the lead step forward again with their right while the follower steps backwards with their left.,
Follow the line of dance.",How to Two Step3," This is the first step and should be danced quickly on the first beat. The basic dance is composed of four steps, two quick and then two slow. The slow steps will be held twice as long as the quick ones. These are counted in beats, similar to other dances and music. , This step should be danced quickly on the second beat.

, This step, however, should be a slow step instead of the quick step done in Step 1.

, Again, this step should be slow instead of quick.

, The steps above will follow what is called the line of dance. This is an imaginary line around the outside of a dance floor. The faster you intend to dance, the further towards the outside you should be. Line of dance moves counterclockwise.


It is important, when dancing with other couples, to maintain the line of dance. This keeps you from bumping into others and hurting yourself or them.

"
"
Learn some variations.,
Add flourishes.",How to Two Step4," The steps of the dance can be as varied as the positions. This can be achieved by changing the order of the steps or by changing the direction of movement. You will have to decide what is best, based on your skill level and the movements of the other dancers.


For example, it is possible to take only one slow step, instead of two.

, Make your dance more complex, beautiful, and fun by adding flourishes such as turns. You can also use these moves to switch into different two-step positions.


You can do a basic turn very easily. After completing the first set of steps (quick, quick, slow, slow), the lead will release the follower. Keeping left hands joined, the follower will spin and then settle back into the starting position. The turn should take another set of four steps to execute, so that when the follower settles it is time to start the next set of four steps.
If you want something more complex, you can switch into a side-by-side position from the standard position. This begins after the first slow step, as the follower moves their right arm down to their lower back. The lead moves their right hand down to take the follower’s, opening the position and allowing the follower to spin. The follower will then settle so that the lead and follower have right hands joined at the followers right shoulder and left hands joined out at the side and bent slightly.

Dress up like Michael Jackson.",How to Spin Like Michael Jackson," Not every type of shoe will be easy or even possible to spin in. A pair of shoes with too much grip will make it nearly impossible to spin. The soles of the shoes shouldn’t be too slippery either, or you could fall easily. Some shoes, like high heels, can be dangerous to spin in if you’re not very careful. A pair of flat dress shoes with a smooth sole would work well too practice in.It may be easiest to start out with socks until you get comfortable with the spinning motion.
Do a simple spin on your own to test out the shoes.;
, You may want to dress up later, but start with comfortable clothes to begin with. Very tight clothes restrict your movement and make it difficult to practice. Wear a pair of loose pants, sweatpants, or leggings. Put on any type of shirt that you feel comfortable wearing. Workout or dance attire is ideal while you’re practicing., It’s much easier to practice the spin when you have some music on to motivate you. Ideally, you should put on a Michael Jackson song since he was the one to popularize the spin. Songs like “Billie Jean” and “Smooth Criminal” could work well. If you can’t find a Michael Jackson song or don’t want to practice to one of his songs, then put on any sing that you enjoy dancing to. Keep in mind that the spin may not be recognized if you don’t do it to a Jackson song., The best way to learn about spinning like Michael Jackson is by watching the man himself. You can look up videos on YouTube of Jackson spinning. Full length videos of his hits, like Billie Jean and Smooth criminal, are available to watch. You can also watch spin compilations if you only want to specifically focus on examples of the spin., Michael Jackson couldn’t have done his famous spin on the wrong type of flooring. Some floors can be dangerous to spin on and promote injury. For example, a carpeted floor would not be easy to spin on, and it could aid injury. Outside environments, like the grass and sidewalk would not work well either. A smooth, concrete floor, linoleum floor, and wooden floors would be possible to spin on. The type of floor in a dance studio is ideal., Begin by facing the front of whatever room you are in. Stand with your back straight. Put your left hand on your stomach, right arm at your side, and right foot about six inches behind your left. This is the stance you will begin with.Stand with your left foot back and right foot front if you want to spin in the opposite direction.

, Bring your right foot quickly to your left in a slight kicking motion. The foot should land on the left side of your left foot. Your legs will be crossed. Your left foot will be flat on the ground, and the right foot will be in demi-pointe.Demi-pointe means rising up onto the ball of your foot. Your heel should be off of the ground in this position.

, Begin turning your right shoulder to the left side of the room. When your body is no longer facing front, cross your arms over your body. Crossing your arms will help you spin., When you begin to spin, left your left heel off of the ground slightly. You don’t have to lift it very high off of the ground. Only lift it enough so that the weight is on the ball of your left foot. On your right foot, lift your toes off of the ground. Your weight should be on your heel.Your right heel should be off of the ground if you’re spinning in the opposite direction.

, Practice the spin a few times very slowly to get the motions down. Once you understand the mechanics of the spin, you will need to use force to help you spin quickly. Gather the momentum for your spin by using force when you kick your right leg forward and cross it over your left leg. Moving your right shoulder to the left will help with the momentum of the spin as well., Once you start to lose balance or turn quickly, uncross and separate your feet. If you are having trouble stopping, stomp your right foot on the ground for a firm stop. Don’t keep your legs crossed when you are finished spinning because you could easily lose balance., It might be difficult to watch yourself while initially learning the spin, but watch yourself once you have learned the basic motion. Watching yourself in the mirror is the best way to see what you’re doing wrong and right. Record yourself while practicing with a smartphone, camera, or video recorder to get a better look at yourself later.

, While you are practicing the spin, keep a positive attitude. Michael Jackson most likely put a lot of work into perfecting his spin. He also had the help of choreographers and an optimal setting. Keep this in mind if you grow frustrated with spinning during the learning and practicing process. Once you have learned the spin, maintain a confident attitude and look on your face to pull of the Michael Jackson persona., Work on a single spin at first. Practice and carry out the single spin until you are confident you have perfected it. Try two spins when you are bored with a single spin. You can achieve multiple spins by increasing the force of the kick and tightening your abdominal muscles as you turn.A smooth floor and smooth shoe soles helps you achieve the multiple spins.

, You can dress up like Michael Jackson while you’re practicing to achieve the right mindset, or you can dress up like him to show off your newly learned move. Michael Jackson had a lot of looks, but choose a look that would be highly recognizable. Wear a white button-up shirt, black pants (as tight or loose as you’re comfortable with), and a black blazer. Wear black dress shoes that you have practiced spinning in. To finish the look, wear one, glittery or sequined glove on your right hand. A white or silver glove is ideal."

Get in the right posture.,
Tuck your butt underneath your pelvis.,
Pop your butt back out.,
Repeat this movement.,
Pump your arms.,
Add the jump (optional).",How to Shake Your Booty1," Start off with your legs a little wider than shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent and relaxed. Keep your shoulders back and arch your back slightly so that your butt is sticking out. Don't stick your butt out purposely, it will happen naturally when you arch your back;
, Your lower back should now be in a straight line. In other words, your lower back should be at about 90 degrees -- not bent forward or backward. Your shoulders, however, should come forward slightly, and your knees should still be bent., As you do this, roll your pelvis back. Arch your lower back and push your chest forward and your shoulders back. This should help you pop your butt out. Practice rolling your hips back if necessary.

, Start with your hips vertical at 90 degrees. Then, arch your back and roll your hips back. Start off slowly to get the technique down and then gradually increase your speed. Try to do the booty pop as fast as you can without compromising your form.

, Beyoncé's signature booty pop includes simultaneous pumping of the arms. To nail this move, start off holding your arms up at your chest with your elbows bent at about 45 degrees with the inside of your wrists facing toward you. Your hands should be in loose fists. When you pop your butt out, pull your arms apart slightly and push your chest forward. When you tuck your butt back under, bring your arms back toward each other and your shoulders forward. Continue this simultaneous movement.

, Beyonce occasionally jumps into her booty popping move. To do this, stand in your normal stance with your feet shoulder width apart. Then, simply hop forward slightly and immediately start shaking your butt in the manner described. Reserve this move after you've mastered all the other steps.

"

Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.,
Squat down.,
Rotate your hips forward and rotate back.,
Put your hands on your knees.,
Rotate your hips backward.",How to Shake Your Booty2," This gives you a good base so you don’t topple over as you booty shake. Plant your feet and distribute your body weight evenly across the front and back of your feet. Make sure that you have a wide enough stance. The wider your stance, the more stable you’ll be as you dance., Your back should remain straight, upright and vertical. You shouldn’t be leaning too forwards or too far backwards. As you bend your knees and squat down low, but make sure you feel stable. You shouldn’t feel like you’re about to fall over.


This is a central position for this style of booty shake.

, The actual movement of body shaking only calls for moving your hips back. However, it’s good to know what it feels like when you’re moving your hips in both directions, so that you can feel if you’re doing it correctly. Practice moving the hips forward and then moving it back. Keep your torso straight as you do this.Moving the hips back is what creates the booty shake movement. This is an isolated movement. So, you’re only rotating your pelvis back. If you’re not used to doing this movement, you’ll have to practice moving your hips back because this movement is pivotal to this form of booty shaking. Essentially, moving your hips back is the booty shake.

, This is more or less for style. However, you also can do it to help stabilize yourself as you start to move. Don’t lean forward when you do this because your back should remain straight.

, Start in the central position, then move your hips back. Do this slowly at first until you have the hang of it. You may shift your weight to your heels as you do this. Then, move your butt out faster. Now, you should be booty shaking. Practice a lot until you get the hang of it.

"
Stand with your legs shoulder width apart.,
Sway from side to side.,
Twist from side to side.,
Lessen the twisting range of motion.,
Bend over.",How to Shake Your Booty3," Since you’re shifting your body weight , this gives you a strong base so that you don’t topple over. Your feet should be about the same distance apart as your shoulders, and they should be parallel to each other. Point your toes forward., Swing your hips from left to right. Repeat this motion until you have a good feel for the movement. This is just so you understand the basic movement that you’ll be doing.This is a preparatory step for learning the booty shake.

, Increase your range of motion as you sway side-to-side and twist back-and-forth. Twist your hips forward and backward. As you are twisting, release your butt cheeks. Do not squeeze them together. Twist quickly, and you should feel your butt cheeks smack against each other or jiggle.


This is an isolated movement, so only your pelvis should be moving. Do not bend your back.

, Instead of twisting as much as you were before in the previous step, lessen it so that you are still twisting but about half as much. However, continue to twist at the same fast rate as before that made your butt jiggle.


It shouldn’t look like you’re twisting even though you are.
Your knees should be just about locked as you do this.

, With your feet still at about shoulder width apart, bend over at about a 90 degree angle. Then, continue to twist with the same limited range of motion as before. Continue to shake or twist quickly and repeat for as long as you want.


Don’t let your arms dangle. You don’t want them looking like silly string as you shake. Bend them at about a 90 degree angle."

,
Practice.",How to Stand En Pointe," You cannot try this unless you are strong enough to be en pointe. Listen to what your instructor has to say and do not attempt the en pointe work until he or she states that you are ready.;
, The feet and ankles need to be strong, with the ability to control the joints in these areas being equally important. Rising to pointe and lowering back down depend on it. The ankles also need to be stable to support a sustained balance on your toes. Strong calf muscles are also required to pull off these skills. Each of these things can be achieved through the exercises done in ballet class. It also helps to have a solid core, which can be gained from ballet.


Pilates is another excellent way to strengthen the core, if dancing itself isn't doing that for you.

, Being overweight while dancing on pointe could lead to health problems, because it puts too much pressure on the toes. You may damage your ankles or even worse break or fracture them which will mean that you will have to leave off training for a sufficient amount of weeks/months (Depending on the injury) before you can continue training and by then your strength, skill, flexibility, etc., will have deteriorated. This also means you will be back at square one and it will take you even longer to be able to stand on en pointe.

, Practice every step correctly, knowing it will transfer to your pointe work eventually.


It's common to study ballet for at least two to three years in soft shoes before going on pointe.

, This is vital for being safe and avoiding injuries on pointe.

,, The releve must include the ability to balance on demi pointe while keeping the ankles still. This ability is extremely important.

, Ask them what you personally need to do to reach your goal of being on pointe. Let him or her know that you're serious about it.

, The shoes should have been properly prepared beforehand, with the ribbons and elastic attached as required. Once you have the shoes on, make sure that the elastic and ribbons are properly attached to your legs.


Ensure that your dance instructor has approved the shoes before using them.
The block end of the shoe is known as the box or the block. It is this end that you will be standing on.

,, Remember your turnout. This is very important in preventing injuries and becoming stronger in dance. Maintain the correct ballet posture - open chest, pulled back shoulders, etc. Try to ""lift"" out of your hips and towards the ceiling, don't relax into that position.

, Squeeze your legs together as tightly as you can. Pretend there is a dollar bill between your thighs and you don't want to drop it.

, Start to do a relevé, and stop once you are on demi-pointe. Now is when the fun starts: Squeeze your butt as if your life depends on it to get en pointe.


When you go up, go up all the way up onto the box. If you don't, you can seriously injure your ankles because of the extra strain it puts on them.

,, Once you are ready to come down, squeeze your butt even more to control the way you come down. This is a relevé.

,, Once you are pretty strong in your legs, you will (most likely) be able to do some fun, sassy walks on pointe. Once you're confident and comfortable with the basics, you'll enjoy doing the moves from ""center stage""––as long as you are prepared enough to do so!

Put on your pointe shoes.,
Position your foot.,
Wrap the inside ribbon.,
Wrap the outer ribbon.,
Make a knot.,
Tuck the ribbons.",How to Tie Pointe Shoes," Make sure you have some proper fitting pointe shoes with the ribbons sewed on.Make adjustments to your shoe as necessary (slipping your foot through elastic straps, tightening the pointe shoes’ drawstring, etc.).


Be sure that you are wearing your toe pads and any other accessories that you use while wearing your pointe shoes.;
, When tying pointe shoes, sit on the ground and have your foot flat on the floor. Your leg should be bent at the knee, creating a 90° angle between your ankle and your leg.This ensures that when you tie your pointe shoes, your ankle is flexed, giving the ribbons slack when you actually stand up on the pointes.
That way, you don’t initially tie your pointe shoes too tight, hurt yourself with the taut ribbons, and cut off circulation when you come down from pointe with you feet flat on the floor.

, Bring the ribbon on the inside of the pointe shoe across the top of your foot. Wrap the ribbon across the top of your foot so the ribbon lies just on top of your protruding outer ankle bone. Bring the ribbon across the back of your ankle (over your Achilles tendon), and back to the side of your inner ankle.Make sure you pull tight enough on the ribbon so there aren’t any folds or gaps when the ribbon crosses your foot.The inside ribbon is going to be wrap around your ankle more than the outside ribbon. This will give your ankles added stability.

, While holding the inside ribbon in place on the inside of your ankle, use your other hand to cross the outside ribbon over the top of your foot to the opposite inner side of your ankle. Bring the outside ribbon over the inside ribbon you are holding in place, and wrap it around the back of your ankle (across your Achilles tendon). Then bring it back to the front of your foot (staying above your outer ankle bone), and bring it straight across the front of your ankle.You should bring it all the way over the front of your ankle, to meet with the inner ribbon you have been holding in place on the inside of your ankle.


Again, make sure that you are wrapping the ribbon tight enough that there are no gaps or folds in the ribbon, and then ribbon is taut against your skin.

, With both ribbons at your inner ankle, bring the outer ribbon under the inner ribbon that you had been holding in place, loop the outer ribbon over the inner ribbon, and feed the outer ribbon down through the hole between the crossed ribbons and your ankle. Pull both ribbons taut. Then repeat that same looping and pulling motion with the outer ribbon to make a tight knot.


The knot should fall on the side of the ankle, in the divot between the inner ankle bone and the back of the ankle on top of the Achilles tendon.This is the perfect spot for the knot to be placed so the pointe shoe ribbons can still keep a relatively flat profile on the ankle.

, Once the knot is made, turn the remaining ribbon strands into the inside of the wrapped ribbons around your ankle. Use your fingers to push the remaining ribbons down into place.


You can use hairspray or even sew the knot into place with the ribbons for added security.
If there is way too much extra ribbon after you have tied the knot, consider trimming the ends of the ribbon. However, leave enough ribbon that you can easily tie your pointe shoes in the future. This is especially important if you alternate which foot you wear your pointe shoes on, because the ribbon lengths need to be longer depending on which foot the pointe shoe is worn.Trimming the ribbons on a slanted angle may help with reducing the fraying of the cut ribbons."

Give yourself 6 months to a year to plan your first event.,
Keep a book of your expenses & receipts.,
Choose an instructor.,
Choose a venue for your event.,
Things to consider for your venue:


How many people will be able to dance with an unobstructed view?,
Many lovely banquet halls perfect for such event require you purchase their catering.,
Advertise your event on-line in every possible forum and send out emails in by mass, small batches or individually.,
Make a flyer for you event, events advertised only by internet do not garner as much interest as an event put into writing.,
Important information to enclose on your flyer, website, and emails.,
Print up your flyers and leave in places dancers frequent: studios, restaurant.,
Choose your vendors carefully.,
When you begin to have people sign-up, send them a pleasant email with a confirmation number.,
Before the day of the event recruit volunteers to work the registration table and to be stage hands such as working the sound system or helping ladies in the dressing room get to the stage on time.

,
Create a program.,
On the day of the event vendors must set up early.,
Check your sound equipment.

,
Make sure your volunteers understand their responsibilities.,
Introduce yourself and introduce your instructor before class begins.

,
Act as a hostess as much as possible, even if you plan to take the class.

,
Immediately after workshop finishes, begin to set up for the show.

,
Have a ""Music Box"" where performers will drop-off their CDs/music.,
Begin check-in for the show an hour in advance, allowing shopping time with vendors.,
Start on time.,
Have an intermission halfway through if your show is longer than 2 hours.

,
Close the show by thanking the volunteers and performers, show support for the next belly dance event in your community.

,
Invite all performers up on stage to take a bow and allow for photos.",How to Sponsor Your First Belly Dance Workshop and Show," Avoid summer dates. Fall and Spring are better choices. Keep a calendar of big dance events in your area, as well as sporting events, etc. You don't want to hold your event on a ""big game"" day like Super Bowl or the weekend another teacher holds her annual recital.;
, For tax purposes as well as managing your money.

, Travel out of your area to attend a workshop with an instructor. If you like her, ask her about coming to your area before you leave. Instructors charge $100 to $300 an hour plus room and travel. Luckily, the teaching fee generally includes a free performance. Do not hire instructors other sponsors bring to your area. Do not hire instructors from a video because you like their performance. Great artists are not always great teachers. If you have never taken a class with the instructor you are considering, make sure she is active on the workshop circuit. Hiring your favorite performer from overseas may be tempting, but adds a possible language barrier and work-visa challenge.

, The venue, not the instructor, will mostly likely be the most expensive part of your investment. Some venues are insured, others, like schools, may expect you to purchase one-day event insurance.

,
How much will you need to charge each dancer to cover that cost?
Can you have swap tables or vendors?
What type of flooring?(serious dancers prefer a wooden floor)
Are there mirrors?
Is there a place for performers to dress besides the bathrooms?
Is there a sound system or must you bring your own?
Will participants have trouble parking?
Is there food and drink available nearby?

, This will add to the cost of what you must charge. Belly dancers are generally hobbyists on a tight budget. Don't go over-board. A small benefit can be providing food will encourage dancers to bring their friends & families.

, You do not need to be completely web savvy to make a simple free web-page containing all the information you have on your flyer.

, For every one person you wish to attract, you may need to print about 10-20 flyers or 250-500 flyers for a workshop of 30 people. Be economical: a tri-folded standard piece of paper, printed double-sided black & white works well. It can hold all the details a person needs to know. Postcards are attractive, but do not allow for much information. Ask your instructor to provide you with her own photo postcard or business card to enclose with your flyer event.

, Use clip art to create a theme, but use large, easy to read font, for important information. Include these items:


A photo of the instructor
A short Bio of her, including website
Level of workshop: beginner, advanced, speciality, etc.
The source of the music she will use to teach
A description of the techniques or choreography she will teach.
Props students must bring (zills, skirt, veil, etc)
Your contact information, address & phone.
Venue address & phone.
Advance ticket prices, at the door prices. Discounts for groups (5 or more works well)
Directions and/or map
Accurate dates and times, including day of the week.
vendor names & websites
Payment options: considering setting up a PayPal account to take credit cards in advance.
Are children welcome and will they have a special price.
Are cameras and videos allowed?
Disclaimers. No refunds for Acts of God, but allowing refunds more than 3 days in advance is considerate. Include a ""Hold Harmless"" agreements: a simple statement declaring participants are taking this class at their own risk and you will not pay the medical bill when a sword accidentally punctures a foot. You can find examples of such ""Hold Harmless"" agreements on the web.
Each flyer should have detachable form with a place for the participant's name, phone, email, disclaimers and signature. Everyone should complete one, even if they sign-up on-line, they may complete it at registration.
Allow workshop participants to sign up and perform in the show. Keep this on a strict, first come, first served basis and put others on a waiting list. Have time limits. 15 performers will work out to be about a two hour show if a 6 minute maximum is set for soloists and 10 minutes for troupes.

, You can begin distributing flyers 6 months before your event. This will prevent dancers from planning other events on your date. If you plan to mail out flyers to your event, this should done about 6 weeks before, just like wedding invitations.

, They most likely have been doing this longer than you and can be a great help to you. Do not try to profit from the fee you charge them, but the number of people they can help you attract. Describe your event and let them make an offer to pay what they feel will be fair. Ask them for help advertising your event and provide them with your flyers. Starting with just one vendor is a good start. Once you advertise your event other vendors may contact you. Having only one from the start allows you to choose another who might offer something different. For smaller informal events, swaps work great.

, Use this number to create a list you will use at your registration table. The email should contain what the person has paid and what she has signed up for.

,, A list of performers is helpful for everyone even at the most informal event. You may include performer websites, some advertising, thank-yous and contact information. Include a dinner menu when appropriate.

, Be there to let them in.

,, They can't take the class until everyone has arrived.

,,,, Put sticky labels and sharpie markers in the box and tell performers to label their music with their name and track they wish to use. Index cards for a performer to write how she wishes to be introduced or to describe her dance are nice too. Use your program to put the music in order.

, Have some mood music playing.

, Introduce yourself and some teasers about the performers. Introduce important people & other teachers in the audience.

,,, End with some open dancing for everyone.

, Tuck them down towards the toe area. If you are worried about the bags leaking, place them into another bag before putting them inside the shoe.

, If you are disgusted by the idea of sticking your shoes into the freezer, stick your shoes into plastic bags first.

, As the water freezes, it will expand and stretch your shoes.

, If the bags are difficult to take out, let the ice melt a little. You can also try breaking the ice with a hammer.

, This will help them retain their shape, and ensure that they don't shrink while they warm back up.

This method is best for shoes that are just a little too snug.
Use caution for this method. If the soles are glued on, the heat from the hairdryer can cause the glue to weaken and the soles to peel away., Focus on the tight sections, such as the toes. The heat will help soften the material and make it more pliable., They will feel even more snug than before, but after you stretch them, they will feel just right.

, Give your toes a wiggle from time to time to help loosen them further. As the shoes cool down, they will retain the shape of your foot. This can take a while. Be patient, and don't take them off until they have completely cooled down.

, They should be a bit larger than before, and more comfortable to wear. If they are still too snug, repeat the whole process again."

Leave the stretcher on overnight.,
Loosen the stretcher and pull it out the next morning.,
Try the shoe on to see if it fits.",How to Stretch Tight Ballet Flats3," Depending on what your shoes are made out of, you will need to either dampen them or heat them up. This method will work for most materials, including synthetics. Keep in mind, however, that leather stretches more than synthetic materials, such as vinyl and fabric.Dampen leather or fabric shoes. Warm water is the easiest, but can stain or discolor the leather. A leather stretching solution would be safer, if you can find it.
Heat shoes made from vinyl or urethane with a hairdryer. Keep in mind that this can damage some vinyl or urethane surfaces.

, Don't worry if the stretcher appears too small. You want it to fit loosely inside the shoe. If you have bunions, consider popping in the bunion attachment into the shoe stretcher first.

, Keep turning until you see pressure on the surface of the shoe. Don't overstretch your shoe; three or four turns will do. You can always repeat the process again if the shoes are still too snug., While the shoes dry/cool down, they will keep that stretched shape.

, Turn the knobs counter-clockwise until the shoe stretcher returns to its original size. Pull the shoe stretcher out.

, If the shoe is still too snug, repeat the process again. Keep in mind that some materials, especially synthetics, may return to their original size over time. If that happens, simply re-stretch your shoes."

Wear the shoe out.,
Try dampening the shoes with rubbing alcohol and wearing them.,
Try using water and newspaper.,
Take your shoes to a shoe repair shop.",How to Stretch Tight Ballet Flats4," Most shoes will stretch out on their own, especially if they are made out of leather. If the shoe is just a little too snug and not painful to wear, consider wearing it around the house a few times. It will eventually loosen up and become more comfortable.


Keep in mind that this will only loosen the shoe in the toe area. It won't work to make the shoe longer.

, Spray the inside of the shoes with rubbing alcohol until they are damp.Place them onto your feet and wear them until they dry. The wet material will stretch to the shape of your foot, and it will keep that shape once it dries.


This method is best for stretching shoes in the toe area. It is not good for lengthening shoes.This method works best on shoes made from canvas, leather, and microfiber.
If you have very sensitive skin, consider diluting the rubbing alcohol with some water first. You can also use just plain water.
Consider doing a spot test first. Some materials do not react well with rubbing alcohol., Dampen the entire shoe with water, then pack the inside firmly with newspaper. Leave the shoes stuffed like this for 24 hours. Dampen them every four to eight hours, as needed. Let the shoes dry fully before you take the newspaper out and try them on.


If you are worried about the ink staining your shoe, you can use a paper bag or butcher paper instead.
You can also use olive oil, Goo Gone, or even petroleum jelly (Vaseline), but keep in mind that these may stain your shoe. Use the oil only once during the 24 hour period.

, A professional will use his or her tools and experience to stretch your shoes until they fit. Usually, shoe stretching costs between $10 and $25, but this also depends on the shoe cobbler's experience. Keep in mind that shoes can only be stretched so much—about half a size.

Gather your materials.,
Cut your tulle.,
Roll your tulle.,
Cut your tulle.,
Secure your elastic band.,
Make your first knot.,
Repeat until all of your tulle is used.,
Add your finishing touches.",How to Make a Ballet Tutu," For your homemade tutu, you’ll need approximately 2 meters (6.6 ft) of tulle, elastic for a waistband, a needle and thread, scissors, a measuring tape. You can also buy ribbon for a bow or gems to attach to your ballet tutu. If you want a tutu with extra body, you can create it with extra tulle strips.Rather than buying a large rectangle of tulle, consider buying a roll of tulle. Although they don’t come in precise length, it may save you money and will give you plenty of fabric—you’ll just have to measure and cut it.;
, Cut four pieces of tulle. They should be approximately 55 inches (140 cm) across and length of you final tutu doubled. Lay your pieces of tulle on top of one another.


If you have the measurements for you ballet dancer, use them and double the length. If not, there are some standard guideline sizes for a ballet tutu.Baby tutu: 12-14 inch strips
Toddler tutu: 24-26 inch strips
Adult tutu: 28-32 inch strips



, Take your long strip of tulle and roll it lengthwise so that it looks like a large hot dog. Use a large flat surface to roll your tulle. It will be much easier than trying to roll it while it’s hanging off of the side of a table. If necessary, use the floor as a space to lay it out and roll it., Take the roll of tulle and cut the end so that it is even. Next, cut your roll into three inch sections. You’ll end up with strips that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. They should be the double the length of your desired tutu., Stretch your elastic waistband around something to hold it in place. You can use a large book, the back of a chair, or anything else that will keep it tight without overstretching it.

, Take two pieces of tulle and fold them at their center point over your hand to make a loop. Put this loop under the top of the elastic. Pull the ends of the tulle over the elastic and through the loop. This will knot the tulle onto your elastic.Pull this knot firmly but not too tight. If you pull it too tight, it will stretch the elastic band and your finished tutu will be bigger than you want.

, Keep using these knots all the way around your elastic. Adjust your elastic as you go so that you’re always tying a knot from a comfortable position. If you go all the way around your elastic and have extra tulle, push the knots closer together and fit all the tulle on your tutu for a full, fluffy look.

, If you wish, now is the time for finishing touches on your ballet tutu. You can hot glue gems throughout your tulle, or add a bow to the front of it. As soon as these are attached, your tutu will be ready to wear. Simply slip it on over a leotard and it’s ballet ready.

Before your first class, bend your pointe shoe a bit at the arch.,
Break in the box (front part) of the shoes by gently pressing the top until it gives a little.,
For your first class, try to keep this kind of breaking-in minimal, just enough so that the shoes are wearable.,
All your sewing should be done with either pointe shoe thread, or dental floss.",How to Prepare Pointe Shoes for Dancing1," Don't bend the area between the arch and demi-pointe area; this will weaken the shoe's support. Do some releves from demi pointe to pointe. To soften them even more, put one shoe on, but leave the heel off and folded all the way down. Take hold of the heel of the shank (the hard ""sole"" of the shoe) and push it down and in to your exact arch. If you feel uncertain about this, ask a teacher to do it the first time. However, if you use only a little pressure, it will not hurt the shoe.

, This makes it wider and more comfortable for your toes. Do not use harsh pressure, or extreme methods such as hammering them, unless you are very experienced! This will likely cause the shoe to crack or break and be weak in areas. Some common ""pressure points"" for dancers en pointe are the bunion bone area (side of the big toe joint) and the tailors bunion (side of the pinky to joint). If you find those areas to rub or press to much, try dabbing a little rubbing alcohol on them, working them with your fingers, then allowing them to mould around your foot while drying.

, If you are not experienced you may end up damaging the shoes. The best way to break in shoes is by dancing in them. As you become more experienced, you will be able to figure out how to break in your shoes more easily.

, Dental floss is strong and will not give out as easily as regular thread.

Measure a thumbs length from the back seam of the shoe, both ways.,
Before you begin sewing, be sure to measure out the appropriate length of elastic by putting the shoe on and feeling for what is comfortable.,
Line up your elastic, and sew with a whipstitch and double back 2 or three times for maximum durability.

Sit down, and study your pointed foot.,
Fold the heel of the shoe over so it makes a crease.,
Fold the end of your ribbon twice.,
Adjust the ribbons until they are right for you.,
Sew them right below the drawstring.,
Double check and make sure that the ribbons work.

",How to Prepare Pointe Shoes for Dancing3," Notice where the middle of your arch is.

, Then, mark where it meets the side of the shoe, this is where you sew your ribbons on. Or, fold the heel of the pointe shoe as far forward as it'll go, and fit the end of the ribbon in slanted to follow the line of the fold. The fold should be in line with the approximate centre of the ribbon.

, Then place it shiny side outward, and sew around the edges. Make sure you do not pierce the satin on the outside of the shoe, only the rough canvas on the inside, to keep it looking nice and clean. Once you've done both ribbons Do a few releves or other basic ballet moves. Make sure that the ribbons support your ankle.

, You may need to angle them.

, Make sure that you do not sew the drawstring.

After the ribbons have been sewn, put your foot up on pointe.,
Holding the drawstrings still, go down to demi-pointe.,
Continue steps 1-2 until the sides don't bag much.,
Be careful if the drawstring is elastic, because it is easy to tighten them up too much.

,
After you have your drawstrings properly tightened, tie them in a double knot.

,
Pull the drawstrings up to the end of the toe and cut them there.,
Go onto demi-pointe in your shoes.,
For a first pair of shoes, it is wiser to wait to adjust the drawstrings until you have danced in them first.",How to Prepare Pointe Shoes for Dancing4," Gently pull the drawstring a little.

, The shoe should not bag much on the sides.

, A little bagging is okay; you don't want the drawstring to be too tight.

,,, This way you can still adjust them if needed, but they will be easily tucked in for a professional look!

, If there is pressure or pain in your achilles, either your drawstring is too tight, your ribbons are too tight, or the shoe is too short for you. Adjust your ribbons if you feel a pull on your Achilles tendon. Do not dance if the shoes cause pain in your Achilles tendon! This can lead to tendonitis and other injuries that could possibly ruin your career as a dancer.

, Ask your teacher if you can tie your drawstrings in bows for your first class. That way you can adjust the over the course of the class.

Gather your darning materials.,

Darn your other pointe shoe.,
Rethread the darning needle.,
Create lengthwise stitches across the platform.,
Connect the horizontal rows.,
Decide to keep or remove the satin on the shoe platform.,
Choose sturdy darning tools.,
Consider alternatives to darning.",How to Darn Pointe Shoes," To darn your pointe shoes you will need a few important materials. You will need:


Pointe shoesA large, thick sewing needle or curved needleWool or cotton embroidery thread (approximately two arms-length of thread)ScissorsA thimble (optional);
, You will need to thread approximately two arms-length or about three feet of thread.Insert your darning thread through the eye of the needle. You can use single threading to make your darning especially fine, but it is also acceptable to double up and knot the two thread ends together once you have thread the needle.Darning thread can be found at nearly any sewing or craft store.Cut the excess threading off from the end of the knot.

, Hold the pointe shoe with the sole of the shoe facing you, and the front of the shoe facing away from you.Insert the needle at the back of the pointe platform, near the top of the satin pleats. Pass the needle through the satin and through the platform material at an angle starting below, from the outer, side edge of the platform, and pushing it up diagonally, to the top, inner edge of the platform.Push the needle completely though the shoe, and pull the thread all the way until the threaded knot reaches the shoe., Insert the needle very close next to the stitching hole you just made. Again, pull the needle through the satin and platform material, and begin to pull the rest of the threading through. However, don't pull the thread tight, all the way through.The thread will be in a loop before you pull it all the way through the shoe. When you see the loop of thread, pass your needle through the loop, and then pull the thread taut.This will create your first chain stitch.

, Continue stitching around the platform of the shoe, inserting the needle through the satin and platform material and drawing the thread through the stitching loops, maintaining the chain stitch.Be sure to not make the stitchings too outward on the sides of the platform, or else the darning won’t provide any effective traction while dancing.


The spacing between the stitching isn’t too important, but they do need to be close together, and they do need to be relatively uniform., Once you have chain stitched all the way around the platform of the pointe shoe and have come back to where you started darning, cut off the excess thread. You can cut pretty close to the last knot you made, but leave about a centimeter of leftover thread. You don’t have to make a final knot; the darning thread will stay in place since all of the stitches consist of knots.Consider securing and sealing the last bit of excess thread by swiping it with a bit of clear nail polish. That will keep the thread sealed onto the shoe rather than hanging off freely., When you are finished darning one pointe shoe, repeat the same exact stitching method on your other shoe. You may find darning your second pointe shoe to be a bit easier and faster, now that you have one darned pointe shoe under your belt.

, Darning the entire pointe platform is optional, but some dancers like having their pointe platform darned in this way. Rethread the darning needle with a large amount of thread.Consider using a couple arms-length of thread. You can double up and knot the two end pieces of thread, or you can leave it as a single thread.


Remember, you rather have an excess amount of thread, than not have enough when you are in the middle of stitching.

, Starting at the top of the platform near one side of the shoe, stitch parallel, horizontal rows across the face of the platform. Create about five doubled rows of stitches across the platform. When your stitches near the bottom of the platform close to the pleated satin, create your last horizontal, doubled over stitch.After your last horizontal stitch, tie a simple overhand knot as close to the shoe as possible, and snip off the excess thread.

, Starting at the top of the horizontal rows, rethread your needle with more thread, and use the same chain stitching technique to connect two of the rows at a time. Just how you stitched around the platform, your chain stitches will move down the rows, to the other side of the platform face.When you get to the end of a horizontal row, continue to move down the rows, and connect them together. Eventually, you will connect all of the horizontal row stitches together, completely covering the face of the platform with darning., Some dancers remove the satin from the platform of the shoe (for even better grip along with the darning), but keeping or removing the satin is really based on your personal preference.If you decide to remove the satin from the platform of the shoe, use scissors and dig one of the blades in toward the side corners of the shoe platform, around the toe box.Once you insert the tip of the scissors into the slight spacing between the sides of the platform and the rest of the shoe, cut away the satin only on the top, flat platform of the shoe., For darning your pointe shoes, the darning thread should be beige, white, or pink, and should be a thick embroidery type of threading. Thick wool or cotton threading works really well. For the threading needle, use a thick needle with a large eyelet. You can also use a darning specific curved needle, but it’s all based on personal preference.The needle must be thick and heavy duty, or else it will bend and break as you try to push it through the pointe shoe platform.

, Since darning can be extremely tedious, some dancers mimic the stabilizing effects of darning by sewing crochet toe covers onto their pointe platforms, gluing suede patches onto their pointe platforms, or adding or moleskin sheets to their pointe platforms.All of these modification methods are less time consuming that darning, but can help pointe platforms last longer, while still providing a gripped surface for the pointe shoe.

Check with your artistic director, teacher or dance school policy before setting out to buy the shoes.,
Check the sizing chart.,
Try on a pair of soft ballet shoes that you (or the sales assistant) consider are your size.,
For larger feet, ballet shoes come with the elastic straps attached at only one end.,
Pull the drawstring.,
Purchase the shoes if they fit well after trying the above suggestions.,
Make adjustments if needed.",How to Fit Soft Ballet Shoes," You'll need to find out whether they prefer leather or canvas ballet shoes. It's also possible that the school requires a certain color, although soft pink is the standard color.


Do you want leather, canvas or satin shoes? Each has advantages and drawbacks and while the leather ones are likely to last the longest, all end up taking a beating from the dance work. Consider much care each shoe type requires, what your dance school recommends and your budget.;
, You can find sizing charts online, often on the website of the store you're purchasing from. It can be helpful to have checked there before going shopping. When in the ballet supplies store, they'll have a sizing chart for you to check and you can also ask the sales assistant for specific measuring help.


Usually ballet slippers will run one to three sizes smaller than the size of your street shoe. However, it varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, so it's recommended that you try on the shoes before deciding what your size is. The charts are an indicator, not the final word.
Buying online the first time is not recommended, unless it's a really good cheap deal on used shoes where you don't stand to lose much money if they're not suitable.

, Stand in your slippers and do a few pliés and some releves. If the shoes don't feel perfect when doing typical ballet movements, you will need to keep trying other pairs until you find the one that works.

, You must sew these yourself; this helps to fit the shoes to your foot.

There are two popular ways to sew on these elastics. One way is two have a single elastic straight across the top of your foot. Another is to have two elastics crossed over your foot.







, There is usually a drawstring to pull but don't pull it too tightly. There should not be any wrinkling of the shoe; the drawstring just neatens the look and forms to shape around your foot.

, You may get lucky, and no more adjustment to your shoe will be needed. But if the shoe fits generally but still needs some comfort shaping, proceed to the next step., If you feel your leather soft ballet shoes don't fit as well as you'd like them to, try this trick (do not' try this trick with satin or canvas shoes):

Fill a regular spray-bottle with rubbing alcohol, slightly diluted with water.
Whilst wearing your shoes, lightly spray them with the alcohol.
Start pressing all over the shoe with your hands, shaping them to your foot. Pay particular attention to the arch.
Do not take the shoes off until they are completely dry. When you do take them off, they will be better shaped to your foot.







"
"
Slide the pointe straight onto your foot.,
Stand up and check if your toes touch the end.,
Check if any toes are overlapping.,
Place one foot in the pointe position.,
Check that the shoe fits securely, if you feel any pressure tell the fitter, or if it feels too loose try to address this.

,
Pointe and flex your feet to ensure that the heel is not painfully tight.

,
You should JUST touch the end of the shoe.,
Make sure your foot is properly supported when you go ""up"" in the shoe.",How to Be Fitted in Pointe Shoes,";
, This may feel uncomfortable, but the shoe is required to fit just right in the length, to prevent blistering.

, If so, the pointe shoe is too narrow. If you can easily slip a finger underneath the drawstring, the shoe is too wide.

, There should be a small amount of fabric that you can pinch up at the heel(about 1/2 inch), although it should not be baggy.

,,, If you feel your toes pushing at the end, the shoe is too short. If your toes are just touching, that should be fine. Get in to first position and do a plie, if your toes still are not crushed against the end, but just touch, the length is probably fine.

, If your foot slides down in the shoe, it isn't fitting you properly. You should be able to feel the support from the box when en pointe. Most stores will have a barre for support when you try the shoe.

The break is where the heel becomes the arch. Bend your foot to see where your arch naturally breaks. You can mark the point on both your foot and the shoe with a marker.Avoid arbitrarily bending the shank of your pointe shoe, since this may not correspond to the natural break in your arch.;
, After you’ve identified your natural break and marked it in your shoe, pry up the shank and bend it back and forth gently at the marked position. This will make the shank more pliable when you rise up on pointe.


Remove the small nail that fastens the shank to your shoe., Put on the shoe and extend your foot from flat to demi pointe to begin molding the break. This will help you know the exact shape of your foot in your shoe.

, Remove the shoe and gently mold the area of the shank where your natural arch breaks. Work the area with your hands, following your mark and the shape your foot has made. Molding the shoe where your arch naturally breaks will make rising in your shoes more comfortable and increase the life of your shoes.


You don’t need to add heat to help with shaping the shank. Since you previously wore your shoe to begin molding the break, the heat from your foot will have been enough.There’s no designated left or right ballet shoe- your own feet will determine this as they break in the shoe. Label each shoe to make sure you’re consistently putting on your shoes until they are broken in enough to identify by sight., To soften the platform at the front of the shoe that supports the toes, gently step on it with the heel of your foot. Softening the box will increase the comfort of wearing pointe shoes.


While some professionals slam the box in a doorway, steer clear from this method. Softening it this way could break the box (or your fingers!) if not done correctly., Using your hands, massage the sides of the toe box to soften it. This will make the box more supple, allowing for a more comfortable dancing experience., If there are still some parts of the box that are giving you trouble, use a small amount of water or rubbing alcohol to help soften the area.Using too much water or rubbing alcohol can result in ruined shoes., After you have sewn the elastic and ribbons on your shoes, you can begin exercises to further break in your new pointe shoes. Rise onto demi pointe and walk around.Make sure you always use your pointe shoes on a proper studio floor so the shoes will last longer.
Take a break from walking around on demi pointe and occasionally arch your foot., Standing in first position bend one knee and rise to full pointe on your foot. Repeat this with both feet, rolling slowly back down., Heat and perspiration from your foot will continue to aid molding your shoe to your foot as you work at the barre. You can do plies or pony trots, making sure to work both feet equally. "

Starting from your feet, make sure you maintain your weight on your toes, as this is what gives you control when you are dancing.






Always, think of pulling up from the lower abdomen and keeping your chest open.






The chest is very important in tango because this is where the connection is made between the leader and the follower.





;
, Tango is an intense and passionate dance. Much of that emotion comes from the energy which flows between the dancers and creates that all important connection.


The energy should flow from the centre of the dancers, up through their arms and chest and from there permeate through to their partner, creating a strong link and route for communication. Newcomers to Tango may at first find this hard to achieve, but with more practice and appreciation for the dance the energy will begin to flow naturally.







, The movement of your feet in Tango is extremely important.


There should be as much contact with the floor as possible, so that the feet skim over it rather than being plodded or being placed.






However, skimming should not be confused with dragging which would make the steps heavy and very tiring.







, Close contact is very important in Tango and some people need a little time to get used to it.


The man should embrace the woman using the whole of his right forearm across the middle of her back, bringing her closer to him.






The lady holds his hand with her right hand and her left is placed on his shoulder.






It's a cliché, but it's true—Practice does make perfect. The more you do it, the more you will understand your movements and technique. You'll also become more confident with your actions too.

Throw on some merengue music.,
Take a Latin dance hold.,
Begin marching in place on the 1 beat.,
Men, don't forget to lead!,
Start traveling across the floor.,
Do 1-handed turns.,
Do 2-handed turns.,
Do the hammerlock turn.,
Do cuddle turns.",How to Do the Merengue," Fernando Villalona, Juan Luis Guerra, Eddy Herrera, and Toño Rosario are good places to start, though New York merengue has its own veritable following too (think Mala Fe, Henry Jimenez, and Aybar). You could also just find your favorite Internet radio and type in ""merengue"" and let it do the work for you!


However, merengue is totally versatile. Since it's a basic step that requires 4/4 time -- which most music is -- you can do this step to just about anything. Give it a try to your favorite artist!;
, This is a closed dance position. Here are the details:


Hold your arm out so it makes an L shape at shoulder level.
The man's left hand holds the lady's right hand.
The man puts his right hand on the lady's shoulder blade and the lady puts her left hand on the man's shoulder blade; their arms should touch (with a bit of pressure) with the man's arm below the lady's. There should be no gap between the two arms at any point.
Be close but not too close -- about a foot apart.

, Ladies start with their right foot, men on their left. March so that you take a step on every beat. 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.


Men: start on your left foot, marching in place, bending your knees slightly with each step. As you bend your knee and shift your weight, your hip should naturally fall. It is this hip movement that makes the merengue what is. You don't need an excessive hip shaking or gyrating -- just that natural hip movement that takes place when you shift weight.
Women: start on your right foot, bending your knees slightly, doing the same movement as your partner. Your knees are mirroring each other, but not touching (or, God forbid, ramming into each other). Feel your hips move back and forth, slightly up and down as you change weight with each beat.
Get into a rhythm with your partner. When you both start to feel the grove, feel free to move on to partner work (in other words, turns. The fun stuff!).

, Your partner should be able to close her eyes and know exactly what's happening. With each slight movement, you are cuing her where to go and what to do. It's the slight pressure from the arm you have around her that will do most of it -- don't yank her around!


At the same time, it's important not to give her false signals. If she feels you start to do something, she'll respond. So make sure you follow through!

, With this basic marching step (it's one heck of a sensual march), start moving back and forth, left and right. Men, take your partner slowly in a 360-degree turn. Don't rush the music or try to do some impressive double turn -- just take the full 8 beats (or even 16 if you're feeling groovy) to get around in a circle. The beauty of the merengue is in the slow, fluid movements.

, It's turning time! While still doing the basic step, here are the basics:


Slight out into an open position. This basically means that the woman slides her hand that's around the man down his arm and grabs his hand -- both sets of hands are clasped now.
Grab either the left or right hand and drop the other. The man should lift the hand he chooses into the air, indicating to the women how to turn.
Then, the woman (or man, but the man usually follows in succession) turns to the inside or the outside underneath her arm -- the man will indicate this by turning the woman's hand to the right or left.

Keep the basic step going the entire time! Turn at the same pace you're stepping -- a casual 1, 2, 3, 4.



, Slide out into the same open position you would for 1-handed turns, and, this time, lift both hands up into the air. From there:


The woman goes under both arms in a 360-degree turn. As a result, her arms are now crossed. To get out of this, you have two options:
The man can turn her back the opposite direction, just repeating the same move back the way she came.
The man can turn himself, uncrossing the arms as a result, returning to a normal, open stance.

, For this one, start the same as the 1-handed turn; that is, raise one hand up in the air but don't drop the other. Turn her to the outside -- as a result, she now has one of her arms wrapped around her back, one arm out, and is positioned at the man's side. The man's hand is resting on the woman's hip.


If you'd like, keep that momentum and turn in a slow, 360-degree circle. Then, unwind the woman by taking her free hand (the one not wrapped around her), and spin her back the other direction, resuming a normal stance.
Men, to make sure the woman takes a full turn, place your thumb on her hip and make her face you. It's just a slight repositioning of angles.

, This is the same as the hammerlock turn, only the lady turns to the inside. Because of this, both her arms get wrapped around her and she stands directly in front of the man (as opposed to at his side, like in the hammerlock). But then the man should move her to his side, both her arms still wrapped in front of her. You should now be standing hip to hip, facing the same direction.


Then, take that momentum and move around in a circle, the woman moving in a larger circle backward.
If you'd like, take the hand that's on her hip and push her to the other side of you. Then circle again!

A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one’s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first.
The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.;
, It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot., Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.

, It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.

, As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you’ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it’s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward., It probably won’t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you’ll be ready to start mixing things up."

, Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again., This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body.Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle.
The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.

, One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move.Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now.
Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #*Repeat this move a few times.

, This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out.


Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later.
If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick., Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again., This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand."

This is the Basic pattern, also known as a Side Basic or Chasse Basic or Close Basic.,
Rock step forward with your left foot.,
Chasse to the left, aka cha-cha-cha to the left.,
Rock step backward with the right foot.,
Chasse to the right.,
Repeat from ""rock step forward with the left"".",How to Do the Cha Cha," It is described here from the leader's perspective (the follower's part is nearly identical; the most obvious difference is that she will take a backward rock when the leader takes a forward rock and vice versa). Note that other cha-cha patterns will replace some or all elements of the Basic with fancier elements. The Basic cha-cha pattern is counted 2-3-cha-cha-cha, or 2-3-4&1 if you know how to Count Music.;
, A ""rock step"" means take one step (in this case a step forward), completely putting your weight on the foot (in this case, your left foot), but WITHOUT picking up or moving the trailing foot, then shifting your weight back completely onto that other foot (in this case the right foot). More detailed breakdown:


Small forward step with the left foot on the TWO beat of the music.
Rock (i.e. shift weight) back onto the right foot on the THREE beat.

, A ""chasse"" means you take a step, then bring your feet together and put your weight on the foot you just moved, then take a third step with the original foot. So it's like: step, together, step - as if one foot were chasing the other and catching up on every other step. Note that ""together"" means that you can actually feel your feet physically touching. In this case, our chasse is to the left, so it consists of three fast steps taken to the leader's left in two beats of music. Breakdown:


Take a tiny step to the left with your left foot on the FOUR beat of the music. (This is the first ""cha"" in ""cha-cha-cha"").
Bring your right foot together with your left foot and shift your weight onto the right foot; do this on the half-beat between four and one. (This is the second ""cha"").
Take a step to the left with your left foot on the ONE beat of the music. This is the third and final ""cha"" in ""cha-cha-cha"". It can be a slightly larger step than the previous steps, visually reflecting the emphasis on the 1 beat you hear in the music, though this is not a hard and fast rule.

, This is like the forward rock step, except going back, and with the opposite foot. Detailed description:


Small step backward on the right foot, on the TWO beat of the music. As with the rock step forward, put your weight completely on this foot, but don't actually pick the other foot up off the floor (the left heel can come up, but don't actually move the left foot back or lift it into the air).
Rock (i.e. shift weight) forward onto the left foot on the THREE beat.

, It's much like the chasse to the left, only it's to the right instead.


Tiny step to the right with the right foot, on the FOUR beat.
Bring your left foot together (that means feet touching each other) to your right foot, and put your weight onto the left foot. This happens on the half-beat between four and one.
Step to the right on the ONE beat of the music.

, At this point, your left foot is hopefully free and able to carry out that forward rock step, after which you chasse to the left again, etc.

Your feet will stop at the corner points on the box and move along the edges and diagonally across the center. Envisioning this shape will help you as you learn the dance.;
, The waltz is known for its three beat count. As you step, you should be able to count 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc. Two 3-counts should complete your box.

, You can dance the basic square movement, especially in the beginning when you are learning the dance. However, it is more common for the waltz to include turns. These are easily added once you are more accustomed to the dance.

, The dance is, of course, a partnered dance so you will have to dance with at least one other person once you have practiced a little. However, you can dance as a single couple or around several other couples. It is important when dancing with other couples, to observe how they are dancing. If turns are added to the dance, you will also need to move with the rest in order to avoid running into them.

Your body weight should be a little forward on the middle of your feet (between the heel and ball of your foot). , The closed position is the basic ballroom dance position. Traditionally ballroom dancing is a man and a woman, but you can dance with whoever you want. The woman and the man stand facing each other and are slightly offset to the left. The man puts his left hand in the woman’s right hand. The man puts his right hand on the woman’s back while the woman puts her left hand on the man’s upper arm. , You will know if everyone is dancing waltz if you can identify strong sets of six in the music when you count along to the song playing. The box step is the most common waltz step. Once you know this you can at least pretend like you know what you are doing. The goal of the box step is to make a box with you and your partner's feet.


The leader (traditionally the man): Left foot forward, right foot side, left foot close, right foot back, left foot side, right foot close
The follower (traditionally the woman): Right foot back, left food side, right food close, left food forward, right foot side, left food close , If you are dancing in sets of eight, instead of six like the waltz, you can do the basic side step. Step to the left with your left food. Move your right foot to the left and bring it together with your left foot. Then move your left foot further to the left and bring your right foot towards it again and touch. The pattern is side-together-side-touch. Then repeat moving your feet toward the right. , It seems silly, but you can’t fake ballroom dancing ability if you don’t even show up.

Going onto the dance floor is also going to take some courage, but just remember that it is just dancing and that you can do it. , You will look worse if you look uncomfortable and embarrassed that you cannot dance. Don’t worry about the mistakes you will make. Act like you know what you are doing and people will think that you do. Try to relax. It might be hard to relax when you are just a beginner but you will look stiff and awkward if you have tension. Make eye contact and talk to your partner.

No matter your reason for faking your dancing ability, it will help if your partner is someone you are comfortable with. Choose a partner who you know well and feel comfortable messing up in front of.


If your partner is a good dancer, you can just follow what they do. If they are the leader this is especially easy. Just relax and follow their lead and you will look like you know what you are doing too.
If you and your partner both don’t know how to dance and want to pretend like you do, just relax and try to help each other. Keep things simple and go along with whatever mistakes happen.

, Look and see what the people around you are doing and copy them. This will help you find a rhythm and pick up on other people’s moves. Just look like you know what you are doing and give a new move a try. , Don’t tug on your partner too hard, especially if you are the leader.

Count as you listen to the song. If you count out the beats in the music, you will be able to find the Salsa beat and identify which steps go with which beat. If you can't keep count while you're listening to the song, it's best to choose a different one.

4/4 time is counted in 8-counts. You'll be doing one standard Salsa step in 8 beats.

Lead your partner.,
Learn the ""On 1"" style of Salsa dancing.,
Learn the ""On 2"" Puerto Rican style of salsa dancing.",How to Dance Salsa2," The leader in the dance should guide the follower by giving little tugs or pushes that let the follower know when to turn, hesitate, dip, or perform other moves.









The lead should be a gentle push with the man's hand on the woman's hand, shoulder or waist.

, This is named such because your initial movement is, believe it or not, on 1. You'll be moving on 1, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 7. 4 and 8 are held. If you're watching a tutorial, you may hear the instructor use only these 6 beats, or just call out 1 and 5. Here are the basic moves:









Start with both of your feet together
On the first beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the second beat, rock back on your right foot.
On the third beat, step back with your left foot, placing the weight on the ball of your foot.
On the fourth beat, place your weight toward the heel of your foot (you do not pick it up and move it). Apart from a slight shift in weight, the fourth beat is held.
On the fifth beat, step back with your right foot.
On the sixth beat, rock forward on your left foot.
On the seventh beat, step forward with your right foot, placing the weight on the ball of your foot.
On the eight beat, spread out your weight evenly on your right foot, but not lifting it up.

Think in terms of fast, fast, slow. 1 and 2 are fast, 3 is slow (because 4 is held). The same goes for 5 through 8. 1, 2, 3 is left, right, left and 5, 6, 7, is right, left, right. That's it!



, It's the same as ""On 1,"" except for on 2. Ha. Use the following basic steps to dance the Salsa with your partner:








Start with both of your feet together
Hold the beat on the first beat and do not move.
On the second beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the third beat, rock back on your right foot.
On the fourth beat, step back with your left foot.
On the fifth beat, hold the beat and do not take any steps (but do even out your weight).
On the sixth beat, step back with your right foot.
On the seventh beat, rock forward on your left foot.
On the eighth beat, step forward with your right foot.

With this beat, you'll be moving (and hearing) 2, 3, 4 and 6, 7, 8. 1 and 5 are held (silent). Repeat these steps to the rhythm, since Salsa music uses 4/4 time and contains eight beats.

Move when the leader tells you to.,
Learn the ""On 1"" step.,
Learn the ""On 2"" step.",How to Dance Salsa3," As the follower, you must be attuned to what the leader is directing you to do. Pay attention to all the leads that your partner gives you and move instinctively in the direction that he is pushing you in.









Do not lead or pull your dance partner around. As the follower, you should wait for his lead and follow in line with the dance.

, This is the traditional Salsa step and mirrors the leader's moves described above. Use the following basic steps to dance the Salsa with your partner:








Start with both of your feet together.
On the first beat, step back with your right foot.
On the second beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the third beat, step forward with your right, starting with the ball of your foot.
On the fourth beat, hold the beat, transfer the weight to your heel, and do not take any steps.
On the fifth beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the sixth beat, step back with your right foot.
On the seventh beat, step to distribute your weight back onto the ball of your left foot.
On the eighth beat, hold the beat and do not take any steps, but distribute your weight onto your heel.

, For music that pops on the even counts, you may want to learn the ""On 2"" step, too. It's the same as the ""On 1"" variety, but on 2. It goes like this:









Start with both of your feet together.
Hold the first beat.
On the second beat, step back with your right foot.
On the third beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the fourth beat, step forward with your right, starting with the heel of your foot.
On the fifth beat, hold the beat, transfer the weight to your ball, and do not take any steps.
On the sixth beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the seventh beat, step back with your right foot.
On the eighth beat, step to distribute your weight back onto the ball of your left foot.

Again, think in terms of fast, fast, slow. For this one, 2, 3, 4 is right, left, right and 6, 7, 8 is left, right, left. Fast, fast slow -- right, left, right. Fast, fast, slow -- left, right, left.

Do a turn by yourself.,
Learn turns for partner dancing.,
Do a turn to the left.,
Work on the cross body lead.,
Learn the open break.",How to Dance Salsa4," Often, Salsa is peppy and can be danced in a club. While you may be dancing with someone technically, they are not holding you or you are not holding them. If that's the case, do a solo turn.









Let's say we're doing the ""On 1"" style of Salsa dancing. For both men and women (there is no ""lead"" when you're dancing solo):
On the first beat, step forward with your left foot.
On the second beat, turn around (180 degrees), moving your weight to the ball of your right foot.
On the third beat, turn to face your original direction (completing the circle), bringing your feet together.
On the fourth beat, hold.
Beats five through 8 are a normal ""On 1"" step.

This can double as a leader's turn to the right, if with a partner.



, For an underarm turn to the right, have the leader only hold his partner's right hand. He should raise it to head height on 3, creating a ""J"" in the air (swings out on 2). That's his only job. For the follower (presuming an ""On 1"" beat):









Beats 1-5 are as normal.
With your left foot brought forward on 5, turn to the right on 6.
Bring your left foot to your right foot on 7.
Hold 8.

, For the man, all you have to do is take the woman's right arm and move it to her left, cuing her to turn left. She will turn on 7. For the women (or the follower):









Beats 1-6 are as normal.
With your right foot forward on six, turn 180 degrees to your left (in other words, turn around) on 7. Your right heel should be up, with most of your weight on your left.
Hold 8. You will be facing backwards.
On 1, complete the turn, bringing your right behind your left. This is your natural 1 position.

, If you're bored with moving back and forth and back and forth, the cross body lead can get you to different parts of the dance floor.









For the leader, back away from your partner to the right on 5 (presuming an ""On 1"" step), allowing her to cross in front of you (hence the name). You would normally just step back -- with a cross body lead, step back and to the right. All other steps are as normal.
For the follower, step forward on 6. Your left goes forward on 5 as normal. Then, instead of bringing your right back on 6, step forward. Then on 7, bring your left to meet it, resuming the step and holding on 8.

, This is the move where the woman comes in front of the man (not facing him) and they trade spots. Here's the footwork for the two parts:









For the leader:

Step with your left foot back on 1. You both will be going back.
Cross over with your right on 2.
Bring your left to a natural position on 3. At this point, the woman should be in front of you (not facing you).
Cross behind you're left with your right foot on 5.
Bring your left next to your right on 6.
Step with your right in place on 7. Resume a normal step.


For the follower:

Step with your right foot back on 1. This is normal.
Step forward with your left on 2. This is also normal.
Step forward with your right on 3, turning 90 degrees to the left. The lead will behind you.
Cross behind your right with your left foot on 5.
Pick up your right and set it back down on 6. You don't need to move it very much.
Bring your left to your right on 7. Hold 8.

Find schools and studios in your area online to see what information about ballroom dancing they offer on their websites.
Visit schools and studios in your area in person to get informational brochures about ballroom dancing (in addition to their rates, etc.—see Part Three).

, If you know anyone or meet anyone who is a ballroom dancer—amateur or professional—you can learn about ballroom dancing from them as well. You can also seek out dancers by attending competitions and/or performances. You might also see if you can speak directly to the dancers who serve as instructors at schools or studios.


Ask dancers questions you have about ballroom dancing.
Let dancers know what you are confused or unsure about.

, This is an important decision, as it determines how you will proceed once you begin taking lessons. Make this decision based on how seriously you intend to take ballroom dancing.


Consider amateur ballroom dancing. Amateur ballroom dancers dance primarily to meet other people and socialize. Amateurs might even compete with others in amateur contests, which sometimes even have prizes.
Consider professional ballroom dancing. Professional ballroom dancers dance to make money. These dancers might be instructors at ballroom dance schools or studios or they may compete with other professionals at professional-level competitions to make money.

, You may decide that you want to pursue ballroom dancing primarily for its health benefits as a means of exercise. If this is what attracts you to ballroom dancing, consider some of the benefits of ballroom dancing for exercise. These benefits can help you to decide what you want to emphasize in your training regimen, which can help you decide which style of ballroom dancing you want to pursue. The health benefits of ballroom dancing for exercise include:


Improvement of aerobic power
Increased lower body endurance
Increased strength and flexibility

, Ballroom dancing has been used therapeutically for the elderly to improve their well-being. The therapeutic benefits of ballroom dancing, however, are not limited to the elderly.

DepressionRelationship issues
Bodily injury recovery

, Once you have learned about ballroom dancing and determined your goals, you will need to choose a school or studio that's right for you and begin lessons.


Make a list of schools based on your ballroom dancing goals. Determine the emphasis the schools you consider place on the different types of goals you may have for dancing.
Narrow down potential schools or studios you are considering. If you want to dance as an amateur, for instance, eliminate professional or exercise schools or studios from your list, and so on.

, After speaking to the instructors and staff, determine whether the school or studio seems like a good fit to you. Some schools or studios may offer a free first lesson to let you get a feel for the school before you purchase lessons.


Decide whether your personality jibes with the staff and/or instructors.
Think about your own learning style and decide whether the school or studio you visit teaches accordingly.

, Having narrowed your list of potential schools, choose the one that seems like the best fit for your goals, personality, and learning style. Although this is the final step to this part of becoming a ballroom dancer, its importance cannot be stressed enough; your choice of school might affect your determination.

, Ballroom dancing is a category of partner dances, so you will need a partner.


For best results, choose a partner who is easy for you to work with. Because you will have to practice a lot to improve your ballroom dancing skill, you will want to find someone with whom you can practice often and for long periods of time.

, Once you have found a partner, all that's left to do is begin lessons and practice.


Ballroom dancing lessons begin simply, with a single dance style—you will count out the beats to a song and move in a specific way (according to the instructor's choreography) as you count. You may not actually dance to any music at first because you will have to learn the steps and/or movements at a slower pace than the speed at which the music is played.
The speed at which you perform the steps for the dance will increase as you become more confident, and the instructor will likely add the music in when you have mastered the movements at a speed that will coincide with a chosen song.
This process repeats as you add in other styles. If you are learning according to the American Style syllabus of ballroom dancing, you will learn a specific set of ballroom dance styles, whereas if you are learning according to the International Style syllabus, additional dances will be involved.

, Once you have mastered the basic steps in the dances that make up the syllabus your school uses, you will want to refine your steps and movements with your instructor.


Your instructor may want to watch you dance to find areas where your movements can be improved. Dance in a way that is comfortable for you and listen to the feedback the instructor gives.
Use the instructor's feedback to improve your dancing with practice. Often, the feedback you will receive will amount to a simple missed step or unnecessary extra movement. Focus on the issue(s) that the instructor points out as you practice and try to overcome whatever issues you are having.

,


Be sure to attend lessons in accordance with the schedule you create with the school. Your lessons will help you find ways to improve in addition to learning new styles and techniques. Try not to skip lessons if you can help it, because doing so will ensure you are getting the most out of them; skipping lessons may cause you to fall behind.
Practice as often as you can. Outside of lessons, practice as much as possible with partners. Some schools offer times when you can come and practice with other students in an open timeframe with no structured lessons. You should take advantage of such opportunities and find other opportunities for practice as well, such as local clubs and organizations dedicated to ballroom dancing.
Be sure to practice according to your goals for ballroom dancing (see Part 2).
Consider participating in ballroom dancing competitions. Competition is also great practice, and, while it is certainly not a requirement to becoming a ballroom dancer, you may get great joy from competing. In fact, competition may fuel your passion for learning in numerous ways.

Go out and dance!",How to Ballroom Dance," Figure out which styles you are drawn to. While you don't need to learn all of them, you will need to learn a few core styles at first.


There are a variety of styles of ballroom dance, generally divided into standard and latin styles. Standard styles include Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz, and Quickstep. Latin styles include Cha-Cha, Rumba, Samba, Paso Doble, and Jive.While these styles may vary a bit, especially between American and International styles, the foundation of each is a very specific and distinct sequence of steps.
Complicated dances such as the bolero and paso doble can be picked up later, but if you want to go out dancing and not be stuck in a chair the whole night, you'll need to learn the basic steps such as the Rumba, Cha-Cha, Tango, Waltz, and Fox Trot.;
, Do you want to do social dancing or do you want to compete? Do you want to go out each weekend or do you just need to look good at a wedding? A specific type of event might require that you learn only one style. You'll be better prepared for a night of casual social dancing if you learn basic steps for a number of dance styles. Whatever your goals, remember them when moving forward!

, You might try the phone directory or a quick Google search for your area. Contact one or more of the schools and talk to them about your goals and if they can help you fulfill them.


Know what you want and that your needs match your instructors' expertise and methods. Talking to the other students and seeing how long they've been at the studio or visiting one or more dance classes may give you a good idea if it is a match. Some schools, for example, specialize in competitive dancing, while others focus on helping first-time dancers gain the experience (and courage!) to brave the ballroom dance floor at their next wedding invitation.
If you live near a college campus, take a look at their student clubs and activities. Many have ballroom dance classes that are open to non-student members.

, If you are nervous going to your first class with absolutely no knowledge of ballroom dancing, you may want to practice a bit with the help of websites or videos online. Start by learning the box step, the foundation step of many ballroom dances.


When doing the box step you are moving your feet in a square. Start with your feet together with your weight on your right foot. Move your left leg straight forward in a small step and shift your weight onto that foot. Next step your right foot up but to the side of your left foot, so that there is a gap of about a foot between your feet. Finish this first sequence by shifting your weight onto your right foot and bringing your feet together by moving your left foot over to meet your right. Now you will do this sequence again, only backwards. Shift your weight to your left foot and move your right foot straight back in a small step. Shift your weight and move your left foot back but to the side. Finish the box step by moving your right foot over to meet your left.
If you are having trouble, remember that it is always the outside leg that moves around the square you are making., There are many articles on the internet that can give you the basic sequence of steps and body movements of other ballroom steps including: How to do the Rumba, How to do the Cha-Cha, How to Samba, How to Dance the Tango, and How to Dance the Waltz.


These videos and online content cannot necessarily replace the benefits of going to a class. A dance teacher will be able to give you individualized instruction that is key to improving your dance skills.

, While you may have some basic knowledge of ballroom dance steps, classes will help you with all the other important aspects that make up a dance, including posture, communication, and dance etiquette. Some classes require that you come with a partner but many are designed for people without a specific partner.


Be sure to check the prices, as they will vary. You will want to be sure the school and your teacher are worth what you're paying. Many dance studios will offer potential students a free or low-cost initial lesson that will allow you to more easily find a good match between the studio and your goals. Group classes will generally be less expensive than private lessons, while the best specialized and personalized coaching for competitive ballroom dance can be a hundred times more expensive., Ask your teacher for a list of songs in the rhythm you're working on. Buy them and listen to them in the background. You might also find some musical collections selected specifically for a particular dance.


Pick out the dance rhythm and count it aloud as the music plays. Many beginning dancers benefit from first clapping the beat with the music. Yet also as you listen, visualize the dancers moving to the music. Feel the style of the dance, in addition to its rhythm.

, Most studios have practice sessions outside of lessons but you can also just practice on your own. Don't be afraid to ask more experienced dancers for help.

, Perhaps you have a friend that would like to learn how to ballroom dance as well. Maybe you can convince your partner to join you in the adventure of learning to dance.


It is a fact of life that people come in all shapes and sizes. Adjust your position and your dancing style to accommodate your partner, especially if height differences or body size might otherwise cause uncomfortable body contact. Remember that ballroom dancing is about grace, polish and courtesy.
Dance at the level of your partner. Don't try to do all your advanced new moves with someone who's just starting out. Ballroom dancing should be enjoyable for everyone involved. There is no point in trying to make yourself look good by making your partner look bad. When a couple works together, dance is a thing of beauty.
The secret to dancing together, as opposed to dancing near one another, is communication. This communication isn't conveyed through some special code, but is rather accomplished through the subtle body movements that can easily be detected when both dancers are standing upright, with good posture.

, You're in this to learn how to dance, so go dancing. Even after your first lesson feel free to go out dancing in public. If you have learned two moves at that lesson just use those. That's enough to go dancing and have a great time on the dance floor.


Ask everyone to dance! Beginners and experienced dancers will both help you to improve your dancing. Beginners make you check what you know. Experienced dancers will correct you. As a rule, ballroom dancers don't say no when you ask them to dance.
If someone asks you to dance, say yes! Remember that not only is it rude to say no, you also shouldn't miss out on a chance to polish your skills, no matter who asks.
Remember that ballroom etiquette precludes dancing more than two dances in a row with the same person. If you only want to dance with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you can stay home and dance in your living room.

Ask someone to dance.,
Escort your partner to the dance floor smoothly.",How to Slow Dance1," Do not just assume your partner wants to slow dance. (Unless maybe you are the bride and groom at a wedding.) He or she might want to take a break, or otherwise leave the dance floor. If you're a man who brought a date, you can give her your hand with a flourish and say,""Shall we?"" If you're a girl who brought a date, then gently take your partner by the hand and pull him up as you ask him to dance. Even if you don't have a partner, you should still look the person in the eyes when you ask him or her to dance, and even give him or her a playful smile or grin.









Don't worry if you're nervous -- it's likely that the person is nervous, too. Hide your nervousness by smiling and asking with confidence.;
, Once your partner has accepted your tempting proposition, then you should escort him or her to the dance floor slowly or smoothly -- there's no need to rush. Remember to ""savor"" the moment. If you know the person well or are dating, you can hold hands or link elbows as you head to the dance floor. The male should lead the way to the floor and on the floor, so the guy should clasp his partner's right hand with his left, lift it slightly, and guide the girl to the floor.









Girls, if your partner doesn’t automatically guide you onto the floor, give him your right hand or crook your elbow into his and walk onto the floor.
If you're already on the dance floor, the key is to keep yourself and your partner on the dance floor--no easy task if one or both of you is nervous about slow dances. If your partner is nervous, smile and tell him or her that there's nothing to worry about.

Position your feet.,
Master the motions.,
Lead (for guys).,
Be led (for girls).,
Move to the beat.,
Talk to your partner.",How to Slow Dance2," Correct arm position is vital for starting to slow dance properly. For the traditional slow dance position, the man should put his right hand on his partner's left hip side or on his partner's mid to upper back, and his left hand should gently grasp his partner's right hand and hold it up at about shoulder-level of the taller partner so that both partners' arms are bent upward from the elbow. You should stand about a foot to half a foot (30 - 15 cm) away from your partner, depending on the level of intimacy you want to create.









The woman's left arm will generally be placed on her partner's shoulder. This is a traditional ballroom dancing position (as well as a safe junior high dancing position), and you should still be standing about a foot from your partner.
If the two of you are in a romantic relationship, you can even get into a hug stance with the guy’s arms around the girl’s waist and the girl’s arms around the guy’s shoulders. This is also just a more common move for middle-school and even high-school dances because it's a bit easier to get into this position -- but it does make it a bit trickier for the guy to lead.
Don't let your hands wander. Even in the event that your partner doesn't mind, it’s distracting for the other dancers and just not classy.

, Face your partner, standing so that your head is about a foot or two away from his or hers. Standing toe-to-toe is not the optimal position -- you need to give yourself room to move your feet without bumping into your partner's feet. Some couples stand offset, with each person's right foot inside the other persons pair; some partners may have the woman's feet to the inside of the man's.









Your feet should be at least 1 foot (0.3 m) to 1.5 feet (0.5 m) apart (30 cm-45 cm) so that you can move comfortably from side to side.

, Luckily for you non-dancers, slow dancing is about as easy as it gets. Movements should be slow and smooth, and you need not move very much. (Swaying back and forth as you move in a circle is perfectly acceptable.) Simply transferring your weight back and forth, however, is a language everyone speaks. To vary, move or rotate, slightly lift the foot your weight is not on and slide that foot a little forward, back, or sideways.









As you improve your slow dancing skills, you can master the ""step touch"": simply step to the right with your right foot, then follow the foot with your left, touch the ground, and then step to the left with your left foot, and then follow your left foot with your right, touching the floor again before you move it back.
You and your partner's feet should be in sync when you do the ""step touch,"" or even when you sway your feet.
Your arms should stay in place, except when the guy tugs the girls hand to lead her in a new direction.
If you're close to the person you're dancing with, you can face each other directly, making your faces just a few inches apart. If not, you can move your head slightly to the left as your partner moves his to the right, or vice versa, so you're not facing each other head-on.

, Traditionally, the man leads the dance and the woman follows his movement. This means that not only should the man give cues that the couple should turn or move to a new position, but that the girl should allow herself to be led. If you're a guy, then you should guide your partner, not move her around on the dance floor like a broom. You should be confident enough in your movements to show the girl when you want to turn or move in a new direction. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you lead the girl:









The easiest way to lead the girl this is by subtly pushing or pulling her right hand (assuming you are holding it in your left hand) in the direction you want to go.
However, make sure you’re not doing all your leading with just your hands; if your body’s doing one thing and your arms are doing another, you’ll come across as pushy or like you don’t know what you’re doing.
Instead, lead with your whole body: keep your shoulders and elbows firm but springy and then step in the direction that you want to lead your partner.
You can lead your partner in a new direction, and continue to turn in a box-like shape so that you keep slow dancing while keeping things interesting as you move your bodies.
You can also just move your partner to the right, left, or back or forward if you want to find a less crowded place on the dance floor or if you just want to mix things up.

, Though you girls may not want to cede control to your dance partner, you have to trust him and hope that he'll do his best. If you try to control him while he tries to control you, then you'll end up in an awkward tug-of-war situation and neither of you will be able to really move or enjoy the dance. Here are some things to keep in mind as you allow yourself to be led:









If you’re lucky enough to get a partner who leads – even if awkwardly – don’t fight it. In fact, do your best to follow along; the clearer you make it that he’s in charge, the likelier he is to try to lead better.
If your partner moves his foot, you will need to compliment his action: as the leader moves his right foot backward, for example, you should move your left foot forward.

, Your steps should move roughly in time to the beat of the music so that you make a step every beat or so. This is not as hard as it might sound since the music will be nice and slow and easy to follow. If the song speeds up at some point, then speed up the ""step touch"" or swaying movements of your feet to match the music -- make sure that you and your partner and speeding up and slowing down when it's necessary.









If the music suddenly slows down, or if you're just feeling playful, guys, then you can turn your partner in the middle of the dance.

, For most of us, a slow dance is more about being close to your partner and getting to know each other than it is about moving. Feel free to talk to your partner, to look into his or her eyes and, if the situation is appropriate, to steal a kiss or two. Talking to your partner will put both of you more at ease during the dancing process, whether you know each other well or not.









Don't feel the need to talk constantly -- this can disrupt the flow of the dance and may make things awkward if you can't hear each other very well. Just a bit of conversation here and there will make the experience more fun and comfortable.

"
"
Thank your partner for the dance.,
Continue to the next dance or retreat gracefully.",How to Slow Dance3," Whether you're dancing with your wife of 60 years or someone you've never met before, thank your partner. You can just say, ""Thank you for the dance,"" or ""I hope we can do that again soon, thank you,"" to make your partner feel special. If you're a guy and are feeling playful, you can even give the girl a little bow as you thank her to make her feel special and show how much fun you had.









If you end the dance in this sophisticated manner, then the person will be more likely to dance with you in the future.

, Once you're comfortable with slow dances, you might not want to flee the floor as quickly as possible: one dance is just the beginning. If, however, you've had enough dancing for the moment, retreat from the dance floor. And if you haven't had the best time slow dancing with the person, taking a break is a good way to keep that person at bay.









Offer to escort your partner to his or her table or wherever he or she wants to go, or ask him or her if they would like to retreat if you want to do so.
If you enjoyed the slow dance and the music speeds up, don't be afraid. You can continue to dance to faster-paced music with the same dance partner, as long as you're both in the mood for more dancing.

Warm up every muscle in your legs.,
Start off with going through all five positions.,
Do this after a Port de bras, which means ""carriage of the arms"".,
Try to go as far as you can, and make sure your head faces your belly-button.,
Put your arm to the side, part your feet to second position, and repeat.

,
Repeat these for all positions, except when you come up from the port de bras on fifth position, go on relevé, which is on the ball of your foot, what people call, ""on your tippy toes"".

,
Now move on to stretching your leg.,
Finish with plié relevés!,
These are the basics of warming up.",How to Warm up for Ballet," Warming up is going to take about twenty minutes.If you don't stretch you could pull a muscle. Warming up for dance class is one of the most important parts of the process.


OPTIONAL: Put on some classical ballet music to do the warm-up.;
, In first positions, which is where your legs are together and they are turned out, have your hand on the barre, and do a demi-plié, and then go back up. Then another demi, and then a full grande plié, going all the way down, and back up.

, Your arm either to the side or above you, go slowly down to floor, bending your back.

, Make sure as you come up, your arm and head are aligned.

,,, First do coupé, then possé, the put your leg on the barre, and just bend your back and stretch your leg. Remember to point your foot on the barre. Plié your leg that is on the ground. Stay for 16 counts or seconds(same thing).


Rond de jambes, which is your toe on the floor, moving either on the outside of your body or the inside. Do some slow rond de jambes, then quick ones. As you end your rond de jambe, feel free to put a few battements here and there.

, 16 in first position, 16 on the right leg with your left leg behind it in coupé, the same except on your left.

, As you grow into it, feel free to add more to your warm-up and stretches.

Step one is to start at the barre.,
In center, it is best to start simple.,
A good place to start with stretching is positions like the butterfly stretch and reaching for the toes while sitting or standing.,
Across the floor should be more about fun the first few times.,
Music should be chosen appropriately.",How to Teach Beginning Ballet Classes," The best thing to do is just start with 1st, 2nd and maybe third position for plies. Make sure to do both sides so the students get used to the idea of turning around and doing the opposite side. After plies, it is best to stick with tendus from first for awhile and eventually progress to doing them from third. If the class still needs to be easier, skip tendu to the back and do it just to the front and side. Practice releves in the same positions as plies. If wanted add in passes without releve and add in releve when the students are ready. For passes be sure to teach couppe as an important part of getting to passe. After plies, tendus, releves and passes the students should be ready to come off the barre. Be sure to add in some balances at the barre in any of these combinations positions.
, Tendus in center should be basic. A few ways to keep it basic is not add arms or to stay facing en face the whole time. Balances can be tried in center once the students have shown progress with them at the barre. Jumps in center can include sautés and echappes and maybe even changements. Center is not the main focus of class yet for beginners so it will likely take more time after a few classes., To prepare for splits later on, students can straighten one leg from the butterfly position and reach for it with the OPPOSITE arm. Be sure to do both legs. A good starting amount of time to hold stretches can be anywhere between 20-30 seconds. When students are ready, have them kneel on one knee and straighten another and stretch over. Do not have them split yet. Make sure, when they do try splits (after multiple classes), they have hands on both sides of the front leg., Chasses and sauté arabesques are great places to start. sauté arabesque arms should be added in later. Make sure both legs are done for chasses and try having them hold their arms in a steady position, such as second, all the way across the floor. Grand jetes are an enjoyable way to end class, even if the technique is not perfect yet., If an older beginner class, the students should not mind the classical music but a variety of speeds will still be appreciated. For younger students throwing in the occasional goofy song can help keep focus. Especially young students may need the whole class to be music they can enjoy, Disney music is a great option for this age group."

, Make sure you have tied the ribbons securely.

,, Let your platform touch the floor, and when you plie, you should arch your foot. Do the same crossing your left leg over your right.

, Relax your arms, and then roll up onto pointe. Now roll back down to flat. Focus on rolling through the demi-pointe. Don't bend your legs while doing this. Repeat a few more times.

, With your right foot, go through your demi-pointe and put pressure on your foot in this position. Now roll all the way through to a propped foot. Push over. Roll through your demi-pointe into flat position. Repeat with your left foot, and repeat the entire exercise a few more times.

, Roll down. Now, plie, then relieve, staying in first position.

, Make sure to ""massage the floor"", which means you should go through your demi pointe and keep contact with the floor the entire time. Put pressure on the floor like you are giving it a massage.

, Relieve and stay on pointe as you plie. Some people refer to this as ""pushing over"". If done properly, you will be stretching out your arch.

, Relieve, and then turn a 1/4 turn so that your left hand is on the barre. You should be in a fourth position here. Plie while staying up on pointe. Your back foot's weight should be only on your big toe. You don't want the whole platform to be on the floor because then you would be slicing your foot. Your front foot's weight should also be on the big toe, but only bevel your foot as much as you can without straining. After doing this, you can go back to second positioning, turn the other way, and repeat this exercise but to the left instead of the right.

, Plie, and then relieve into pase. See if you can balance. Check for a straight supporting leg, strong arms, turned- out legs, and strong, turned-out feet. Close back to fifth, bringing the pase-leg back. Close with control. Repeat with the other leg.

, Take one large step back away from the barre. Now, stand in fifth position, facing the barre. Plie both legs, tendu your front leg, and then, keeping your extended leg straight, step up onto that leg. This is called a pique. You should be in a pase position. Take hold of the barre to steady yourself. See if you can let go and balance. As in the previous exercise, look for a straight supporting leg, strong arms, turned-out legs, and strong, turned-out feet. Close back to fifth, bring the pase-leg back. Close with control. Take a large step back and repeat with the other foot.

"
Make sure you’re old enough.,
Take at least two years of prior ballet instructions.Though some students may be asked to wait longer, especially if they are not old enough, nobody should be considered for work on pointe until they have received, at minimum, two years of instruction in the fundamentals of ballet.,
Check the bone structure of your foot.,
Make sure you are at a healthy weight.,
Check if you have a strong, straight core and upright pelvis when dancing.,
See if you can do 16 relevés in a row in demi-pointe.Demi-pointe, also known as half-pointe, is when you balance on the balls of your foot rather than the toes of your foot.If you cannot perform 16 relevés in a row on demi-pointe from center, your muscles are not yet strong enough to go en pointe.,
Be able to maintain correct turnout while dancing on flat foot or demi-pointe.If you can’t maintain correct turnout normally, you will have a lot of trouble maintaining it en pointe, because it’s more difficult to maintain turnout then.,
Ask your teacher to assess your foot and ankle strength.,
Build ankle strength.There are many exercises you can do outside of ballet steps that will build up ankle strength to ensure you’re performing technical steps safely.,
Exercise with a Theraband.,
Practice metatarsal doming.Metatarsal doming exercises strengthen the small, intrinsic muscles in the foot that you don’t think about on a day-to-day basis, but which are very important for proper technique.,
Practice going on demi-pointe.,
Practice steps and exercises that will prepare you for pointe.",How to Tell if You Are Ready to Go on Pointe," Experts argue that it’s unsafe to begin dancing in pointe shoes before 11 or 12 years of age, because the bones in the foot are still hardening when you’re young.Dancing en pointe at a young age, before your bones are strong enough to support your weight, could result in permanent injury to your feet.;
,


This doesn’t mean that you took one ballet class a month for two years, and are now ready to go on pointe. You need regular, rigorous training to prepare for pointe shoes.
You should have consistently received at least 3-5 hours of training per week for the two years of prior instruction.

, Unfortunately some people will never be able to dance en pointe, no matter how hard they train, simply because the bone structure of their foot would result in injury if pointe were to be attempted. The ideal foot for dancing en pointe will have the following characteristics:


Toes should be about the same length, to provide a “squared-off” platform for stability. The most difficult foot shape is one in which the second toe is longest.
Ankle flexibility
High arch on the instep of the foot

, Because all of your body weight is distributed across your toes when you dance en pointe, instructors might hesitate to recommend you for pointe work if they worry your toes will not be able to handle the amount of weight you will be asking them to support.Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) to make sure you fall within a healthy weight category before attempting pointe., Have a teacher or parent evaluate you, or take a video recording of yourself dancing. It will be difficult to evaluate yourself in a mirror because craning your neck to watch your reflection might have a negative impact on your posture.


Your back muscles and lower abdominal muscles should be engaged in holding the trunk of your body straight.
You shouldn’t sink down into your pelvis or hip bone when placing weight on one leg.

,


Stand at a bar or other flat surface (like a table) to support yourself if you lose your balance.The releve can be performed from any position, first through fifth.Roll up onto the balls of your feet and hold that position for a few seconds.
Keep your weight centered over first three toes. Don't let your weight shift so you're balancing on your little toes.
Don't ""release your turnout"" by letting your heels turn backwards. Engage your rotators and abdominal muscles to keep your heels pointed inward so your toes point outward.
Roll back down until you're flat-footed.
Repeat 16 times.

, Your foot should stay in line with your kneecap and hip joint, with your ball of your big toe acting as the balancing pointe for your body weight. You should maintain straight knees and keep your heels forward to avoid sickling., Although there are general rules of thumb, ballet instructors are more and more relying on individual assessment of students’ feet and ankles to determine whether or not they are ready for pointe work.Either the instructor or a physical therapist recommended by your instructor will know what to look for in evaluating your body. If you think you meet the other benchmarks and are ready to begin pointe work, ask your instructor for an evaluation.

,


Play balance and catch: standing on one leg, throw a ball back and forth with a partner. The heavier the ball, the better the workout will be for your ankle. Have your partner throw it all around your center — above you, to your right and left, etc. — to further force your balance to shift.
One-legged squats: Extend one leg in front of you, then do ten half squats. Swing the leg out to the side and do 10 more half squats. Swing the leg behind you, and do ten more half squats. (Adjust reps up or down based on comfort level.)

, A Theraband is an elastic resistance band that can be used for both strength and flexibility training.Do the following exercise for 10 to 20 reps, or as much as you can.


Sit straight-backed on the floor with legs extended in front of you.
Loop the Theraband around the ball of your foot and pull backward to create tension.
In a slow, controlled motion, point and flex your toes, making sure your feet do not sickle.

,


In a standing position, tighten your toes to provide a stable base for your foot.
Pull your foot back, arching your instep as far as possible.
Hold this position for a count of six seconds, then relax for ten seconds.
Perform ten reps of this exercise on each foot.

, Although it’s safer than dancing en pointe, it’s actually more difficult to hold positions in demi-pointe. Practice dancing on demi-pointe to strengthen the muscle groups you’ll need to dance en pointe and work on your balance.

, Instructors will expect you to perform a specific set of steps when they make their decision about whether or not you are ready to graduate to pointe. Although you should ask your specific instructor what he or she will be looking for, in general, instructors are looking for the following abilities, which you should practice:


Hold a passé balance, in which you pull one leg up and tuck the ball of your foot into your knee, while standing on half-pointe for as long as you can.
Maintain perfect form during pliés, in which you bend your knees while maintaining your turnout, so your feet are pointed outward.
Pointe your feet when dancing; pointing when dancing on demi-pointe strengthens the muscles you will need en pointe.
Perform a piqué passé with straight leg: standing on one leg in demi-pointe, bring the other leg up into a passé balance, then bring it down to touch the ground, before bringing it back up into a passé balance.
Do 16 relevés in the center in a row.

Prepare yourself and your stretching area.,
Stretch your hamstrings.,
Stretch your feet.,
Use a ballet barre to do a bar stretch.,
Sit on your feet while in a kneeling position.",How to Stretch for Ballet1," A designated stretching area and appropriate clothing will help you get the most out of the exercises.

Have a designated area for stretching that is free of all clutter. If this isn’t possible, clear away any obstructive material (e.g. breakable china ornaments, expensive objects) from the area you will be using.Wear comfortable clothes (such as a tracksuit or bike shorts over a leotard or tight-fitting crossover).Pull long hair back into a ponytail or a bun so it isn't distracting.
If you have hard floors you may want to use a mat for floor stretches.;
, Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Touch your toes. If this hurts, then bend your legs slightly. Hold this position for 20 seconds. Repeat 2 times.









Stretch your hamstrings in a standing position by crossing your ankles and bending forward as far as possible. Keep your feet together during the stretch. Hold for 20 seconds and then repeat, crossing your legs in the other direction.Stretch your hamstrings by bending forward and placing your hands on the floor with your knees bent. Slowly straighten your knees without taking your hands off the floor.

, In a sitting position, place the foot you want to stretch over your thigh. With the hand closest to your heel, push into your heel. With your hand closest to your toes, place it over your toes and pull back so that your foot arches.








Allowing another person to stretch your feet may result in over-stretching and injury.
Jamming your feet under a door or standing on top of your bent toes may cause injury.
Use caution if using a foot stretcher., Start in first position, with your left hand on the barre. Lift your right leg onto the barre with your ankle resting on it and your foot pointed. Lift your right hand to high fifth position and lean forward onto the right leg. Hold for 30 seconds then repeat on the other side.








Keep your back flat.
Keep both legs turned out.

, Straighten one leg out in front of you (still sitting on the other foot) and point your toes. Touch your toes with both hands. Hold for 20 seconds. Repeat with the other leg.

Master the appropriate level of ballet technique.,
Observe the teaching styles of competent ballet teachers.,
Create a lesson plan based on the setting and student ability.,
Structure your class.,
Select appropriate ballet music.,
Wear appropriate ballet attire.,
Speak clearly and concisely when teaching ballet.,
Target your teaching to the skill level of the majority.,
Display confidence and enthusiasm.",How to Teach Ballet,"


Learn advanced ballet technique. If you intend to teach advanced ballet classes, study with master teachers who have performed and taught extensively.
Gain rudimentary knowledge of ballet for teaching young children. If your goal is to teach recreational ballet to kids, your ability to hold their attention and create an interesting class will be more important than mastering advanced ballet technique.;
, Ask permission from dance schools to observe classes. Pay close attention to the interaction between the teacher and her students, as well as the specific teaching methods that keep students engaged.

,


Decide what movements and terminology you will teach in a single class. In a dance studio where you teach the same dance level each time, your class attendees may be different from day-to-day. When teaching an introductory ballet class, cover the basic ballet positions and other fundamental movements, such as plie�, tendu, jete, releve and retire.
Outline a plan for long-term students. If teaching in a college or community center where students have committed to attending class regularly, create a plan for the entire program. Start with basic ballet positions and teach more involved dance sequences by the end of the program.

, Ballet classes have barre routines, across the floor movements and a sequence to be performed in the center of the room. Adhere to this structure closely so that students know what to expect from one class to the next.

,


Buy a ballet class compilation CD. Purchase music online or visit a music store. Ask your ballet teacher(s) for recommendations.
Compile your own CD. Select music with the appropriate tempo, mood and rhythm to match the movements and skill level.

, If the dance studio has a strict dress code for students, such as a black leotard, pink tights and ballet shoes, abide by the same attire to set a good example. In community centers, it is generally acceptable to be more relaxed in your dance attire.

,


Enunciate the names of the ballet movements. Repeat them each time to reinforce learning. Limit extensive explanations during the ballet class. Students will learn more by watching and attempting to do the movements themselves.
Use brief metaphors if necessary. For students who need imagery, liken ballet movements to common images. Study the motion of animals and the appearance of nature, and verbally express them as metaphors for dance movement.

, If the majority are intermediate students, move at their pace.


Work independently with slower students during breaks or after class. Recommend slower students to other appropriate level classes, if available.
Challenge more advanced students. If the class is doing 2 turns, for example, ask advanced students to attempt 3 or 4 turns.

, Your teaching ability will strengthen with repeated practice. Use your passion for the dance form to inspire your students to persevere and enjoy the learning process.

Do left splits by putting your left leg in front of you and your right leg behind you.
Do center splits by extending each leg at a right angle to your body.

, With your legs extended in a V in front of you, press your inside ankles against the wall, forcing your legs to stretch wider. Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds.








Do not over-stretch. Stop if this exercise is painful.


, Lie on your back and put your feet up in the air. Cross your ankles then widen your legs into a split. Repeat 10 times, alternating the ankle cross.








, There are several kinds of lunges which can be done to stretch. Two of the most popular are Standard and Side lunges. Do 10-12 repetitions for each leg.








Standard lunges: Stand with legs hip-width apart. Maintain a straight posture. Step forward with one leg and lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Your rear knee should touch or nearly touch the floor. Repeat with other leg.
Side lunges: Stand with legs hip-width apart. Maintain a straight posture. Take a big step to your right side, bending your right knee and lowering your body until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Your left leg should remain straight with your foot in contact with the floor. Repeat with the other side.

, Complete a full turn while balanced on one foot. Think about “pulling up”: imagine there is a string coming from the top of your head attached to the ceiling.

Assess physical fitness.,
Find a suitable dance school.,
Purchase the right clothes.,
Select the right shoes.,
Attend your first class.,
Practice and continue studying ballet.,
Talk with your teacher after class.",How to Start Ballet As an Adult," Be sure that you are fit enough to take on exercise. As with any new form of exercise, sport, or physical exertion in your life, you should be sure of your fitness level. If you have any concerns, visit your doctor. Ballet requires a lot of stretching to make you flexible, so if you have any problems with muscle seizure, etc., you should speak with a professional and the dance school before starting.;
, Many ballet dance schools cater for adult dancers, from beginners, to refreshers, to advanced. It isn't a good idea to barge in on a child's class; you will feel klutzy in comparison to the natural flexibility and grace of children. Speak with the teachers beforehand about your level of dance knowledge to find the right class for your needs. Most dance schools will have at least one adult beginner class available and if not, encourage them to consider it! Note that adult dance classes are often held at night as well as during the day, to help those who work daytime.

, You won't need a tutu to begin with but a good leotard, exercise tights, a crossover cardigan are all suitable starter items. If you buy these at dance shops, however, be aware that you will be outlying a fair bit! Usually these items are of quality make, so they should last you. And you can always start with gym gear or just a t-shirt and sweat pants if you like - there is no need to splurge until you're sure this is right for you.


Most dance teachers will understand if you don't feel comfortable wearing only a leotard and tights. If you talk to the teacher about this, they are likely to let you wear a skirt or gym clothes. The main thing is that the clothes allow the teacher to check your technique and don't hinder your movements.

, Ballet wouldn't be ballet without the shoes, and this is one item you shouldn't skimp on. Buy quality leather or canvas ballet shoes. It is very important to ask the dance school first as to their preferred shoe options. And do not purchase pointe shoes - they are for the professional, advanced dancer and it may well be that you never get to that stage. Be prepared to also buy the ballet ribbons that tie on the shoes separately and sew them on yourself. This isn't hard to do - just get the ribbon lengths accurate and use a simple stitch to sew them into the shoe lining. Ask the store or your dance school if you're not sure what to do.

, Ballet classes usually begin with a warm-up at the barre and some stretching. As the lessons proceed, you will get to learn a range of different steps, jumps, slides, dance moves etc. If your school encourages performance, you may even get to the point of rehearsing for an end-of-year performance or such.

, Keep it up. At first you might find coordination hard to grasp, as well as stretching and getting sequences right. It takes a lot of practice initially, so if you can practice at home, do so. Remember that the more you do, the better shape your body will be in and the long-term flexibility benefits of ballet are excellent.

, Feedback on your progress is important and allows you to pinpoint the areas that need further work and concentration.

Rise slow then fast.,
Push down into the floor.,
Turnout.,
Engage.,
Lift your eye-line.,
Lock your legs out.,
Smile!",How to Stay En Pointe," When going up en pointe, try not to suddenly rise, unless of course you are doing a relevé. This will make you go off balance when you get en pointe. Instead, go up slowly until you are nearly at demi pointe and then you can snatch until on full pointe.;
, When you do get up en pointe, it is difficult to stay up there. Bend your foot over and stab into the ground. This plants your feet into the floor and gives you a sturdy support below.

, Most people think that turnout comes from the ankles, but it does not; it comes from the hips. If you push your hips and thighs out and push your heels forwards then it is a lot easier to stay up and makes the position look a lot more attractive and professional.

, The most important thing when en pointe is to engage your centre and your buttocks. This may sound silly, but it works. Clench your butt cheeks and use your abdominal muscles to provide strength to your legs and lower back.

, It is a lot harder to balance if you are looking at the floor, so lift your head, and look out front instead. Pretend that you are on a stage and everyone is looking at how fantastic you look. It helps you pull out, takes strain of your feet, and improves your posture.

, Straighten your legs and lock them out. Obviously it is more difficult to balance on relaxed knees.

, After all the technical work, smiling always helps. Everyone knows that.

Point your feet.",How to Prevent Knee Injuries in Ballet," Find an instructor at a pre-professional ballet school that works with a professional ballet company. A great instructor can provide one-on-one help which can prevent injury and improve your poses.Avoid simply relying on instruction from your peers or online lessons. You need to get proper feedback from a professional who's able to see if you're technique is correct.;
, Avoid dancing on hard floors like cement. Instead, the studio you use should have sprung wood (like harlequin) floors. This will help the floor absorb the shock of your movements. A good floor can prevent shin splints and other injuries.Make sure the floor doesn't have too much rosin covering it in uneven patches. This can make it more likely for you to injure yourself.

, Warming up exercises can loosen your muscles, making them less likely to tear or strain. Do exercises that get your blood pumping and really warm you up before you begin dancing.These will get you ready for more intense activity, which can improve your ballet dancing and prevent injury.


Do standing exercises for several minutes or try an aerobic exercise at a normal pace. Never push yourself too hard during a warm up.

, Exercise (physical training) is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of injury. While ballet is highly physical, most ballet dancers aren't active enough to improve their aerobic health. Work on a general fitness regimen throughout the week to reduce your risk of injury.Be sure to avoid sports that are known for causing damage to the knees like basketball or tennis.

, If you feel pain, this is your body telling you that something is wrong. Ask your instructor to watch you do the movement that caused you pain. Sometimes, you might just need technique correction which will stop the pain. But, if your instructor sees nothing wrong with your form, see a doctor.If no specific move is causing you pain, follow the three day rule. If you feel pain for three days, tell your instructor.

, Your knees should always be in-line with your toes. If they're out of alignment, you'll put excess strain on the kneecaps and your lower leg muscles whether you're doing a plie or turnout. Stand with your knees soft and keep your spine elongated.Never lock your knees. This can hyperextend your knee, increasing mobility. But, it will also lead to knee injury and mis-alignment.

, Research shows that using your knees spread your feet apart creates poor alignment and can lead to injury.Instead, keep your muscles flexible. Lift your toes up and away from each other so that they're each at 90 degree angles. You should shift your weight not from your knees, but from your hips. This will help your feet move apart naturally.


You should never force your turnout. Using your knees instead of your hip muscles can put extra strain on your lower leg muscles and damage your knee.

, Foot hyperpronation (""rolling in"") is a cause of knee injuries. When your feet roll in, the arches roll forward. Your tendons will try to compensate for this imbalance, leading to injury and inflammation (like tendonitis).Instead, balance your weight throughout your foot.


You should feel your weight at the heel, the big toe, and the little toe., Your foot should be pointed so that it creates a straight line extending from your calf. If you try to force your toes or point harder, you may actually make your foot sickle inward. Sickling breaks the imaginary line stretching from your calf so that it curves. It can also damage your muscles and form leading to injury.You should keep your heel forward, not off to the side which can cause your foot to turn inward."

Lift yourself up onto your ""tippy-toes"" and begin to squat down by lowering your hips down towards the floor.
Keep your inner thighs and knees pressed together as you lower your hips. Slowly raise back up to the starting position.
Repeat this exercise 20 times or as many times as you can.

, This barre exercise will help strengthen multiple areas of your body including your arms and legs.Start by:


Stand next to a sturdy chair so your hip is perpendicular to the back of the chair. Place your right arm on the top of the back of the chair. In the left hand, hold a light dumbbell. Feet should be hip-width apart.
Slowly lift your right leg (leg closest to the chair) behind you keeping your leg straight and your toes pointed.
As you do this, slowly bend your left knee slightly and hinge forward at your hips so your face and torso are facing the floor. Lift your left arm with the dumbbell out to the side.
Lower both your arms and return to the standing position. Repeat 20 times on each side.

, This particular barre move focuses on toning and strengthening your triceps in addition to working on balance.Holding one dumbbell in each hand, bend your arms behind your head at a 90 degree angle. Your feet should be hip-width apart and toes point at a 45 degree angle away from your body.
While holding your abs tight, push up through your toes until you're on ""tippy-toes."" As you push up, also lift your hands up towards the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Slowly lower your arms and legs back down to their starting positions. Repeat this exercise 20 times total or as many times as you can.

, If you're interested in trying a barre workout, the best place to start is to find a barre studio in your area or a local dance studio that offers barre classes. Ask friends, family, and coworkers for recommendations.


Although there are ways to do barre workouts at home, these moves are not your traditional exercise or strength training exercises. It'll be beneficial to go to a class to watch other students and to get guidance from the instructor.
Also, barre classes can be pricey. Research a couple of studios to see the range of prices. In addition, some studios will offer discounts if you purchase a longer-term membership instead of individual classes.
Consider looking for barre studios that have classes tailored to your needs. You may find specific barre classes for: beginners, women who are pregnant, those who are senior citizens or those who are advanced practitioners.
Ask the studio about the style of classes they offer. ask the studio or facility about the style of the barre class they offer, whether it is fast paced or slow paced, and whether the instructor has a dance background. Knowing the type of music that is played can give you a good idea of how the class will feel and whether it suits you.

, If you're new to a barre workout, or any workout, consider getting to the class or studio a little early. This can help you get yourself set up and prepared for the workout ahead.Many instructors recommend that beginners or first time barre practitioners arrive to the studio early. They usually have some forms or waivers for you to fill out.While you're there, talk to the instructor. Tell her you're new and haven't done this workout before. Don't be embarrassed about this! She will be able to help you and give you additional guidance during class.
The instructor may also be able to give you a little tour of the studio. She will show you the barres, mats and places where you'll be doing the exercise.
In addition, ask for a run-down of the routine so you can get an idea of what to expect from the class.

, Like many different types of exercise or fitness routines, it's important to be prepared with the right type of clothing.


For barre classes, there is a specific wardrobe recommended. It's recommended to wear fitted pants, leggings or capris to class. Shorts are typically not allowed. Also wear a fitted shirt that covers your mid-drift. Sports bras or tank tops showing your stomach are typically not permitted.Barre workouts also require some specialty socks. It's recommended to wear sticky socks to help prevent your feet from sliding during the workout. Also, remove your shoes prior to walking through the actual studio.Wearing the right type of clothing will help you be as flexible as possible and keep you comfortable and safe.

, As with any workout or exercise routine, you want to stay adequately hydrated.Even if you don't think barre will work up a sweat, be prepared to work hard and need some fluids.


It's a good idea to have a water bottle with you during your barre workout to help keep you hydrated during this routine. In addition, follow up your workout with more water.
Bringing a 16–30 oz (0.5 to 1 litre) water bottle to an hour barre workout should be sufficient. In addition, you shouldn't need any type of sports drink or electrolyte drink for this particular exercise.
Also, make sure you stay adequately hydrated throughout the entire day. In total, you should aim for about eight to 13 glasses of water daily., Although barre classes are a great workout, they're not considered aerobic exercises or cardiovascular exercises. Make sure to include more cardio in addition to your barre routine.


Health professionals typically recommend doing about 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of cardiovascular activity each week.Aim for moderate-intensity exercises. This should get your heart rate elevated, breathing pace faster and cause you to sweat.
Exercises that can be included are: walking, jogging, using the elliptical, hiking, dancing, swimming or doing an aerobics class.

, Barre workouts do help you tone and strengthen your muscles; however, this type of exercise does not provide the same benefits as more traditional forms of strength training.


Strength training exercises like squats or lunges are considered compound exercises, not isometric exercise like barre moves. Compound exercises help build more strength than isometric exercises.If you want to tone and build strength, do a combination of traditional strength training exercises with your barre classes.

, Barre classes might not seem like a hard or intense workout, but you'll be feeling all those little subtle motions the next day. Plan for rest days to help your body recover.


There are a variety of reasons to include one to two days of rest during the week. The biggest reason is that your muscles actually grow in size and strength while at rest — not when you lift weights or work.Never taking a rest can also lead to burnout and fatigue. Take a break for your mental and physical well being."

On the day, be careful to take every single costume and accessory with you. If you forget a costume, it would be a heartbreak. If you have a lot of costumes, make a checklist and check them off as you go. Have family members help gather them together and bring them.

Distorted placement looks terrible., Step into an arabesque with the leg at a height you can control. Hold for a count of five. Repeat several times, stepping onto the same leg, until you are all the way across the studio. Repeat on the other side.

, Although you don't have to dress up extremely formal (like a black-tie event), wear a nice dress, or dress shirt and slacks. To dress nicely is to show respect for the performers and fellow audience members. Do not wear jeans and tennis shoes, or a frumpy t-shirt.

Are they more interested in performance or technique? What do they like to see in dancers? Knowing these types of things are helpful to have in mind when you audition.;
, Don't come to an audition after a vacation. You should be taking class right up until the audition day so that you are in shape. Get plenty of sleep the night before, and eat a good breakfast and/or lunch. Make sure that you are hydrated before, because it is not polite to drink water in the middle of an audition.

, It is hard to dance on an empty stomach. It will make your nerves worse; however, you don't want to eat directly before the audition otherwise you will end up feeling sick after the movement. It is best to eat an hour beforehand so you can use the bathroom and not have to use it during the audition., Make sure to drink lots of water before the audition, as it is very rude to take your water bottle in the studio, because usually auditions only take 30 minutes to 1 hour., You can usually find out what attire is required on the school's website or brochure. Usually auditions require girls to wear black leotards and pink tights, and boys to wear white shirts and black tights. If the color leotard is not specified, the choice is all yours between keeping it simple and classic (for example, black or white) or going with some more unique and bold. If you must wear black, choose colored earrings or a pretty headband to wear so you will be remembered more easily. Choose a leotard with a simple, flattering style, and don't wear patterned or multicolored outfits. Part of being a ballet dancer is having good taste. Small earrings and rings are all right, but remove all of your other jewelry. Don't wear dangly jewelry or anything that gets in the way. Never, ever wear legwarmers, black tights, or any other ""junk"" to a ballet audition.

, Looking nice and professional is very important in an audition; it shows that you are serious about what you do. Make sure your body, hair and clothes are clean and neat. Your hair doesn't have to be completely slicked back, but make sure that it is still neat without loose strands. Make sure your slippers and pointe shoes are in good condition, with no drawstrings or threads hanging out, and your tights are free from holes. Never go auditioning without make up, but keep it light. Enhance your traits, but don't use stage make up. Also, wake up early to not get a swollen face.

, Like the attire, the materials you need are most likely specified on the website or brochure. Most auditions have a fee of anywhere from $5 to $30. Some require a headshot, photos, or a resume, and some don't. If you are not sure about photos, bring along a headshot and a first arabesque photo just in case. It is better to be safe then sorry. Don't forget to take some suitable pins in order to pin your number sheet to your leotard. Pointework is usually included in auditions, so remember your pointe shoes if you have them. Make sure your pointe shoes are going to work for you. Test them out the day before, if needed. There is nothing more frustrating then being limited by dead or too-hard shoes.

, It is a good idea to arrive at least thirty minutes early. You want time to adjust to your surroundings and relax, and you will also need to fill out an application. If you are auditioning for a large or popular school, there is likely to be a line at check in. Don't feel like you need to be one of the first in line. Because large auditions usually have dancers go in groups, if you have a later number it will give you time to watch other dancers before it is your turn. Everyone will be seen equally regardless of their number. Never ever arrive late. Allow yourself plenty of time.

, Do the exercises you usually do before class; it will help to calm you down if you do your usual routine. Make sure you a quite warm before class, because many auditions do not do a long and intensive barre.

, Don't think of it as a competition, because it's not. Treating it as such will make you more nervous. Instead, focus on your own dancing and understand that the others are trying to do so as well. Also, the directors and those auditioning dancers can spot a rude unfriendly dancer from a mile away. It doesn't impress them.

, Even if it is okay to drink water, talk, or sit down in your class at home, don't do it now. Don't lean against the bar or cross your arms. Don't be too casual.

, The directors will know who's putting on airs. Don't try to be too eager or too nice or too perfect. Just aim to be kind and respectful, and be yourself.

, Pick up the combinations as quickly as you can. A couple of mistakes are not a big deal, but if you repeatedly do not know the exercise, the directors will question your retention ability. If the teacher corrects you, do your best to apply the correction. It shows that you are teachable, and you respect and care about what they say. Also, it is your responsibility to keep track of what group and formation you are in, so that they do not need to take up time figuring out where you go.

, This is one of the most important parts of an audition. Never change any part of the combinations that the teacher shows. The school that you are auditioning for might practice a different ballet style than you are used to. That's okay. If this is the case, try to pick up the obvious details of the new style, such as placement of arms before a turn, etc. The directors will be judging how well you can adapt to the new style.

, When it comes to turns, do what you are comfortable with. Don't aim for four pirouettes if you know you can't land them cleanly. For an audition, do only what you know you can control. You want to push yourself more in class, but in an audition, the directors want a clear understanding of your technique level.

, Don't size up the competition by comparing yourself to others. It will waste your energy, and chances are, you probably won't do as well. Do class as you normally would, and focus on doing the best that you can.

, Even if you are nervous, try to smile and look pleasant. It will help you to relax. You don't have to be mechanical, and you don't have to be perfect. Smile if the teacher says something funny. Ask questions if you're confused (don't ask too many). If you fall from a pirouette, keep going. Finish with a smile, because chances are, the instructors were not even watching you when you fell. If you forget the exercise, just correct yourself and move on. Don't obsess over every little mistake, because that's not what directors care about. They are looking at your dancing as a whole.

, You may notice your body feels a little shaky or you can't focus as well because of nerves. Just take a breath and make yourself calm down. You're doing the same steps you do everyday, and you've been working hard for this! Show off what you can do!

, If the instructor corrects you, respond with a smile and say thank you. Corrections do not mean you were not doing well. It means the instructor was watching you; they saw your potential and wanted to help you."

Keep practicing.",How to Improve Ballet Turnout," Since incorrect turnout can damage muscles and lead to knee problems, it's important that you work on your turnout with a professional ballet dancer. Try to find a pre-professional ballet school that is associated with a professional ballet company. This way, an instructor can give you individual attention, helping you achieve the perfect turnout.


Since the muscles of young ballet dancers are still developing, it's easier to improve flexibility when you're young (before age 12).;
, Before you turnout, stand in front of a mirror with your feet touching and facing forward in a parallel position. Keep your muscles flexible and make sure your tailbone is pointed down, not pushed out and back.Stand firmly on your feet.


If you're too tense when you begin to turnout, you're more likely to cause muscle strain and injury.Spend at least 10 minutes stretching your leg and hip muscles before dancing.

, Once you're in the correct position, lift your toes up and away from each other (in opposite 90 degree angles). It is critical that you do not simply twist your feet away by using your knees and lower legs. Instead, shift your weight to your hips so that your feet naturally move apart. Make sure you're not putting all your weight on your big toes, instead of distributing it throughout your feet.


The ideal turnout is 180 degrees. Don't worry if you can't turnout that much. Stretching can improve your flexibility by a few degrees. Good turnout also means that you're honest about what your natural turnout is and don't try to force it.Make sure your weight is evenly distributed throughout your foot. Poor turnout puts strain on just your big toes and rolls your feet in. Instead, your feet should be level with the ground.

, While it may seem easy to use your knees in order to spread your feet farther apart, do not do it. This will strain your knees and legs. Research shows that this causes poor alignment and can lead to injury.Turnout should feel like a natural stance. You shouldn't feel any strain in holding it while in any position. If you continue to practice poor turnout, you'll begin to feel knee pain and muscle ache.


It's easiest to force your feet when you're in the 5th position.But, you should always be on guard against improperly rotating out your feet.

, Lay on your stomach while resting on your elbows and forearms. Move your feet together. The knees should be pointing out so that you make a diamond. Your feet should be touching and remain on the floor. Breathe and hold the position for 3 to 6 breaths. Do as many reps as you comfortable can. The frog stretch can open your hips, groin and inner thigh muscles.To properly stretch your muscles, keep your bottom on the floor (not raised up in the air).

, Sit on the floor and place your feet together so that your ankles rotate out in a diamond shape. Hold your feet with your hands and sit up straight. Try to bring your ankles down to the ground so that your hip opens up.Hold the pose for 30 seconds at a time and repeat it as often as you feel comfortable. The butterfly stretch can improve the muscles of your hips, groin, and inner thigh which can all make you more flexible.It may help to have someone slowly push down on your knees for maximum flexibility.

, Kneel and set a pillow under one of your knees. Keep both of your legs turned in and lunge forward with the knee that doesn't have the pillow under it. Lunge until your knee makes a 90 degree angle and rest your hands on your knee. Keep pushing till you feel a slight stretch and hold for 15 seconds. Repeat this 3 or 4 times. Then do it with the opposite knee.You should keep your hips level and make sure your tailbone doesn't stick out. Your back should be straight.
Lunge stretches can improve your hip rotation, making turnouts easier.

, Lay on your back and keep your knees together and bent. Wrap an elastic band (like a theraband) around your thighs. Slowly lift your pelvis and back up so that they align with your wrapped thighs. Slowly bring your spine back to the ground.This stretch can strengthen your hamstrings, back, and bottom.You can also do this with one leg crossed over the other, so that one thigh rests on the other. This will challenge you to keep your pelvis aligned with your thighs.

, Lay on your side so that your knees are bent and one rests on the other. Rest an elbow on the ground so you can sit up a bit. Wrap an elastic band (like a theraband) around your mid-thigh. Rotate your top leg out and in, 10 to 15 times. Repeat this with the other leg until the leg muscles feel relaxed.Avoid doing this stretch too many times or you could injure your muscles.

, Stretching can improve your turnout, but it will take time. Stretch and practice your turnout every day. This can gradually help your muscles loosen and stretch more, giving you a bigger turnout. While it's best to start young, regular practice can still improve your flexibility.


The American Ballet Theatre National Training Curriculum says that stretches like the lunge stretch can improve your turnout by a few degrees."

Buy all the things your teacher says you need for the class.,
On the day before, pack up all your stuff in your dance bag.,
Arrive at your ballet studio at least 15 minutes before class so you can put on your leotard, tights, shoes, etc.,
If you are dancing on pointe, make sure you have your ribbons tied correctly and your pointe shoe pads in.

,
When the time comes to start, work your hardest and stretch as much as you can to warm up so you will not pull muscles and it will help with your flexibility.

",How to Get Ready for a Ballet Class," Some required items for most studios are: leotards, tights, ballet slippers pointe shoes, ballet shorts/skirts, and hair ties. Also buy a dance bag. If there is a required uniform (usually the black leotard and pink tights, pink ballet shoes, hair in a tight bun), be sure to follow it and do not break the dress code rules!;
, Bring a small sweat rag for class too. After class you will be sweaty and sometimes stinky, so bring deodorant.

, and put your hair in a tight bun. Make sure your bun is secure (use a thin mist of hairspray). If they have portable barres it's a good idea to do some plies and tendus at the barre.

,,"
"
Get several pairs of tights.,
Buy a leotard.,
Tie long hair into a bun.,
Purchase soft ballet slippers.,
As a uniform, some studios have students wear socks instead of tights, or wear an additional skirt.,
If your instructor has told you it is okay for you to go en pointe, ask your teacher to come with you to the fitting of your pointe shoes.",How to Dress for a Ballet Class," Usually pink tights are requested, but sometimes studios will want black or tan tights. Some studios don't have any preference. Check with your studio to see which color of tights they prefer. Also, check which style they prefer. There are many styles, from simple no-seam footed, to convertible foot with seam and mesh! Again, some studios may not have any preference, and you can choose which you think is most comfortable. If you are doing pointe work, you may want convertibles for your feet—these have holes on the bottom of the foot. This will make it easier to put on toe pads if you put them inside your tights.;
, Black is most commonly preferred, but dress codes differ between studios. Some studios don't have a preference. Check to see which color and style your studio prefers, whether it be camisole, tank, short-sleeved, or any other style they have out there.

, You can do this by pulling the hair back into a neat high ponytail, then twisting the hair until it coils around the elastic. Add bobby pins, U pins, and a hair-net. Use hairspray or clips if you have any whispy bits of hair that need taming. If the hair is too short to create a bun, just pull it back into a ponytail. If you have questions about hair, you can ask your studio's instructor.

, Most studios want pink, but some have different preferences. Go to a dance wear retailer and have them fit you for shoes. Ask your studio for which color and model they prefer. Most will not have a specific model that they require, but it is always good to ask. Make sure they fit your feet well: if they are too big, your foot will look flat. If they are too small, your feet will be crammed and dancing will be harder.

, Other studios want students to wear a colored hip-alignment belt to differentiate between levels. Ask you studio about additional uniform pieces.

, They will tell you what they want in a shoe, and can help you choose what is best for your feet! DO NOT buy pointe shoes before they give you the ok. These are quite dangerous and can badly injure you if you are not ready.

Say thank you at the end.",How to Do Well in a Ballet Exam," If it's short, comb through it. If it's long, put your hair in a bun. Use hairspray on flyaway hair, to keep it looking neat. Use pins and a hairnet, unless otherwise specified by your examiner. Do use hairspray or gel if needed.;
, Ballet examiners don't like it when you have anything underneath your leotard (other than a bra) or on top. This includes t-shirts, leg warmers, pants, shorts, skirts, or other warm ups. Remove all jewelry except for small stud earrings, and take off any nail polish.

, This includes clean tights that are free of holes, a clean leotard (or bodysuit), immaculate ballet slippers or pointe shoes (if necessary)––no fraying ribbons, and any other ballet wear in its absolute best condition, as specified by your examiner.

, Stretching will help prevent injury while dancing, and is also very important for high extensions. You will need to stretch you arms and legs for at least 10 minutes before you perform for the examiner.

, Show the examiner that you are willing to enjoy the exam, even if you're nervous. Sometimes smiling can actually make you feel more confident.

, This will show the examiner that you care, and that you are bringing you ballet technique with you. Stand and walk like a proper dancer.

, Don't be embarrassed to say ""Good morning"" or ""Good afternoon"". They'll appreciate your respect and it can also help them to warm to you.

, If you skip this step or are unsure of any of your exercises, you will not do as well as you could. If it helps, buy the music for your pieces. This way, you can run through the dances at home. Practice till you are confident with it, and tell yourself that you can do it!

, When the music comes on, think about how it makes you feel inside. Is it sharp, swift, and quick? Or is it smooth and free flowing? Perhaps it is slow, gentle and soft. Use these feelings in your movements. Let your expression come out and don't be afraid to show it - if you are, you will appear as stiff and nervous!


Practicing expressions at home beforehand will help your expressions to come out more smoothly.

, Find a focus during the exam. Do not stare at the examiner, but make sure you do sometimes look at them. Otherwise, they will see how nervous you are.


Be confident. Stand up straight, keep your eyes up, and try not to watch the other girls.

, Keep a good, positive attitude and don't turn him/her off with a snotty, proud air. If you appear as vain and snobby, the examiner will not have a very good impression of you. Be well mannered.

,, Always thank the teacher, examiners, and pianist. Again, this helps keep a lasting impression, and also shows that you are respectful, which is an important trait to being a dancer.

Find a place with a wood floor and if possible, a full body mirror. Regular ballet schools have barres, mirrors, and wood floors. If you have an empty room, dance there. If you have enough space in your bedroom, dance there. You can even go to a community center and borrow a room there. It's whatever place you can feel good in.
Use something in place of a barre. In ballet, most classes use barres. You can make one easily out of wood, pipes, or even a table and chairs! Learn how to make a barre yourself. If you don't want to, use the back of chair or table. Anything that supports your weight and is balanced.;
, Music is an important part of the rhythm keeping for ballet. Create a playlist of your favorite music. Any genre from pop to classical can be used to work out to, although classical is more appropriate. Picking something upbeat and motivating is key. Whatever music you can keep track of counts with, is suitable. If you are used to classical music, this might be the best kind of music to listen to.

, You can use these to inform your workout or even have them playing as you practice. If you have a remote, you can play and pause or repeat during your practice session without having to keep going over to the music player each time.


Subscribe to a channel of any ballet classes you like the most. That way, you can keep updated on new additions to help you to vary your workout over time.

, When you're just at home, you don't need to wear a tutu unless you'd dearly love to. Bring out a leotard and tights if you have a pair, but if you don't, find something comfortable like sweats and a T-shirt or anything you can stretch in and feel free in.


Wear the right type of shoes. If you have ballet slippers, great. Socks are not a substitute. Go barefoot. Never use tennis shoes or hard shoes, and don't use streetwear ballet flats. Even though they're called ballet flats, you shouldn't use them for ballet!

, Before you do anything, you must first warm up. Dancing without warming up can cause injuries. You then want to do some basic stretches, like the butterfly or straddle. If you don't, this could cause muscles to hurt or stretch too far. You can look up some videos of people warming up and stretching before ballet class and maybe try them. Never over-stretch (especially before you dance), this is not good.

, Pliés are the simplest dance move. A plié is simply bending your knees in a squat like position. Do this holding on to your barre in first position, second position and fourth position.

, A tendue is brushing your leg out and in on the floor with a pointed foot and straight leg. Tendues can go to the front, side or back. Do them from first position.

, Jetés are tendues, but bringing them about an inch or two (2.5 to 5cm) above the floor. They can also be done to the front, side, or back.

, A grand battement is a kick with a pointed toe and straight leg.


When doing them, try not to thrust into it, but make it calm and try to keep your upper body still.

, Sautés are jumps. They can be done in first, second or fifth positions. All you have to do is plié, and spring off the ground, and land in a plié.

, Look up some ballet-themed workouts or routines in video form. Watch some ballet classes on YouTube to help get some ideas to form your routine or workout, as explained above. Whatever workout or routine you choose to do at home, ensure that there is sufficient space to dance freely in, and that it is within your current ability, or it won't be enjoyable.


Remember not to get into anything too complicated while you're at home by yourself or this could create bad habits that can be hard to break (plus you can easily hurt yourself).
If you already dance, practice some dance routines that you learned in dance class.

, The main part of doing ballet at home is having fun. Always feel free and have a great time dancing your heart out. Remember, nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it.

Go there yourself to check out the teaching, if you don't already work with a teacher. Talk with people who know what they're doing to make sure you are getting the proper and safe training.


It is better to continue pointe-work with a teacher you have had for several years. They should be able to tell you when you are ready for pointe-work.;
, The most important thing about starting pointe-work is knowing when to begin. Pointe-work is difficult and requires years and years of training to become proficient.


To start pointe-work, the dancer must be extremely strong and well trained in basic ballet techniques. You must be physically and mentally prepared to start this kind of work.
Do not ever attempt pointe-work without a professional instructor to give you the go-ahead. Dancing on pointe can be somewhat painful to a beginner or someone without proper instruction.

, Continue your basic ballet classes as normal, focusing on maintaining balance in your ankles and strengthening them as much as possible. Ankle strength is one of the most essential components of successful pointe work, and it's likely you won't be recommended for moving forward with dancing en pointe unless your ankles are very strong.


On your own, practice heel-raises to help strengthen your ankles. Stand on your toes and raise your heels up in the air, flexing your calves. Stay balanced. Repeat these raises in sets of 10 or 15. Do three sets, with a minute of rest in between.

, Going on pointe for the first time will not be comfortable. It may be difficult and confusing to feel your feet in them, but it gets much easier as time goes by. It's important to go in with the correct expectations so you don't get discouraged. If you've been taking ballet for a few years, get excited! You're almost taking the next big step into advanced ballet.


If you're a little freaked out, get beginner pointe shoes. They will support your feet better if you don't have as strong a foot as is needed to stand fully on your toes yet.

, Once you have found a good beginner’s pointe class, go to the store and buy your pointe shoes. Talk to a salesperson at the store and ask for assistance.


Make sure that your pointe shoes fit your feet snugly. They should make your feet look long and thin. If you have soft arches, make sure that the shoe you get has a soft shank. Some good shoes for people with soft arches are Capezio, Mirella, and Bloch Sonata. If you have strong arches, you should try Grishko and Russian Pointe.
Don’t buy the shoes online. Pointe shoes are extremely hard to fit, and you should take at least a half hour with the salesperson to find the right fit. Don’t try to purchase shoes in a larger size, expecting that you will grow into them. The shoes should fit perfectly and be slightly difficult to put on.

, Once you have found a good pair of pointe shoes, go and check with your instructor. Do whatever your instructor says. If you need to go get different ones, go get different ones. Your instructor’s discretion is the most important information you can get for your safety and comfort. If possible, have your teacher come with you to buy your first pair.

, Break in the shoes correctly. A good way to break in your pointe shoes is to use your hands and roll through the arch. Try to break them in with your hands first, at home, before you wear them into the studio. Normally your teacher will show you how to sew them, but if he/she does not, then look up videos on YouTube. Note: some brands, such as Gaynor Mindens, do not require breaking in. Do research before attempting any type of method on your shoes.


As important as it is to break in the shoes, don't overdo it until you are experienced with pointe shoes. Never break in your shoes sickled or it is just a wasted pair of pointe shoes.
Don’t use gel pads for beginning with. You need to feel the floor. Instead, use a thin foam, wool, or fabric padding.

, Now that your shoes are broken in, you can go to your first class. For a beginner’s class, you will spend a good amount of time at the barre for warm up exercises. You probably won’t go in the center at first. Your teacher will decide that for you. Dancing en pointe is very hard, and being good at it is even harder.


Do not wear your pointe shoes without your teacher, but wait for your instructor's approval. Be patient. For many dancers, beginner classes aren't super-fun, but they are crucial to building strength.

, You want to focus on lifting out of the shoes. Remind yourself that the longer and harder you work at the barre, the stronger you will be for the center exercises.


Keep a strong core. Dancing en pointe is much harder to maintain balance and so it is crucial to have a strong core. If your core is lose, chances are, you'll get hurt or it will just be much more complicated than it needs to be.
Point your foot in your shoe. This will help you stabilize yourself for barre and center work. When you're en pointe, that doesn’t mean that your foot is truly pointed. Think about pulling up and out of your shoes.

, If there is one way to make sure you will fall, it is relaxing your muscles. To keep your foot pointed, work your Achilles tendon and flex your calf muscle. To keep your leg straight, engage your quadriceps. To lengthen and extend the leg, use your hamstrings. To turn out, use your hip flexors and your glutes. To balance, use your abdominals. To keep good posture, pull down in your back muscles.

, When it's your first class you may only last ten minutes before some pain sets in. If you experience numbness, tell your instructor right away so you can take off the pointe shoes. How you can also tell if you should stop is every minute or so to make sure blood is still flowing through your toes and your toes still have feeling in them.


Don’t sink in your pinky toe. This is known as sickling. It is really bad for your feet, ankles, and knees and makes dancing harder, not to mention potentially causing serious injury. Keep your weight in the middle of the box, on your big toe.

, Your feet will probably be sore or numb afterward. The pain will decrease after a couple weeks. Soaking your feet in warm water is good for your feet because it relieves tension and relaxes the feet. Do not go for a foot spa or remove your callouses, since you need them on your feet, which help in pointe work. Use a stress ball or footsie roller by Bunheads to massage your feet.


After class, put baby powder on your feet to soak up the sweat and do the same with your padding. Always keep your toenails to average length (not too long nor too short-- which can be very painful)
Let your pointe shoes air out because if you don't they will soak up the sweat and break faster. Remember that pointe shoes only last up for a few months or years, depending on how often you use them. For professionals, they usually go through numerous pairs in just a few months or even week/s.

, There are many ways to work out your feet so that you have more strength for your next class. You can do relevés, jumps and even just pointing your toes.


It is nearly impossible to force turnout en pointe so you need to have strong turnout ahead of time. A suitable exercise for readying yourself for turnout is the frog stretch.
Ankle strength is the most important thing if you don't want to get hurt. Do some relevés at the bar before class.
Soften (bend) your knees slightly when doing pointe work.

, Concentrate on working your feet and legs and pointing to the maximum. Engage everything. It will be easier to point your feet in pointe shoes if you have that extra strength gotten from practicing on your own.

, Don't stop taking regular technique classes just because you are on pointe. Pointe work alone will not improve your overall ballet technique. Regular classes will give you much more strength to help with your pointe work!

, Most of all, listen so that you can become an amazing dancer!

Meet the body requirements.,
Wear the proper clothing.,
Go through training.,
Hire a teacher to teach you privately (do this if you wish to take your dancing further).,
Analyze lead dancers (principles, soloists) from corps de ballet members (""background dancers"" in a company) and students and see what makes them different.,
Gain experience as a performer.,
Get extra home training.,
Have a good mind.",How to Become a Ballet Dancer," Anybody wishing to become a ballet dancer needs to meet some requirements.


Have a strong core, back, feet, and legs, a flexible body, be a graceful person when dancing, and be relatively healthy. You should also be at a healthy weight. You do not need to have all of these qualities to begin ballet, but having all of them would be helpful if you wished to become a professional ballet dancer. Dancers are strong and flexible at the same time.;
, Having the proper clothing can be a big boost. Not only does it make you look like a pro, but some items will help support you, allow you to move, and even help with certain ballet techniques such as pointe shoes.


For many schools, the basic uniform for girls is a leotard, tights, a Georgette skirt (thin cloth wrap-around skirt), and soft ballet shoes (leather or canvas). Once you become more advanced, your teacher may allow you to begin wearing pointe shoes, and train to become proficient at pointework. This is a skill vital for professional ballerinas.


Do not wear these before you are told, as these can do serious damage to your toes, feet and ankles.



, This will be the hardest step if you are not already familiar with the ballet world, but many people have overcome it.


When choosing a school, make sure that the directors are experienced, most likely having danced professionally before. See if any of their graduates have gone on to professional companies.
Make sure that the directors are reasonable: there are many teachers out there who will stop at nothing to try to make their students perfect dancers. It is simply not reasonable. Being in training for a professional career is stressful; you don't want a teacher who is going to increase that stress.

, Nearly all big cities will have a ballet school, i.e Boston Ballet School. Enrolling in these is for the experienced and can be expensive, but will look good for your future.


Just having a good teacher or two isn't going to turn you into a ballet dancer. You need to do everything properly as to minimize the risk of injury. Research how your body works in response to ballet (anatomy, etc.), imagery in ballet, and other things that help you get a better sense of your body.

, What do they do differently? How do they do it? Why? These and more are all questions you should ask yourself and apply. You don't have to do things single-handedly. There are tons of things you can learn from.


Don't be afraid to develop your own ideas and opinions about your art form. Besides knowing these things, you also have to put it into practice. Stay after class to do this if you will. While the other people dance and you are waiting for your turn, instead of talking or drilling, ask yourself what you can do to be better, more beautiful, more artistic... whatever. Know, then apply.

, This is a very important step, as most schools have recitals in which their students can perform.


If you wish to take your performance level further, you may want to look into competing in solos in competitions, such as the Youth America Grand Prix. It is also helpful to train with a different teacher occasionally, perhaps in a summer workshop. Sometimes you can get different corrections or inspiration from another teacher besides your usual teacher.

, Ballet trains your muscles in specific areas and ways, so it is important to ""cross-train"" so you don't injure yourself by being unbalanced. Try yoga, swimming, pilates, hip hop, bike riding, hiking, or whatever else is fun.


You need to supplement things like yoga to make you strong, but you also need acting and artistic skills because you are ballet dancing. You can't go onstage and perform tricks, as there is no art in that. You have to have feeling. Try acting in plays, art classes, gardening, etc.
Even though it is good to work hard, you should also try to find time to rest and take a break from dancing. You don't want to get burned out.

, Think of ways you can advance to the next level.


Just having good technique means nothing if no one sees you. ""Summer Intensives"" are a good place to start. These are summer ballet camps organized by major companies.
You must always be willing to learn a new thing, or an old thing in a new way. Get to know your teachers. Don't annoy them too much, but familiarize yourself with them.
Remember that no one is beneath you. If there was a more senior member who thought you to be beneath you, think about how you are feeling. Plus, if she suddenly wanted a favor or something from you, you would not give it to her. Do not be that type of person.
There are some ballet competitions formed to expose dancers to the directors of major ballet schools, and performing at these could be a way to get a good scholarship to them. However, with the bonus comes the added risk. Ballet is a performing art, not a competition.
Remember to make friends with everyone to broaden your horizons. This is a very important step. If you must move away from your family at 15 or 16 to increase your chances in you career, or if you wish to do so, do it.
At this point, things are subjective. Everything depends on your choices, just as if you were a junior in high school. Think about what you would be doing.

For instance, if you become a biochemist, you would be researching and applying to colleges, studying as much as you can, etc. It is important to be seen and get your name out there.


Try to get inspiration whenever you feel unsure.

Start at an early age, if possible.,
Get in shape.,
Prepare for costs.,
Adopt a healthy diet.,
Practice.",How to Be a Ballerina1," Becoming a ballerina takes years of dedication and training. Ballerinas often start their career paths very young. As dance is an art form that takes a great deal of practice, professional ballerinas train for years before becoming professional. At 21, most ballerinas are already well into their professional career.If possible, begin training to become a ballerina in early childhood.


Many ballerinas begin taking classes at local community centers in early childhood. However, if you're older, you can still try to get into ballet. Look into affordable dance classes in your area.
Keep in mind that most professional ballerinas do start very young given that your career starts in your early 20s.;
, Dance is a very physical craft. If you want to become a ballerina, you'll have to be in peek physical shape in order to compete with professional dancers.


Being ""on pointe"" refers to standing on the very tips of your toes. While it looks graceful and easy, it's actually incredibly painful and requires a lot of skill. The tips of ballerina shoes are cushioned by blocks of wood, making standing on pointe physically demanding. As a ballerina, you'll need to develop a high pain threshold.Pilates is a workout routine which uses movement, strength training, and stretching to achieve long and lean arms and muscles. If you want a dancer's body, incorporate Pilates into your workout routine. Join a Pilates class or look for Pilates routines online.Cardio is also important for dancing. You'll need an incredible amount of physical endurance if you want to be a professional dancer. Strive for at least 30 minutes of cardio each day. Cardio includes things like jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, and other activities. You can also find cardio routines to do at home.Strength training is also necessary to become a dancer. To stay lean but strong, use light weights with high repetitions. For example, use a weight light enough that you start struggling to complete the exercise after 18 to 20 sets instead of 8 to 15., Becoming a ballerina is not cheap. You have to consider cost of training, cost of supplies, and cost of travel as you move from place to place for auditions and shows. You may have to put a lot of money into the craft before it will start to pay off. Even casual dancers will need to put a great deal of money into supplies.


If you want to go pro, you'll need to attend ballet school. Tuition for top-tier ballet schools is pricey. As training starts young, many ballerinas end up in training programs on and off for 15 years. This can add up to $53,000 in tuition. There are also additional fees that go into ballet school, such as cost of registration forms and costumes. Over time, these can add up to $2,000.However, if you just want to become proficient in ballet for your own satisfaction such training is likely unnecessary. You can cut costs by taking ballet lessons at a local dance studio instead of spending money on a separate school.
Many ballerinas take summer workshops in middle school, high school, and college. Over time, these can add up to $32,000.If you're not aiming to go pro, you do not have to take a workshop at every opportunity. However, it might be helpful to take a few workshops during your early education to gain additional training.
Ballet shoes are expensive and wear out over time. Over a seven year period, you may end up spending $29,000 on pointe shoes given that, especially early on in training, they need to be replaced roughly every 3 months. Other supplies, such as leotards and tights, can cost $2,000 over 15 years. Even people dancing for their own pleasure will need to spend money on supplies., Ballerinas need to maintain a certain weight in order to compete. This means adopting a healthy diet that gets you all necessary nutrients with fewer overall calories.


The majority of your diet should contain fresh, raw foods and whole grains. These includes things like nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and whole wheat breads, rices, and pastas.Packaged and processed foods should be avoided. They often contain empty calories and may also be incredibly high in sodium, which can lead to weight retention.Talk to a doctor about the diet you'll need as a ballerina. You want to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients.

, Dance is an art form that requires perfection. Ballerinas complete routines with a certain level of mastery in order to move up in the world. If you want to be a ballerina, you'll need to practice frequently in order to compete. Practice can be grueling and painful, but you must be prepared for a lifetime of hard work if you want to become a ballerina."
"
Enroll in a training program between ages 6 and 11.,
Spend summers and breaks in dance workshops.,
Decide on college or open classes.,
Get an apprenticeship.",How to Be a Ballerina2," Many professional ballerinas start training programs young. Summer workshops and boarding schools often provide the opportunity to learn the art of ballet. If possible, try to enter a training program between the ages of 6 to 11.


In order to be accepted into the most prestigious ballet programs, you need to audition. Therefore, try to get some prior training in via ballet lessons before attempting to enter a program.Auditions can be intense experiences. Students audition in groups and are then given the news as to whether or not they'll be asked back for a second audition or a mini training program to assess whether they'll be admitted into the school. If you do not make it one year, you can usually compete again at the more competitive programs.Training teaches the basic underlying skill set behind ballet. Ballet schools do offer basic academic, such as English, math, science, and history, in addition to dance classes. In some schools, classes are very small. This can allow teachers to provide students with more individualized attention., A full training program is not realistic for everyone who wants to become a ballerina. If this is the case for you, consider taking summer workshops and spending other breaks from school in dancing programs. You can take classes in your area and ask your instructors for advice on what affordable workshops you can take during summer, winter, and spring breaks. While this may sound less intensive than a full training program, many professional dancers are successful enrolling in a regular public school and doing workshops over breaks., As you get towards the end of high school, you need to think about where to go next. You can enroll in a college program that teaches dance, but you may be better off taking open classes with dance companies if you are invited to do so. As most professional dancers begin their career very young, many go straight into the professional world and put off college for a few years.


Open classes are dance classes at respectful studios. If you're invited to take open classes, you'll have the opportunity to dance in front of company directors without undergoing a formal audition. If you work hard at open classes, you may get an offer to train or apprentice with a professional dance company.If you want to attend college, many schools offer rigorous dance degrees. Top-tier colleges are very competitive, so work hard on your routine for auditions. You should also strive to keep your grades up and score high on standardized tests as you'll need to meet the basic academic requirements of a college as well., An apprenticeship is very important if you want to become a professional dancer. It's essentially your foot in the door to professional performances and steady work. Is an entry-level position in which you act as an understudy, training all day in the event you'll need to perform on stage. You can audition for apprenticeships after college. You may also be noticed at open classes and asked to be an apprentice for a company."
"
Audition.,
Tour.,
Prepare for a grueling schedule.",How to Be a Ballerina3," As you continue in your career as professional dancer, you'll need to learn how to audition. Auditions can help you lead roles in dance companies as well as individual performances. If you want to make money as a professional ballerina, you'll need to move to a bigger city like New York in order to succeed.Be Happy After Losing a Competition.


Make sure to enjoy yourself as your audition. Love of the craft is necessary to succeed in ballet and a panel will want to hire a dancer that conveys passion on stage. Even though the event will be stressful, try to enjoy dancing.Find ways to show your personality. Being yourself can help set you apart from other dancers. If you're allowed to select your own routine, pick moves that capture your unique personality.Try your best not to panic on stage. If you make a minor mistake or misstep, how you recover from that in audition speaks volumes to your skills as a dancer. Try to stay calm and keep going even if you screw up during a routine.Even low-stakes local performances have an audition process. Even if you just want to perform for fun, you'll likely have to audition at some point.

, If you're dancing professionally, you may be asked to tour with a dance company at some point in your career. This means moving from place to place for months on end with a group of other dancer. Make sure you're prepared for this commitment.


Camaraderie is important to ballet. You'll be living with, touring with, eating with, and performing with a core group of dancers. You need to learn to get along with others. Try to form solid bonds with anyone in your dance company., Being a professional ballerina takes an incredible amount of work. Schedules are long and the physical and emotional demands are intense. If you want to become a professional ballerina, prepare for a tough schedule.


Oftentimes, ballerinas end up enduring 10 hours of physical exercise each day. You may take class at 9 am and spend the remainder of the day rehearsing for shows. You'll need to work on maintaining a good sleep schedule to have the energy required to be a professional ballet dancer.On performance days, your schedule will be even longer. You'll need to get up earlier to rehearse and then go to bed later. A dancer's life can be somewhat lonely at times because there's little room for socialization. However, many dancers from close-knit bonds with other professionals."
"
Be realistic if you want to dance professional.,
Prepare for injuries.,
Have a back up plan.",How to Be a Ballerina4," Professional dancing is an incredibly demanding, competitive line of work. You need to be realistic about your chances at success. Even if you do all the right things and work very hard, you may not make it professionally. You need to prepare yourself emotionally for not making it., Injuries are common in the world of professional and amateur dance. Ballet is a highly physical art and you may end up with sore hips and ankles. Some injuries may prevent from dancing for a certain period of time. Talk to a doctor throughout your dancing career in order to make sure you're taking care of yourself. While injury can happen to anyone, taking care of your body through adequate stretching and rest can make it less likely., As stated, the world of professional dancing is grueling. After a certain point, you may need to accept that you'll need an alternative career route. In college and high school, take coursework in subject areas that interest you. Look for internships in fields outside of dancing. You'll need to work on honing a skill set that goes beyond professional dance in case you need a backup plan.

Find out why you might want to become a professional ballet dancer.,
Once you know why you are thinking about a career in ballet dancing, judge your reasons.,
If you haven't taken ballet, don't assume just yet that ballet is what you want do.,
Question yourself if you really do love ballet.,
If you have friends or relatives that are, have been, or are aiming to be ballet dancers, talking to them is a great idea.,
If you love ballet but just don't want a career out of it, then doing ballet recreationally is certainly fine!,
If you do think that you truly love ballet, great!,
Once you are sure you really do love ballet and want to become a professional ballet dancer, talk to your teacher about your goal.,
After you know that you ""have it"" to become a ballet dancer, audition for vocational ballet schools (if the time is right).,
Try to become the best dancer you can be, but, also the best person you can be.",How to Decide if You Want to Pursue Ballet Dancing As a Career," This might be hard to do, but try your hardest. You might not achieve this in years or even decades. If so, just move on, as long as you know you love ballet.;
, Wanting to inspire others is a great reason. Wanting to be famous is not - most dancers don't make the fame anyway. But, whatever your reason, you must love ballet. If you don't love ballet, you will find the hard work much more difficult, and it will be very easy to give up. If you don't love ballet, don't even think about this career.             

, Although it is possible that a career in ballet dancing is meant for you, you must know just how difficult ballet really is. As you move up in ballet, you might change your mind. You might also change your mind when you move to a vocational ballet school or join a company. Even when studying ballet recreationally, make sure you find a studio with a professional environment, with well-qualified teachers. This way, it will be more likely that you do steps that are age appropriate and suits what you need, and it is easier for you to learn good habits early on.

, Are you willing to leave family at a young age so you can go to a vocational ballet school? Are you willing to study dance for four to six plus hours a day as a student? Dance for about twelve hours as a professional? Don't just go ""OF COURSE!"" without thinking. You will become exhausted. A day at a ballet school is much longer than a day at regular school. There will be times when you think you just can't go on. There will be times when you feel frustrated, angry at a teacher, hurt. Keep in mind that you will likely have about four or five hours of academics a day as well. If you think you can thrive in these circumstances, then go for it! Audition for vocational ballet schools if the time is right and you are ready to do so. You may not get accepted to any of these, so it is a good idea to spread your options open. However, if you are currently in a recreational program or even in a vocational program but are thinking about another vocational school, talk to your teacher to see which schools are best for you.

, Talk to them about the path and life of a ballet dancer. Don't just hear - actually listen and understand. Then you will be one step closer to deciding if you really want this hard and intense life.

, Dance because you want to, not just because it's going to be your career! The sentence before applies to pre-professional students, too.

, However, even with the passion and drive for ballet, without the body, facility and musicality for ballet, becoming a ballet dancer is very unlikely. Keep in mind: ballet is not a high-paying job at all, it is typically low-paying. Exhaustion and injuries are a part of this career. Often by late 20's or early 30's, ballet careers are over. You must also be willing to be criticised.         

, Try to get different opinions. If you find that the career of ballet dancing is not well suited to you, don't be discouraged. If you love ballet, you may still be able to become a ballet physiotherapist or a ballet critic! You might want to look into other dance forms as well - but remember that ballet is the foundation of all dance forms. Make sure you are taking at least 15 hours of ballet a week if you want to become a professional dancer in another genre and try to get into a dance/art school when your teacher says the time is right. If you find out you do have sufficient talent to become a professional ballet dancer, that's great, but remember you must put your talent into use! Use your talent to become the best dancer you can be.

, Prior to attending a vocational ballet school, you should have been training at a school where the teachers are former professional ballet dancers and doing an appropriate amount and variety of dance training for your age (unless you are of an age when you don't need prior training to be considered - 10/11 and under). Talk to your teacher(s) to see which schools are best suited for you. Remember that getting in and studying there is only the beginning. You have to do your very best so you have less chance of getting appraised out, and more chance of getting into a company.

, You want to be your best, inside and out. Learn, care and understand. If after your career as a dancer you become a ballet teacher, look back on your own path. Then you can understand better. It might be hard to do, because when it's your job, obviously you want to have enough money to survive, but caring and understanding is still tremendously important.

, Put your arms wherever they feel comfiest: bras bas, demi seconde or you hands on your waist.

, Point your toes, keep your head up, pull your tummy in, turn your legs out and stretch your knees. The key to an enormous jump is to do an enormous plie to begin with.

, This just exaggerates the move and makes it look more professional.

, Keep your arms still and a professional look on your face (a smile usually works!). Make sure the foot is pointed.

, Make a plie so as not to jar your body, and stretch. As tempting as it may be, when you plie, don't stick your behind out; it looks so bad!

, Make it look easy! Blowing your cheeks out and clenching your fists won't work! Imagine you're a swan, calm and tranquil. Keep your upper half of you body completely still.

Sport your new tutu.",How to Make a Tutu1," A classic tutu is made from tulle or another stiff, lightweight fabric. You can use any color, but make sure that it measures between 50–80 inches (127.0–203.2 cm) wide and 1–3 yards (0.9–2.7 m) long depending on the size of the wearer. You will also need a spool of ribbon in a matching color of choice.;
, Use a soft measuring tape around the waist (the narrowest part of your torso) or a bit lower and mark the number. This is the location where the tutu will sit, so measure accordingly.

, Use your measurement from around your waist to get the length of your ribbon. Add an additional 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) of length to the ribbon to create a tie for the finished tutu. Lay your tulle out, and cut it vertically into strips 2–6 inches (5.1–15.2 cm) wide. For a bigger, fuller tutu, use thicker strips. For a tutu that is a bit more flat, use thinner strips. The number of strips you cut will vary depending on how wide your waist measurement is and how thickly they are being cut.

, Take each strip of tulle and fold it in half, creating a loop on one end with two loose tails on the other. Lay the folded strip on top of the ribbon, with only a few inches of the loop end sticking out over the top. Then, fold the tail ends under the ribbon and pull them through the loop tightly, creating a knot over the ribbon.

, Work around the ribbon, pushing the attached tulle strips together tightly to create a bunched effect. Add all your tulle strips in the same fashion until the entirety of the ribbon has been covered except a few inches on each end - these will be used to tie the tutu on.

, Tie the ribbon around your waist with the excess ends, and voila! Your tutu is now finished. Enjoy your pretty new skirt around town or as the accompaniment for a costume."

",How to Make a Tutu2," For a tutu that you sew, you can use a bolt of fabric cut into strips or rolls of tulle ribbon. Any color can be used for your tutu, and the amount that you need will vary based on the width of your waist. You will also need to get a thin elastic measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) or smaller.

, Wrap a soft measuring tape around your waist or wherever you would like the completed tutu to sit. Make sure that the measurement is not too loose; loose elastic will fit strangely and look awkward on.

, If you are using tulle yardage, lay it out flat and cut strips of the fabric measuring between 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) wide. The wider the strips, the more full your finished tutu will be. If you are using a bolt of tulle ribbon, cut it into long pieces of equal length between 50–80 inches (127.0–203.2 cm) long. The Strips will be folded in half, so ½ the length will be how long the tulle is on your body from the waistband. Cut your elastic to meet the measurement from your waist.

, Fold each strip of tulle in half over the elastic band. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew the two tail ends together directly underneath (but not on) the elastic band.

, Add all your strips of tulle around the length of the elastic waistband, bunching them together slightly as you work. You may need to cut and add more strips of tulle if you begin getting low near the ends of the elastic.

, When you reach the ends of the elastic band, sew them together using a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. Adjust your tulle so that it gathers around the waistband evenly, and you’re finished! Enjoy your pretty new tutu and show off your sewing skills.,"

Finished.",How to Make a No Sew Tutu1," Use a soft measuring tape to find the length around your hips or waist. The location of your measurement is the place that the tutu will sit when finished, so choose accordingly. Additionally, decide how long you want your skirt to be by measuring from your waistband to the desired hemline along your legs.;
, The two required materials for a basic no-sew tutu are tulle and ribbon. Each can be in whatever color(s) you would like. Depending on the size of the wearer and the desired length of the tutu, you will need to procure anywhere from 2-7 yards (1.8-6.5 meters) of fabric.

, Take the measurement from around your waist and apply it to the ribbon. Add an additional 12 inches (6 inches for each tail end) of length to the ribbon. This will allow it to be tied together in a bow in the back. Tie the ribbon in a knot with the two 6 inch (15.2 cm) tails hanging out; this will make it easier to add the tulle and help you know when to stop adding the fabric.

, Measure your tulle into strips of fabric twice the length of your desired skirt. For example, if you want your skirt to be 15 inches (38.1 cm) long from the waist to the hemline, measure your tulle into strips 30 inches (76.2 cm) long. Cut about 20 of these strips to start, and cut additional pieces later if you run out.


For a fuller, fluffier skirt, cut many pieces of tulle into small, thin sections.To create a skirt that lies flat and not as fluffy, cut only a few pieces of tulle that are very wide.

, As you begin to add your tulle to the skirt, fold each strip of tulle in half. This should create a loop on one end and two loose tails on the other.

, Place the halved tulle strips over the waistband so that only a few inches of the loop stick out over the top. Then fold the tail ends around the waistband and pull them through the loop.

, As you pull the strips through the loop, tighten them and slide them down the waistband to make room for other strips. Keeping the tulle knots tight will stabilize the skirt and make it look more polished.

, Add more and more strips around the waistband to fill out the skirt. Push them close together for a more full skirt, or leave them more spaced apart for a skirt that is a bit more flat. Stop adding the tulle strips when you reach the end (the knot) of your waistband.

, To finish the tutu, untie the knot in the waistband and try it on for size! Wrap the skirt around you and tie the ribbon tails in a bow in the back to secure the tutu around your waist., This is a great accessory over a skirt, leggings, or a dress.

",How to Make a No Sew Tutu2," This is a material that looks like fabric lining in a tape shape. It can be found at almost every sewing shop. All you have to do is pin it into place and iron: the material melts and acts like glue.

, You'll want to avoid using tulle for this style. You want a fabric with fibers that are closer together, so that the glue of the seam tape has something to hold on to. Organza will work better with the seam tape and it still has the ballet look. It is, however, often more expensive than tulle.

, Cut panels of fabric that are as long as you want the skirt to be plus 2.5 inches (6 centimeters). The width depends on you: having wider panels makes for fewer visible gaps in the skirt, but having narrower ones makes the panels easier to add onto the waist band. How many panels you want is also up to you. You can add as many or as few a you want. The more you have, the more volume the skirt will have.

, Cut strips of the seam tape to the width of your panels. Then, fold over the top of the panel so that there is about 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) of overlap. Run the seam tape between the layers and pin it into place as close to the bottom edge as possible. You want to leave a channel at the top to run the waist band through.

, Follow the instructions for your seam tape and iron the seam of each panel.

, Using a ribbon or elastic band as a waistband, thread the panels onto the waistband one at a time. A pencil can help with this. When you like how full your skirt looks, just tie it on your waist like an apron! Enjoy!

Go en pointe when you're ready.",How to Ballet Dance," Stretching is important to loosen muscles, strengthen muscles and to elongate your posture. It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session, including before a performance. When taking on ballet, it is important to stretch daily for at least 15-30 minutes, to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up, reducing the risk of injury. You should also stretch to ""wind down"" at the end of ballet dancing.;
, Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug, but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet. There are different styles and types of shoes, so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice, given your intentions for dancing.


Don't buy shoes to grow into, because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat. You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose. If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail. The drawstring just completes the fit. It isn't made to tighten overly large shoes.
If you can't buy ballet shoes, that it is okay. Use socks without the stickies on the bottom, so you can turn!

, The most important thing is that you are comfortable, and that you're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you're forming and moving correctly in the mirror. A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet. Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate.


If you're signed up for a class, check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school. Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts. Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on.

, Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them. The moves themselves are relatively straightforward, but the positing, the timing, and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice. For this reason, it's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor, who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you're dancing properly. A dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you're doing accurately, and a barre for practicing.If you want to practice at home, make sure you've got enough open space to move freely, preferably on a hard wood floor. The back of a chair can replace the need for a bar. Position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you're doing.

, At the barre, you learn the basics of ballet that will be important as you progress. If you're just getting started, an entire dance practice should involve barre work. This is vital for building your strength, agility and flexibility, so do not see it as wasted time. If you skipped this, you wouldn't be able to dance. Even professional dancers begin each class at the barre.

, The fundamental cornerstone of ballet, and the basis from which all your more complicated moves will be developed are the five starting positions (and the ""parallel position"" which some consider the sixth position). You won't be able to learn to do anything else until you practice, perfect, and make automatic the six beginning positions. These should be so ingrained in your muscle memory that they're part of your DNA.


All positions should be practiced either facing the barre or with your left hand on the barre. Beginner dancers usually start facing the barre, and intermediate or advanced dancers usually start with the left hand on the barre while practicing positions.

, In the first position, your feet should be turned out from your body, and held together at the heels. Your legs should be straight and kept together, your back should be straight and your head held high. Maintain excellent posture and balance.

, In second position, your feet will have the same angle as in first, except that your feet should move so they are about shoulder width apart. Widen your base of support, but maintain the same posture and poise when in second as when you're in first. Practice transitioning from first to second position without changing the angle of your ankles.

, To move into third position, bring your lead foot (usually your dominant foot, or the foot you use to kick with) behind your other foot. The heel of your lead foot should be even with the ankle strap on your other ballet slipper. Move your hips forward and maintain your balance. Your legs should be straight and your shoulders should be back.

, To transition into fourth position from third, move your lead foot back, spreading your weight in a backward direction, much as you did between first and second position.

, Here, the positions start to get slightly more complicated. To transition into fifth position, bring your other foot back toward your lead foot, bending your ankle so your heel is on top of your lead toe. Your knee should be flexed slightly, but your back and shoulders should remain very straight and balanced. Practice this transition frequently.

, Both of your feet are together, side by side, like parallel lines.

, Plies are like squats, performed in each of the different positions. There are two types of plies: grande plies and demi plies. Beginners do plies in the first and second position. Intermediate and advanced do them in all the positions except third and sixth.


To do a demi plie, you want your legs to form a diamond, essentially. Bend your knees and squat so your knee forms a perfect 90 degree angle with your thigh and your shin. You should support your weight on the balls of your feet, keeping your heels off the ground and flexing your calves as you dip.
To do a grande plie, you want to dip down much farther, so your thighs are almost parallel with the floor. You'll also dip your arm while you do this. As you practice plies, focus on keeping your back very straight and your posture secure.

, Tendus are essentially points and stretches with your lead foot. A typical tendu combination is tendu en cross, which means ""in a cross."" You'll basically stand in first position and point with your lead toe to the front, to the side, and to the back.


It's common to mark the floor with tape to help you learn. You want to step a full step in front of you, leading with your heel and bringing your toe to a point in front of you. The distance should be equal in front, to the side, and behind you.
The exact distance of the step will vary, depending on the dancer and the length of your leg. You want your tendu to turn your legs into a right triangle, your plant foot remaining straight and your lead foot going far enough bring your leg straight.

, Stand very straight, in either first or fifth position. You may face the barre or be sideways to it. As you progress, you will get strong enough to do it at center.


Lift one leg to the side or front, keeping it straight, as high as you can. Point your feet once your foot leaves the floor. Keep both of your knees very straight and maintain correct posture. It's important to not lift your hip or butt to get your leg higher. Always turn your leg out, never turned in.
Keep correct technique by slowly lowering your leg and standing in the position from which you started, usually either first or fifth.

, Make sure you are balanced by testing to see if you can let go of the barre. Keep your leg up there. This makes you stronger. Make sure you are not slouching or leaning your core towards or away the leg that you have extended.

, The next step in ballet training is dancing en pointe, which involves using pointe shoes and balancing yourself on your toes. It's one of the most challenging and exciting parts of ballet study, and it needs to be done with the aid of an experienced instructor. This is typically done after four or five years of intermediate to advanced ballet study.


You should never dance en pointe without your teacher's permission! In most ballet schools teachers will not want you to even go en pointe at home. This is because without experience, you may strain your toe and feet muscles. Try going en pointe for small durations of time first, and then slowly work your way up.

After maintaining your arch, don't think you're done!",How to Master Your Foot Arch for Ballet," Also, try waking up your toes by trying to make them go apart and stretching them. Try doing anything that makes your feet warm enough, and your muscles not as tight, a bit loose, ready for action. (You will feel if your muscles are awake).


Before doing any exercises, such as the splits, (or any kind of exercise), its important to warm up. So, when you do stretch, your joints and muscles will be relaxed and ready to improve.
When getting warmed up, it's easier to stretch and is more effective.
You don't want to hurt yourself, because your muscles might not be awake, and when your joints aren't quite ready, you might sprain yourself, or over-stretch a muscle, which is very dangerous, especially to a ballerina.;
, You can do this by finding a low surface close to the ground. (Such as the bottom of a couch.) etc.


Find something that is close to the ground, somewhere you can put your feet under.
Carefully, with your knees bent, slide you toes under the opening. (Make sure to cover half of your foot.)
When your foot feels comfortable, slowly unbend your knee. Note: be careful, if you don't feel the stretch, try moving your foot more in, or in a different position.
Be very careful and patient. If you feel a stretch, that's okay. However, if you feel a pain of any sort, stop! Go as far down as you can, without feeling bad pain. This will stretch your arch greatly. (Don't push yourself too hard, to prevent injury).
Keep your foot under for as long as you can.
Watch TV, play on your iPad, or do homework, to entertain yourself while stretching.
Take quick breaks, to walk around the room, and let your foot become pain free.

,


Buy a foot roller, or, get a ball of some sort, or an object that is comfortable to roll your foot on.
Roll your foot on it, especially near the arch.
Do this for 5-20 minutes, or even more!

, Foot stretchers are expensive, and could be anywhere from 30-70 dollars. You can always create your own! (Or follow Step 3!) The method resembles a foot stretcher.

,


If you have a naturally flat foot, don't worry! Making your arch beautiful is hard, and long work!
Be patient, and don't push yourself over the limit, you don't want to outstretch a muscle, or hurt yourself badly. (You can end up in the hospital, or worse, a broken bone! This will slow you down even more!)
Practice every day, and take pictures or a time lapse to see your improvement!

,


Many people don't understand that safety comes first! Be careful when attempting any of these! (you don't want a bad injury, do you?)
Make sure you have the proper diet. Eating healthy things, and drinking milk is important, because they strengthen your bones. (make sure you aren't allergic to the food you eat!)

,


Sit down
Make the leg you want to check, (only one at a time) straight in front of you, while sitting down on the floor.
Make sure your knees are straight, and that your whole leg is straight.
Now, arch your foot.
If your toes touch the ground (while your leg is straight) then congratulations! You have officially mastered your foot arch! If your toes don't touch the ground, you still have some work to do! But don't worry, you will get there!

,,, (You might want to make a list of these, so you can do them everyday!)

,, There are many more steps to becoming a graceful ballerina, such as good turnout, balance, strengthening the leg muscles, upper back, flexibility, etc.

Classical ballet is the first type of ballet created. It is usually performed with a ballet slipper or pointed shoe. Its origin is from the Italian Renaissance courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth century. It spread to the court of Catherine De’ Medici. It was then more developed. Louis XIV founded the Academie Royale de Danse (Royal Academy of Dance). It was later altered to a concert form of dance in France and Russia. This ballet is extremely technical form of dance.
Neoclassical ballet obeys both classical techniques in ballet vocabulary. On the other hand, it strays away from classical ballet because it usually has fast tempos. The spacing in neoclassical ballet is more modern based than classical ballet. The unique structures define neoclassical ballet.
Contemporary ballet has been influenced by a combination of classical ballet and modern. It requires the technique of classical ballet, but allows a greater range of movement. It allows you to freely move without the strict body lines or turnouts.

A turnout is the natural rotation of your hips causing the knee and foot to turn outward, away from the center of the body. This ballet is usually done barefoot. George Balanchine is considered to be the founder of contemporary ballet.

;
,

Place the bottoms of your feet together (Your legs should form a diamond shape).
Without titling your head back, look straight up at the ceiling. (Focus on getting your knees to touch the ground. This will work on your turnout. Your turnout is a rotation of the leg, which comes from the hips, causing the knee and foot to turn outward, away from the center of your body. You lay on the floor to work on your turnout because gravity makes it easier for your knees to push against the floor. You will get a better stretch.)

,


Choose the hand of your choice.
With the palm of that hand facing the floor, place it in the space beneath the middle of you back, but above your tailbone. (That is the natural arch of your back)
As you continue to push your knees towards the floor, try not to make the arch of your back any larger. (You want to do this because once you stand up you will want to eliminate that arch. In ballet you want to have a straight, flat back.)

,


With the hand of your choice, still positioned, imagine being able to push your belly button into the floor. (The goal is to continue pushing your knees towards the floor while your back is flat against the floor.This is the position you want to aim for when you stand up. Because the floor hard it is giving you something to brace yourself against, helping you do get a straight alignment in your back. Get familiar with the feeling you get in your stomach and in your back.)

,
When you stand sideways next to a mirror it allows you to look over your shoulder and adjust your upper body to the position it had on the floor. (You want to aim for the feeling you felt in your stomach and in your lower back, on the floor.)

,


If your feet are not already in a parallel position, put your feet side by side.
Lift your toes from the ground and move your feet out so that your heels are touching. (You are to move from your hips and not from your knees.Rotating from your knees means you are forcing your first position and you can help yourself. Your first position is also your natural turnout.)

,

As you are still facing sideways, next to a mirror, notice your natural arch in your back.
Move your tailbone down pointing towards the floor. (The goal is to have a flat back. Your buttocks’ muscles may feel slightly tightened, but they need to be tightened to allow you tailbone more room to point towards the floor. You do not want to hunch over while straightening you spinal chord through elongating you tailbone.)

,

Tighten your abdominal muscles. (They help you to support your spinal chord.)

,

Push your shoulders back and lift your chest up towards the ceiling as oppose to out towards the wall.
Imagine your shoulders with unbearable weights on them and then drop your shoulders.

,

Lift your chin slightly so that your head is not facing down. (Do not lift your entire head to the ceiling because after a while your neck will begin to hurt and it is also incorrect.You are only to do that if a choreographer tells you to.)

Ask a friend or family member to take pictures for you as you dance.,

Repeat with another pose.

,

, Use your arms in the pose as well as your legs. Take a few photos of the pose.

, Note all the little and/or big things you are not quite doing accurately or well so far. Note what you are getting right.

, Try the same pose again, making sure to try to fix those little errors you found before.

, Compare the photos from before with the photos from post practice, to see how much you have been able to improve. Make sure to take pictures from different angles.

,, This is the most useful and reliable way to know whether or not you've improved over time. Only your teacher can give you the overall picture of how you have been progressing within a set period of time and whether she or he believes that you have made sufficient progress to move onto another stage of learning.


Listen to what your teacher has to say. He or she will have some very constructive advice as to ways in which you can continue to improve, such as practicing more, doing strength exercises or focusing on specific errors that you might be making.
Ask your teacher whether it's possible for you to spend more time fixing particular errors or weaknesses during class sessions. Ask for specific exercises that might help.

, Ultimately, a dancer should be in tune with her or his own body. It is best to become self aware about changes in your body's ability to cope with ballet steps and routines, and to be aware of gaining strengths and improving. This will set you in good stead if you intend to continue with ballet as a career or a lifelong form of fitness.

, Use how you respond to this to gauge how you are improving in your ballet learning as a whole. While it should be challenging, as all new steps and exercises require learning and practice, if you find it is too difficult, then you may not be ready to move on to the next stage. On the other hand, if you find the new steps and routines hard but doable, then it's likely that you have improved enough to move forward to new things in your ballet learning.

Learn the basic ballet positions:










First: place your heels touching together and your feet facing in opposite directions.,
Find or make a barre.,
Read about ballet.,
Practice your positions.,
A good exercise is pas de chat ( step of the cat )said: pa-duh-shah: you just jump and point your feet one by one at your leg, or you can do change ,said: by Shonjemoh: when you put your right foot in front and your left foot in the back turned out and you just keep on jumping and changing them!








,
Find a class.,
Participate in the class.",How to Learn Basic Ballet Moves," Make sure your legs are turned out right from your thighs, not just below your knees or you could get serious knee injuries.

Second: like first, but place your feet about a foot apart. Keep the toes turned outwards.

Third: This position is like first, but cross the front foot's heel at the middle (instep) of your back foot.

Fourth: place your feet turned outwards, but place your front foot about six inches in front of your back foot. This can be done from first-open fourth; or from third; crossed fourth.

Fifth: similar to first, but you place your front foot's heel at your back foot's toe.;
, A barre is simply a rail to help you keep your balance when doing warm-up exercises. It should be at a comfortable height, just above (or at) your waist.








, The more that you read, especially books with illustrations or photos, the more you will feel comfortable with the different positions, the styles and techniques. It is also very useful to read about famous ballerinas and ballet dancers to understand their techniques and artistic backgrounds. Not only will these inspire you but they will also provide you with ideas for creating your own style. Also, try watching videos which instruct the basics of ballet. These are helpful as you can visually see the correct way to perform steps, and have audible instructions to make them as clear as possible.








, Do this daily - you are training your body for life. Even those who cease dance as adults tend to hold their bodies better than those who have never danced and retain a high level of flexibility and body awareness. So, even if you do not go on to make a career of ballet, you are doing your body a good turn. Just make sure you hold your posture correctly during dance, or you may well damage your body instead of doing it good.








,, You need a ballet teacher to help you know if you are doing it correctly. This is very important as there is only so much you can teach yourself at home off the internet or from a book. Get a good teacher; keep looking until you feel a ""click"" with the person teaching you.








, This is important because you won't know if you are doing it right if you don't participate. Take all criticism constructively. You will never learn anything if you aren't told how you are doing something incorrectly.

Learn à la quatrième devant or en face devant, which means a tendu front facing the front wall, or audience.,
Learn effacé (devant), which translates to ""shaded"", creating an open line.",How to Learn Body Positions for Advanced Ballet1," The audience should see a crossed line with the leg or foot placed in front of the body. To perform a tendu croisé devant, place your right foot in a tendu front facing corner eight, and the left in a turned out position, toes to corner six. Place your arms in high third, with the left arm up (high fifth) and the right in second. The head should be open, and looking out towards the audience, or your right arm. Your teacher may also ask you to tilt your head slightly to follow your line.;
, Take a tendu front, facing the audience, and bring your arms into second. Look forward and keep your head upright.

, Demonstrate a tendu effacé devant by facing corner eight with your left foot front. Take a tendu devant, and place your arms in high third wit the right arm up. Use your head by looking just past the wrist of the upper arm.

Incorporate the head by turning the face to look at the palm or wist of the upper arm.

, Face the front, and with the arms in second, tendu the right foot to the side.

, Perform this position by facing corner eight with the right foot front. Tendu the left foot out to the side, towards corner six. Put your left arm in high fifth, and your right arm in second. Look down over the right arm, and if your teacher allows it, tilt slightly towards the open arm.

Bring everything in at once.,
Once you have those three moves down, do a pirouette.,
Establish your one-legged relevés, ensuring you can do thirty-two comfortably in a row.,
Staying planted on your relevé foot, practice the out, around and inward foot movement with your free leg.,
Focus on your supporting leg to stay in place, not the swinging leg.,
Use the swing to the side to build your momentum.,
Coordinate the extension of your hands with your leg kick.,
Keep your chest up and open to spin easier.",How to Do Ballet Fouette Turns," If you don't have a barre, you can use the wall -- or even a banister! Just have something you can return to for balance.;
, For the record, that means your right foot is brought to your left knee, right knee facing outward -- that's the passé part. Relevé is where you are up on your toes. We'll be working with your right being your working leg, obviously.


In this position, hold the bar with your left hand. Keep your core tight, pulling up your ribcage and keeping your hips down. Your right arm should be in the first position.

, Your arm stays in first position and your hips stay down. Plié is to bend your left leg slightly at the knee, making sure to keep your knees over your toes. To developé to the front, point your right toe stretched out in front of you at a 90-degree angle.

, Your arm opens to the second position as well. You remain in plié, knees over your toes. Make sure to keep your hips down!

, Your arm goes back to the first position, your leg resumes passé, and you go back to relevé. Remember: core tight and hips down at all times!

, Plié and developé to the front, go to second, and then do a pirouette, staying at the bar. This is your basic fouette turn, but with training wheels. Once you feel comfortable here, you can do some floor work!

, A fouette is both a turn and a relevé at once, so if you can't handle the relevés just yet, you should work on building this leg strength and balance. Note that you don't always do 32 fouettes at once -- but if you can hit the maximum, doing less will be a cinch. A solid, balanced, strong relevé is essential. To do one relevé:









Put one foot on the ground, and the other slightly behind you.
Press straight up on your toes, standing up on the one foot.
Keep your hips moving only up and down, and your body straight.
Practice moving your free leg out and around (try a ""ronde de jambe"") and keeping your body balanced and still.

, Again, this is a smaller part of a fouette, not the entire thing, but you need to nail this movement if you ever want to pull off the full turn. Balancing evenly, not on your toes, of your right foot (right-footed dancers), practice the following three steps without tipping or losing balance. Your hips, in particular, should not move.









Lift your left leg straight in front of you.
Arc your left leg to the right, so that it points perpendicular to your body.
Bend at the left knee to bring your left toes to your right leg, the center of your body.

Your feet are in the fourth position.



, As you practice, work on making the extended leg second nature so that your attention goes instead to your plant leg. By centering yourself on the planted leg, you ensure you don't drift around the stage or lose balance as you get tired and keep spinning.









Remember to keep your hips in the same place. They should spin like a top on that supporting leg.

, Many young dancers will swing up, turn their leg a bit to the right, then immediately tuck in. But that kick sideways provides the bulk of your momentum and needs to be a major part of the fouette. Think of someone grabbing your foot and spinning it to the right to rotate you on that planted foot.








, As your left leg kicks to the right, your left arm should fly out with it. Think of your left hand and left foot as being tethered together on a string. This creates full body momentum, making it much easier to keep your balance.









As your toes come in towards the end of the turn, you pull your hands back in with them. Then they both push out afterward for the next spin.

, Use your hands to open you body up. Your shoulders should be up and chest out. When your hands come in, don't let your body crumple or cave inward. You want to be tall, strong, and on balance. The chest needs to be lifted to make this possible.

Learn the different ballet positions.,
Begin in first position.,
Bend with your toes.The demi-plié or half bend refers to the bending of the knees, so you need to lower yourself by bending at the knees.,
Keep your heels planted.,
Rise slowly and gracefully.,
Return to first position.,
Practice demi-pliés from other positions.",How to Do a Plie in Ballet1," There are five different foot positions in ballet, and you can perform a demi-plié (half bend) in all of them.This means that to perform a proper demi-plié from each position, you must first be comfortable with the basic positions.


Each position utilizes turn-out, which is the rotation of the leg from the hip joint.The objective is to have the heels and toes face perpendicular to the direction of the body rather than parallel.
Do not expect to perform a perfect turn-out immediately. Forcing turn-out can cause many injuries. Even some professional dancers do not have perfect turn-out after years of practice. In addition to each position having a different foot placement, each position also utilizes a different arm placement or port de bras.You can read more information on the different ballet positions at How to Do All Five Ballet Positions.;
, Though you can perform a demi-plié in any of the five positions, use the first position for initial practice. First position requires the heels be placed touching (or close to it) with your legs turned out as close to 180 degrees as you can manage.


You also want to have your legs and back straight.The turn-out should come mostly from the leg at the hip joint. Do not place excess strain on the knees or ankles by forcing each foot closer to 90 degrees than you can do normally. Use your muscles to keep your knees over the feet rather than the two being out of alignment.Initially your turn-out in first position will look more like a V than a straight line. A wider turn-out simply comes with practice.

, Your upper body should remain in the same position—shoulders down, head up, bottom tucked—throughout the movement.One of the most common problems with plié form for beginners is due to sticking out one’s butt while lowering as though lowering into a crouch. Don’t stick your backside out or adjust your hips, simply lower at the knees while keeping the rest of the body straight., Demi-pliés regardless of the beginning position require the heels to stay firmly planted on the ground.Do not bend so far that it forces your heels to come off the ground.


Rather than a deep bend, which is the territory of a grand-plié, you only want to bend your knees until they extend just over your toes.

, While ballet dancers do rise quickly out of pliés and use them as springboards for jumps and pirouettes, beginners should practice rising slowly and fluidly to help perfect the form. Rather than simply straightening your knees, you want to push your weight straight down into the floor with your legs and feet to push yourself back up.Using the legs and feet gives the motion much more fluidity, and it also places less strain on the knees.
Continue keeping your shoulders down, head up, and bottom tucked during the upward movement. The motion should look more like the upper body is elevating rather than standing up since the upper body should already be straight., To finish the demi-plié, you will continue rising until the thighs and knees and back together. You will return to first position the same as you were in before performing the demi-plié.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basics of a demi-plié in first position, you can try pliés from the other four ballet positions as well. They are harder, particularly in fifth position, so have patience and practice without rushing yourself.

, The supporting leg is the leg that says on the ground throughout the position. Do not turn out more than is comfortable or more than your hip allows.

, Shift your weight to the ball of your foot on your supporting leg. Your supporting leg should now be perpendicular to the floor.

, Your working leg is the leg that you will raise for the position. Straighten out and lengthen your working leg with the top of the foot flat on the floor behind you., Keep your shoulders and rib cage square with your hips. With one hand, hold onto a barre or chair for stability and balance, and lift your chest up and out.

, Balance on your supporting leg, feeling it stretch into the floor, and slowly lift your working leg behind you.


Be sure to straighten the knee of your working leg and point your toes.
Typically, the working leg sweeps out to a 45 or 90 degree angle, but if you are just beginning, don’t force your body into this position. Only raise your working leg as high as you are able while still maintaining a strong upper body.

, Still holding onto the barre, lean forward at the hips and engage your abdominal muscles. This movement mimics that of a hinge.


Remember to keep your supporting leg turned out.Elongate your spine and keep your chest lifted.

, Lower your working leg to the floor with the top of the foot flat to the floor. Straighten your upper body at hips and square your hips and shoulders to begin the position again.

, Before you start stretching cold muscles, warm up your entire body and increase your heart rate by jogging in place or taking a brisk walk. Jog or walk for about ten minutes, long enough to break into a light sweat.

, Reach your arms up above your head. Bend slightly at the waist to the front, side-to-side, and to the back in one fluid and controlled motion. Try this warm up with both legs on the ground. Then challenge yourself and improve your stability by repeating the exercise on one leg., Stand up straight and swing both arms in large circles, keeping the motion slow and controlled. While swinging your arms, gently twist back and forth at the waist.

, Lie on your back with your arms at your sides. Swing your legs up and down, alternating between your left and right leg. Your motions should be fluid and controlled.

, Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Bend forward, stretch out your arms, and reach for your toes.


Reach until you feel a slight muscle burn on the back of your thighs and calves. Hold this position for 30 seconds.
If you can’t reach your toes, don’t force your body into the position. Repeat this stretch daily, gradually working toward reaching your toes.

, Since the Arabesque requires your back muscles to be engaged throughout the position, a stiff back can make your Arabesque flat.Rotate your torso, swinging your arms gently from side-to-side. Switch from swinging your arms to gently swinging your legs back and forth, alternating between right and left.
Use a foam roller or pilates ball to ease tension from you back. Lie face up with a roller or ball under your upper back. Arms and head relaxing on the floor. Allow your body to sink into this position and hold for a minute. Move the roller or ball to your lower back and repeat the stretch.

, Lying on your back, straighten and raise your legs to a 45 degree angle off the floor. Lift your upper back off the floor until your shoulder blades are also lifted. Straighten your arms and raise them about 2 inches off the ground. Pump your arms up and down.Keep your top and bottom abs engaged throughout the exercise in order to strengthen your entire core.
Breathe in for five pumps, and breathe out for five pumps. Do the exercise 10 times for a total of 100 pumps.
Repeat this exercise daily to gradually strengthen your core.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward, hips over knees, and knees over ankles. Keeping your back straight and your arms outstretched in front of you, bend your knees forward and lower your hips. If you can, dip your hips below your knees. Straighten and repeat the motion 9 more times. Follow with 2 more sets for a total of 30 squats.While performing the squat, be sure that you don't let your knees go past your toes.
If you can’t dip your hips below your knees, don’t force the position. Squat as far as you can, and gradually build your strength to dip below the knees.

, Straighten your knees and slowly rise to the balls of your feet. Maintain smooth and controlled movement, while making sure weight is distributed between the first and second toe of each foot. Start with 10 to 15 repetitions with both feet, and gradually work toward 10 to 15 repetitions alternating between each foot."

Understand the difference between a demi-plié and a grand-plié.,
Assume first position.,
Bend at the knees.,
Lift your heels off the ground.,
Continue bending your knees until your thighs are nearly horizontal.,
Rise back to first position.,
Make all bending movements gracefully.,
Practice grand-pliés from other positions.",How to Do a Plie in Ballet2," Both demi- and grand-pliés refer to bending at the knees, and both can be done in all five ballet positions. The major difference between the two comes in the depth of the bend and how that has an effect on the placement of one’s heels.

, Once again, this example will use first position since it’s the most common training position for beginners.

, As with a demi-plié, a grand-plié requires you to bend at the knees; however, with a grand-plié you will not stop with your knees just slightly over your toes.

, Since you are bending further down at the knees in a grand-plié, your heels will naturally come off the ground.Even though the weight shifts to the forward parts of your feet entirely, your upper body should be perfectly straight, meaning your center of gravity should still feel as though you are standing with legs straight.The exceptions to this rule are when performing a grand-plié from second position. The wider stance of second position allows the dancer to descend fully while still maintaining floor contact with the heels of the feet., Once your heels come off the ground, you should have an easier time descending even lower in the grand-plié. Continue lowering as far as you can until your thighs are nearly horizontal and your knees are almost fully bent.As with a demi-plié, the upper body should be straight throughout the entire movement with the shoulders down, back straight, head up, tailbone dropped, and stomach tight., As with a demi-plié, you will return to your initial starting position—in this case first position. When rising, you once again want to use the feet and legs rather than simply the knees to straighten.


Push down with your raised heels to reconnect them with the floor as soon as possible in the rising motion., As with all ballet movements, every movement should be performed fluidly and gracefully without jerking. This can take practice.

, Once you feel comfortable performing grand-pliés from first position, you should begin practicing them from the other starting positions as well.

Start at the barre.,
Plie en pointe.,
Jump.,
Straighten your legs, and do it again.",How to Jump En Pointe," Go en pointe in fifth position, keeping both hands on the barre but not leaning onto it.;
, However, you're going to have to look very weird while doing so. Plie your legs, but not your feet. Keep your feet in the same position while bending your legs.

, Switch your feet like you do during a changement (jump from fifth to other fifth, or switching feet in jump). Land in the same position as you started, while en pointe and your legs in plie.

,


Once you get really good at it, turn around so that you are facing away from the barre and try this time. Now, you can't lean on anything, so it makes it harder.
Once you get good at that, try going into center. It is even more important that you are supervised during this step. Go slowly.

Put your heels together and spread your toes apart.,
With your arms, pretend that you are holding a beach ball with your arms all the way around it.",How to Do All Five Ballet Positions1," Your heels should make a ""V"" shape. Make sure to focus on rotating your hips out. However, if you have hyperextended legs you can open your ankles to a couple of centimeters apart if your knees touch. If you demi-plie in 1st, you should make sure you are not rolling forward over your feet. This will lead to severe injuries.;
, Your arms should make a circle, and they should rest about 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from your body.


Tuck your thumbs in and keep your fingers and arms long.

, Pretend that the penny got much bigger so that to try to get your arms around it, you have to open them wide so that they are over your feet.


Your arms should be at your sides, palms pointing forward, elbows slightly relaxed, and thumbs tucked in.

"
"
For the third position of the feet, place one foot in front of the other.,
Bring one arm into the coin position, but this time a little below your belly button.",How to Do All Five Ballet Positions3," The front foot should be touching the midway pointe of the back foot.


One foot should be in front of the other, with the heel of the front foot touching the arch of the back foot.

, Bring your other arm to the second position.


Keep the same arm of the foot that is in front to the side. The other arm comes rounded in front of the belly button, elbows rounded and relaxed.

"
"
Start from a fifth position.,
Keep the arm to the side the same.",How to Do All Five Ballet Positions4," From fifth position, move the front foot out a slight amount with about a foot of distance between them.


Fourth position with the legs is one of the main preparation for a pirouette or a ballet turn.

, Keeping the rounded arm in the same shape, lift it up above the head.


Forth position arms are one arm in the coin position, but just below the belly button, and the other above the head but forward enough that you can still see it. The high arm should also be in the coin position.

"
"
Place the toe of the front foot to heel of the back foot.,
Bring the other arm up to meet the high arm, keeping them rounded with the elbows relaxed and the thumbs tucked in.",How to Do All Five Ballet Positions5," Place the toe of the back foot to the heel of the front foot. Keep the knees to the sides of the room, and turn out from the thighs.


Fifth position with the legs is the same as third, but the front foot crosses over more so that the front foot toes and the back foot heel touch.

,


Fifth position arms are the same as the high arm in fourth position (step 8), but this time, both arms are high.

"
"
Try the sixth (parallel) position.,
Do preparatory position.",How to Do All Five Ballet Positions6," Although it is not used often, the sixth position is best described as the first position but with toes touching. The sixth position is also known as parallel position. The arms may vary from class to class, studio to studio, and so on.

, Turn one foot turned out like in the first position, and the other in a tendu back, but with your tendu knee bent and your knees touching. The arms are usually first position arms.

Take your shoes off after class and walk around barefoot to cool them down and loosen them up a little.,
Stand at the barre (if wearing convertible tights, roll them up) with your feet in parallel.,
When you get home from class massage your feet.,
After you loosen them up a bit, put your feet in warm, salty water to relax them.,
When you take your feet out pat them dry and put some skin lotion on them.,
Massage and bend your feet and toes forward and back to put some more movement in them.,
Preparing for your next time on pointe starts as soon as you get home.",How to Care for Feet After Being En Pointe," Feel for any abnormal pain to check you haven't injured yourself. Walking normally will get your feet back into 'normal mode', so you hopefully won't be walking around turned out.;
, Or get a can and lay in horizontal position. Roll through your demi-pointe a couple times, take a couple of plies, and a couple of tendus.Rolling helps to break up adhesions in the muscle.

, Start with your toes, since they'll probably be the most painful part of your feet after pointe class. Work your way through the balls of your feet, though your arch, and into your heel. Rub with a circular motion, and dig gently with your fingers to massage tendons, ligaments and muscles.

, Massage them again while in the water to help with the feeling of soreness. Leave them in the water while you watch television or read a book.

, It doesn't matter what brand it is, but lotions with aloe vera or other soothing or healing herbs in can really help mend your feet if they got cut or sore during practice. Arnica cream is good to use on bruising.

, Wriggle your toes about and tap out a rhythm with your big toe to restore your movement.

, Continue to work on the strengthening of your feet and ankles so that your next time on pointe is less painful and so you advance in your skill on pointe. It won't get better immediately since pointe is a hard skill to learn and it isn't kind on the body. The stronger you are, the easier pointe will be. Make sure you attend technique lessons in soft shoes as well as pointe training so your skill in ballet doesn't slip. Do another form of exercise as well as dance to improve your leg strength, like running or swimming.

Wear the appropriate footwear.,
Practice your retire position before you turn.,
Keep your ribs closed and your shoulders back.,
Check your hips.,
Arrange your feet in fourth position.,
Position your arms.",How to Do a Pirouette1," Ballet slippers, jazz shoes, turning shoes, are best for practicing pirouettes. You need something with good range of motion and support. Modern shoes, such as Capezio Foot Undeez or Dance Paws are also appropriate, which cover and support the ball of your foot. They're easy to slip on and great for quick practices.


You also need to practice pirouettes in a safe place, clear of any sharp objects or obstacles. It's always preferable to practice in a dance studio under supervision.;
, Your retire position should be perfect before you begin to turn, making it important that you learn to place your toe correctly and bend your knee appropriately.









Place your toe into the notch at the top of the front of your knee, staying careful not to over-cross the foot on the leg. You should feel support under your thigh, when you're positioned properly.

, Your shoulders should be directly over your hips. Straighten your supporting leg to keep your releve should be as high as possible, imagine yourself stretching up to the sky, and into the ground.

, Make sure your hips are not tilted to the back, or otherwise off-kilter. Imagine your hips were a fruit bowl. Would your fruit spill? A tilted pelvis can often lead to incorrect turns and eventually knee and back problems.


Make sure you have a strong plie prep but don't stay in your preparation (plie) too long, because then you will lose the momentum, making it difficult to pirouette.

, If you are turning to the right, your left foot will be in front, with your weight evenly distributed between both feet so that you can push off the back foot.








, Hold your right arm curved in front of you. Your palm should be facing your body with the elbow gently curved to the side, your arms rounded and out from your body as if holding a beach ball. Your fingers should be about level with the bottom of your rib cage. Keep your shoulder back.









Hold the other arm out to the side, palm forward and slightly below the shoulder. Keep the elbow in front of your body.

Be sure to have good balance before moving to another position. , Do this by sliding one foot about 12 inches (30 cm) forward and aligning your heels., You will do this by bending your knees while in the fourth position. Try to move gradually without jerks. Lower and rise at the same speed. This will help with flexibility and balance., Rise up on your toes or balls of your feet, from the fourth position, to be in the relevé position.


If you are a beginner rise to the balls of your feet, wearing ballet flats.
If you are intermediate or advanced, rise to your toes, wearing toe shoes., Slide the toe of one leg up the calf of the supporting leg to your knee to be in the passé position. The leg you move is called the working leg. Practice rising up on your toes in this position while using the ballet bar for balance., Hold your arms in front of you, rounded, at lower abdomen level. This is the first position and is essential for balance.

, Stand and choose a point on the wall or mirror, straight ahead at eye level, to use as a focal point. You can use a “post it” note if there is no point. You will look at this point during the entire dance move.

, Stand in fourth position with your feet about twelve inches apart. Bend both legs evenly in a plié.

, Rise up on your toes or balls of feet in the relevé position. Slide one foot up the other supporting leg to the passé position. This leg can be turned out facing the side (ballet) or parallel (jazz). , Hold your arms in front of you in the first position. Remember, this is essential for balance.

, Look at your focal point on the wall. Turn while in position, keeping your head facing the focal point for as long as you can and then whip your head around to continue focus while the rest of your body follows.


Your body’s steady movement and your head speeding up as necessary to focus is called spotting and helps prevent dizziness while your move remains controlled.
Push just enough to get around. Over pushing will throw the twirl off. , Land back in the fourth position to complete the pirouette. Try to land smoothly. While this may sound easy, you will need to practice to land in the right direction.

, You will need a very strong core to do multiple pirouettes in one motion. Do planks by holding your body stiff, in a pushup-like position, supported on your forearms. Hold for as long as possible. Aim to increase your time.
Do crunches. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent. Put your hands behind your head or across your chest. Flatten your lower back to the floor, while contracting stomach muscles and lifting shoulders off the floor about 2 inches (5 cm). Exhale when you come up. Lower your shoulders and repeat 20 times. Aim to increase the number of crunches over time., Dancing is very repetitive. Do exercises without impact.


Sit in a chair, lift your leg and do the alphabet with one foot and then the other.
Use a fitness band to do flex exercises. Put the band around one foot. Extend the foot while holding the band and slowly flex your foot in different directions.
Flex your calves in both the sitting and standing position. Strengthening muscles around the ankles will provide additional strength. , Multiple pirouettes is a very difficult move to master. Be patient with yourself. Remember, you love dancing and practice is the key to perfecting your art.

Bend your knees and push off the back leg.,
Point the retire foot hard.,
Focus on going up, not around.,
Spot yourself during the turn.,
Modulate force for number of rotations desired.,
Stick with it.",How to Do a Pirouette2," You should move into retire position on releve. At the same time, close your left arm into first position and bring the left side of your back around.









Make sure, while turning, you keep your hips stacked under your shoulders, there should be no curve in your spine. This will ensure better balance

, Imagine you're bringing that retire higher as you turn. This will also keep your center up and balanced. Make sure your foot is still connected to your leg.









Keep your supporting leg nice and straight, and don't sickle your feet. Sickling means that you let your ankle slouch and you lose your balance. Also remember to spot, so you don't get dizzy. Don't try double or triple pirouettes if you can't get a single down.

, Imagine someone is pulling you by a string on the top of your head. The turn will come naturally when you learn to go up. Focusing too hard on the spin causes inexperienced ballet dancers to tilt slightly, losing balance. Focus instead on going up and nailing the mechanics of the turn.








, As you are turning, look at a spot on the wall level with your eyes and as you rotate, attempt to keep it in sight at all times, you'll have to whip your head around to find it again with each rotation. This is called spotting.


Stop and return to fourth position. Your feet should be placed in the same position they were when you started.

, Before attempting multiple turns, try to balance at the end of a single turn before landing. More force generally equals more rotations, but it is also a timing thing. Too much force will send you careening across the room and you will lose control. Equally, too little power and you'll stop dead in your tracks and fall face first. The proper amount of power comes with experience and you'll soon be able to tell whether you have too much power or not enough.


For the first few tries, only attempt a single pirouette to familiarize your body with the feeling and motion. It takes time to work up to a double, triple, or a quad. You may even want to start with only quarter/half turns. If you try doubles/triples right away you will be disappointed.

, Remember, every ballerina has fallen on a pirouette at least once. Practice makes perfect. It doesn't take long to be able to do a pirouette and once you get the hang of it, it feels quite natural.

Stretch only until you feel a small burn in your leg muscles, and then hold it for 30 seconds.
If you are new to stretching, start slowly; take your time.
Do this stretch every day.;
, Kneel with both knees on the ground, but don't sit back. Extend your right leg forward until it is completely straight in front of you, with your heel on the ground. Lean down and place your fingers on the floor to either side of you. If this burns, hold this position. If not, scoot your heel forward until it does, and then hold. Repeat with the other leg.


Perform this stretch every day until your legs are both flat on the floor and you are sitting comfortably. But please do not push yourself while doing the splits, as you may injure yourself.
Allow yourself several weeks to reach a split. Go slowly and carefully to avoid a pulled muscle.

, Go into a right split with your right leg forward and your left leg back. Place one pillow beneath your right foot. Once the burn fades away, place a second pillow underneath it and hold. Remove both pillows and repeat for your back foot. Switch legs and repeat.

, Lying on your back, bring your knees upward so that your feet rest flat on the floor. Make sure to keep your stomach tight whilst straightening your right leg so that it points upward. Breathe out as you use your left leg to push your hips upward until your body is straight. Inhale as you lower your hips almost to the floor, and breathe in again as you push up. Repeat this in repetition 30 times.If you can't manage 30 reps, set a smaller number and gradually build up over several days.

, Begin on all fours, keeping your hands centered under your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Tighten your stomach as you breathe in and bring your right knee to your chest. Breathe out, point your right toe, and push your right leg out behind you and as far up into the air as you can whilst also bringing your chest upward.


Be sure you're using your glutes to achieve leg height.
Do 30 reps and switch legs.

, Start by jogging for around 15 paces, and then each time you take a stride, turn it into a leap. Focus on exploding of the ground as immediately and as far as possible on each jump. This is called bounding.Bound for around 30 yards (27.4 m), jog again, and then bound again.
Three rounds of bounding is ideal.

, If you are working from a specific combination or choreography, are you doing a right split jump or a left split jump? If not, try a right split jump just to start with.

, For our right split jump, this means your right leg is supporting you, foot flat on the floor and toe pointed outward. Your left leg is extended in front, straight, with your pointed toe touching the floor.

, Shift your weight onto your left leg keeping your knee bent outward, essentially forming a plie, while you shift your right foot along the floor to the front.

, Point your right toe as you bring your fully extended leg upward.

, Use your left leg to push as forcefully as possible off the floor. Push through your leg, the ball of your foot, and then even your toe to gain as much power as possible.

, While you are in the air, fully stretch your legs out in front and back, attempting to achieve your hard-earned split in mid-air.

, Bring your front (in this case, right) foot downward and land with your knee bent to absorb the shock. Keep your back leg and arms extended outward as they were in the jump.

, Bring your arms down as you pull your back leg down and through to point out in front as it did in the beginning.

Let yourself spin twice.",How to Do a Double Turn," Before attempting any double-spins or pirouettes of any kind, it's important to get loosened up to avoid injury. Warm up your neck, shoulders, arms, back, sides, and legs before dancing with a long stretching routine.









A nimble, loose neck will aid your equilibrium and balance when spotting and spinning. A loose torso will help you stay grounded and centered. Warmed up legs will provide the necessary support you need and reduce the possibility of cramping. The most important three body parts for a good turn are your neck, shoulders, and legs.;
, This side of your body will be referred to as your ""spin"" foot, and the corresponding leg, arm, and side will also be referred to as the ""spin"" side. The other side of your body will be referred to as your ""lift"" side.








, Begin standing with your spin foot in front of your lift foot, in a wide, balanced position, with most of your weight on your spin foot.









Place your spin arm at chest-height in front of you, with relaxed, bent elbow, so your spin forearm is parallel with your stomach.
Your lift arm should be extended directly out from your side, in line with your torso, not too far back or too far forward. The lift arm will provide the majority of your spinning power by swinging it in front of your body.

, This is your spot point. Keep your eyes fixed on this spot throughout the entire motion.









Practice spotting by stepping slowly in a circular motion in one spot. Keep your eyes on one spot at eye level, on the wall or landscape directly in front of you. Keep your eyes there until your turning motion forces you to spin your head.
If your head is level, the spotting motion will keep you from becoming overly dizzy or losing balance. Even with proper spotting, a slight dizzy feeling can be expected during a double spin. Minimize this by keeping your neck and shoulders loose, and turning your head in a full circle as quickly as possible. The faster your body spins, the easier it is to spot properly.

, Bring your lift knee up straight and point your toe as you push off, bringing it to the notch at the top of the knee on your spinning leg. This should somewhat resemble the 'jackknife' dive position.








, To carry your momentum around, you need to match the position of your spin arm, about chest-height, like you are holding a small beach ball to your stomach.








, Strengthen the upper thigh, ankle, and knee of your spin leg to create a rock solid pole on which to spin. Make a tiptoe shape with your spin foot, keeping your spin toes relaxed and responsive for fine tuning your balance during the spin.









Your spin point is the ball of your spin foot, which is the thick pad directly behind your toes. Do not spin directly on your toes. This is impossible and incredibly painful, no matter how convincing good ballet dancers look.

, Imagine all your weight forming a straight pole, from the ball of your spin foot up through your spin leg, through the center of your torso and out the top of your head. Just as a toy top has more of its weight at the top, so should your body.









It's important to think ""up"" instead of focusing on the spinning motion. Your momentum should work to carry you around, and focusing on staying as straight as possible and maintaining the proper form will help you balance.

, When you are heading on your second turn whip your head around, spotting twice. As you slow, return your lift leg to the ground and relax both arms out to your side at mid chest height to stop completely. Gently bring your feet back to the ground and let your momentum and weight slow you down naturally, coming to the ground.









The biggest difference between the double spin and the single spin is just the amount of force that you put on the turning step as you push off. It'll take some practice before you're able to do two, but stick with it and practice your spotting, and you'll get the hang of it eventually.

Take the gajra around the bun two or three times (till it looks sufficiently thick).
Attach the other end to the hair using a hair pin.
The gajra should feel tight and stay in place. Use extra pins wherever required.

Bobby pins, scrunchies, hair nets, hairbrush, hairspray, and hairbands.
Bandaids, toe tape (for blisters) and a small medical kit.
Water bottle and food. If allowed, keep dried fruit, bananas, or granola bars in your bag for times when you get hungry.
Clear nail polish. If you get a small run in your tights, coat it with some clear nail polish and let dry. It will stop the run in its tracks! It doesn't need to be fancy, cheap ones work fine. (It won't help much if the run is very wide, or very long. You have to get it the second it starts, or it's no good). It's also good to bring a sewing kit in case your leotard tears or the ribbons on your pointe shoes come off.

Gain some background information about Irish step dancing.,
Gather equipment.,
Do some simple drills.,
Learn the proper posture.,
Find a teacher.",How to Irish Step Dance," While it's not necessary, it is certainly helpful.


There are three types of shoes worn- girls' soft shoes, boys' soft shoes, and hard shoes. Boys' soft shoes and hard shoes resemble tap shoes, except instead of metal, resin is used. Boys' soft shoes also only have a tap at the heel. Girls' soft shoes resemble ballet slippers.
There are seven types of solo dances- Reel (2/4 or 4/4 time, soft shoes), light and single jigs (6/8 time, soft shoe), slip jig (9/8 time, soft shoe, usually girls only), treble jig (slow 6/8, hard shoe), hornpipe (2/4 or 4/4 time, hard shoe), and traditional set dances (time signature varies, hard shoe).
There are also Ceili (kay-lee) dances, which are danced in groups. They are in soft shoe, and there are dances for two, four, six, or eight people.;
, Since you're just starting out, just socks, gym shorts, and a t-shirt should be sufficient. Eventually, you'll need soft shoes, hard shoes, and additional equipment if you choose to perform or compete.

, To get a feel for Irish dance, try learning a few simple steps. Start slowly, and you can gradually get faster.


Singles

Hop on one foot, then step. Repeat over and over.


Doubles

These are like singles, except you step three times.
Think ""hop one two three""


Switches

Just switch from one foot to the other.



, Ideally, the top half of the body shouldn't move at all. Keep your arms straight at your sides and your shoulders pulled back, with your hands in fists.Keep your knees straight and turn your feet out, one foot in front of the other. Make sure you're up on your toes.

, If you've tried Irish dancing out and like it, why not get a teacher? There are Irish dance schools everywhere, even if you're not in Ireland!

Recruit dancers for your team.,
Auditions are a great way to determine who will and won't make the team.,
Come up with a name.,
Choreograph the moves for your dance.,
Rehearse.,
Try auditioning for a dance crew show.,
Get noticed.",How to Form a Dance Crew," There are several ways to do this:


Put up flyers. Depending on the age group and style of your dances, good places to put up flyers would be high schools, YMCAs and recreational centers, dance studios, and community centers.
Word of mouth or networks. Tell people about your dance crew. Let them know all the details and audition dates. Or, you may already know who you want to include in your dance crew!
Internet. The internet is an excellent place to recruit your dance crew members! Put up a video on YouTube, tweet about it, post it up on Facebook or;
, Set up a time and place (that has plenty of space), and bring along speakers, a CD player, and a few CD's. Remember- it's not necessarily about all the cool moves they can do, but if they have rhythm or potential.

, This could even be done before the previous step, but typically it is done after. Make it something memorable, but not to long.

, Also try making your own tracks to fit your routines, you don't have to use what's already out there! Be imaginative with your routines.

, Practice makes perfect! Make sure each individual rehearses at least every other day and try to organize a crew rehearsal once a week to just have fun but to also create new routines.

, (See tips if out of range or unsuccessful). Or to get started, do some dancing at school or at parties. Make a name for yourself among friends and soon the word will spread.

, Work hard. Have fun. If you aren't having fun, you won't want to work hard and you won't get noticed. Having fun may be the most important element in a dance crew.

Stretch before beginning.,
Enlist a partner that can hold your weight.,
Have your partner grab your upper waist from behind.,
Lift one leg and shift your weight to the other.,
Turn your foot on the ground outward.,
Begin to lift your elevated leg as you lean.,
Bend upwards with your upper body.,
Hold this position as long as possible.,
Work towards tilting on your own.,
As an alternate move, lift your leg as you face your partner.",How to Do a Tilt in Dance1," A tilt is an impressive feat of flexibility. It requires bending your body in a way that most people can't. As with any activity that requires intense bending or flexing, it's important to stretch beforehand to prevent injury. Focus on the types of stretches you would use before doing the splits - namely, hamstring, glute, groin, hip, and lower back stretches.;
, When watching an experienced dancer perform an amazing, acrobatic tilt, it's easy to forget that this move requires lots of practice and preparation. Most dancers won't be able to perform a perfect tilt on their first try - generally, dancers should expect to fail many times before they can pull a perfect tilt on demand. Because of this, if you haven't performed a tilt before, you should minimize the risk of injury from losing balance and falling by getting a partner to help. This partner should be patient, and, more importantly, strong enough to catch you if you fall.

, Your partner should position him or herself behind you and put his or her hands just above your hips. From this position, s/he will be able to support your weight and help you keep balance as you make your tilt.

, In a tilt, the dancer keeps one foot on the ground while raising the other as high as it can go. Keeping one foot squarely planted on the ground, lift your other while bending your knee until your thigh is roughly parallel to the ground. As you do so, make minute adjustments with your core muscles and your foot on the ground to maintain your balance.

, Keeping your other leg elevated, turn the toes of the foot touching the ground about ninety degrees outward - that is, your toes should face away from the center of your body. Turning your foot in this way makes it easier to perform the deep stretch involved in the tilt. Be careful to keep your balance as you perform this adjustment.

, Carefully lift your elevated leg up as you lean your upper body in the opposite direction. Your bent leg should slowly raise and straighten above your hips - it may look like you're performing a very high karate kick. Have your partner support your raised leg with his or her hand on your calf. As you raise your leg, lean your upper body to the side until it is horizontal (or nearly so).


Your partner can help you achieve a more vertical stretch by gently pulling your leg up, but be careful not to stretch your leg beyond its limits.

, As you lift your leg, your upper body should naturally bend toward the raised leg at the waist. As your upper body approaches a horizontal position, this will eventually mean it is bending upwards. Your hips should raise with your leg and push out to the rear.

, Once you can reach this ""final"" position, it's time to work on your ability to hold your tilt on your own. To start, have your partner slowly and gently let go of your thigh while you attempt to hold it in its place. Over time, work to gradually increase the amount of time you can hold your twist until you can maintain your position indefinitely.

, Finally, when you're confident performing the tilt with help from a partner, carefully begin to practice moving into and out of the tilt on your own. Doing so requires great balance and strong stabilizer muscles, so don't be surprised if you're unable to do your tilt the very first time you try. You may need to build significant core strength before you can tilt to your liking. A wall, pole, or even a sturdy piece of furniture can be helpful for supporting your weight as you work on your tilt. These things are somewhat less supportive than a careful partner, giving you an opportunity to gradually strengthen your ability to tilt.

, The ""normal"" tilt described above is similar to performing a side-to-side split, while this move is similar to performing a front-to-back split. Try raising your leg over and around your partner as you face him or her. From this position, you can rest your leg against your partner's shoulder or even use the opportunity to perform a stretch.


Note that this variation requires even-greater flexibility in your hamstrings.

"
"
Focus on hamstring stretches.,
Perform balance exercises.,
Strengthen your core.",How to Do a Tilt in Dance2," As noted above, you'll want to stretch all of the muscles involved in performing the splits before attempting a tilt - glutes, groin, lower back, hips, etc. Most important of all are the hamstrings. The flexibility of these muscles directly dictates how straightly you'll be able to extend your leg and how far you'll be able to stretch it. Luckily, adding any number of a wide variety of hamstring stretches to your fitness routine can help you improve flexibility in your hamstrings.

, When holding a tilt, you're balanced on one leg with the other in the air and your upper body jutting out to the side. This is not an easy position to hold for any length of time without falling over. Doing so requires great balance, especially in the form of strong core and ""stabilizer"" muscles. Try adding balance-strengthening exercises to your fitness routine. These exercises help improve both your natural sense of balance and the stabilizing muscles you use for the tiny posture adjustments that keep you upright while performing a tilt.

, Finally, as in many other dance moves, a strong core is essential for performing tilts. Core muscles are vital for balancing and supporting your weight in awkward dance positions like the tilt. More importantly, a strong core can help prevent strain and injury, especially to the back, which can be debilitating for any type of athlete, dancers not excepted. So, be sure to incorporate plenty of core exercises into your fitness routine - crunches, planks, deadlifts, squats, and lunges, for starters.

;
, That's why it's called the grapevine -- because you'll be ""weaving"" one foot behind the other. You can also put your arms into it, and pump them forward or upward slightly every time you take a step. In the ""Electric Boogie"" video, you can see that the dancers are really pumping their arms, almost as if they were doing the ""Running Man"" with them; it's up to you how much you want to get into it!

, Simply tap the ground with your left foot without putting your weight on the foot. You'll be taking your next step with your left foot, so you should keep the weight on the right foot. You can also clap your hands whenever you tap your feet to add some flair to this dance move.

Congratulations -- you have just completed a grapevine to the right! The grapevine consists of the moves set out in Steps 1-4.
If you want to simplify this dance and aren't ready for the grapevine, instead of weaving one foot behind the other, you can instead simply step the right foot to the right, step your left foot to the right to meet your right foot, tap it, and repeat. So you would do a step-tap, step-tap, instead of the grapevine. If this is what you choose, then you should also do this move on the left side.

, You will now begin mirroring the steps laid out in Steps 1-4 on the left side.

In the original choreography - this is actually a hop - and the turn happens in the air. The brush step was added later.

, This is known as a quarter turn. Turning to the left means that your left shoulder goes back and your right shoulder comes forward. You can kick your right foot up a bit and brush the ground as you transition to the new position; just kick whichever foot is in back to move to the new side, so that it is next to the left foot again. Many will also do a knee lift (with the right knee) and/or clap their hands here.

, Start with the very first step. Note that you -- and hopefully the rest of the group -- will be facing a new direction each time you repeat, continuing to turn 90 degrees after every 18-step cycle. That's the beauty of the line dance -- once you can do it in one direction, all you have to do is to keep turning and repeating it until the music fades.

, A ""grapevine"" is a series of sidesteps in one direction, stepping to the side, then crossing in front or behind with the other foot, then stepping to the side again. A more detailed breakdown is below. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine on the right.

, Many excellent dancers do not make good teachers. Your teacher does not need to be a great dancer, but needs to be knowledgeable enough to be able to instruct people with different body-types, abilities, and learning styles. A teacher with an impressive dance resume may not know how to describe movement for children or beginners.

, See what they have to say about the dance studios. Dancers have usually attended more than one dance studio in their lives, if they've been dancing since they were young, and they will probably have a suggestion. They will know who to avoid, too.

, Do you want to be able to walk there? Is driving for 30 minutes going to be okay? Is there a convenient train or bus?

, Do not be upset if visitors are not allowed, though, as this can disrupt class. Some studios offer 'open classes' designed to give future students a feel for the rigor of the instruction. Be wary of these; they are usually stiff and nerve-wracking and can give students the wrong impression of a studio. You won't really be able to judge whether you like or dislike the studio until your child has taken a few classes with a few different teachers. Teachers should give positive reinforcements to students and be able to point out muscle alignments to improve technique. It is normal for schools to use older students to demonstrate to help train the younger ones.

, Depending on your goals (fun, improvement...) you may not be willing to alter your schedule a lot to include classes. Be sure you explain to the owner of the studio when you could take class, as well as your skill level and the level of intensity you are considering. He or she will probably have a schedule, but the names of the classes can be confusing. Sometimes intermediate classes are classified as advanced, just to separate them from an even more intermediate class. Also, Intensive options are often offered, which can be confusing as well.

, Usually, you can participate in a class without paying if you ask. Don't be put off by the exterior of dance studios. Usually, the outsides are really, really trashy, but often the inside will be brightly painted and welcoming. Even if the inside is trashy, don't assume the instruction will be bad. Some of the best studios invest as much as they can in making an excellent program instead of a pretty waiting area.

, If you want individual attention, don't go to a school with 15-20 dancers. If you don't want a lot of attention, which would actually be bad, go to one with 15+ dancers.

, Do they charge a little extra each month for costumes, or charge separately? Do your research and figure out what would be a reasonable price to pay.

,, Do the teachers use calm voices when teaching, or do you hear yelling? Watch the little ones, do they look like they like being there, this is a good indicator of how happy any age dancer will be there!

Put on your leotard and tights.,
Consider wearing it off your face and shoulders.,
Arrange the hair to sit in the fixed style securely.,
Pack your bag with everything you need.,
Eat a small, healthy light snack before dance class.,
Go to class early.,
Stretch before class.",How to Get Ready for Dance Lessons," Before you go buying all of this elaborate dance gear you might want to check if your dance school has a dress code. If the dress code is a black leotard and pink tights feel free to expand on that. Get a really prettied designed black leotard and match it with seamless or convertible tights. Make sure that you are comfortable and can dance. There are also many types of shoes such as ballet flats, pointe shoes, tap shoes, jazz shoes, foot undies and much more. Make sure to get the correct kind of shoes and check with your dance teacher before you start sewing on ribbons and elastics.


If you have to wear a black leotard and pink tights, get a fancy leotard and some convertible tights. Try using some warm-up gear. Don't worry, you don't have to have a team jacket and all that. Just wearing some casual leggings/trash bag pants and a neutral dance warm-up jacket is fine.;
, Put it in a bun, ponytail, braid, or whatever will get your hair out of your face and so that you don't need to keep fixing it. Most studios prefer if students have their hair in a bun.

, The most important thing is that your hair doesn't fall out. If you are doing turns, leaps and frantic dance steps, you don't want to have to go to the side and redo your hair.


Start by pulling your hair back into a simple ponytail. If you have bangs, secure them back with a headband or with clips.
If you don't have a lot of hair, it might be a good idea to get a bun doughnut or a bun wig.
If you have enough hair wrap your hair in a circular formation and secure with bobby pins. After this wrap, a hair net around the bun and you're good to go.
Start adding colorful flowers, hair bands, and clips.

, Select a dance bag that has ample room, with lots of pockets. Put in all of your different types of dance shoes in the bag with a smaller bag for all of the things that you need for your pointe shoes. Add a water spray bottle, deodorant, hairspray, stretch gear (sweatpants and dance gear), makeup, rubber bands, bobby pins, extra tights and anything extra your teacher might want you to bring.


Try not to wear any makeup to dance class, as it can easily run down due to sweat and it will be messy.

, Eating too much before dance can cause you to feel nauseous or tired., You want to arrive at dance class at least 15 minutes early. This gives you time to stretch, talk to your friends and be ready for class in time.

, This makes sure that you are ready and secures that you won't get hurt. It may be a good idea to even take an extra stretch class. You can also buy things like stretch bands. This makes your ankles stronger and feels like you're pushing against a force.


Try stretching forward on the ground with legs straight in front of you and toes pointed, and then repeat with toes flexed. Stretch in the butterfly, and then open up to a straddle. Lean to the left and then right.
Repeat the straddle stretches. Then, still in a straddle, stretch forward with the feet flexed all the way. Now roll through the middle splits onto your belly and push up, stretching out your back.
Do this with no hands. Then do it with your legs behind you bent. Some people call this a cereal pose. Then roll back through the middle splits and do all of your splits, including the center.

Learn moves and stretches to help you become a contemporary dancer.,
Try to choreograph a dance to a piece of music on your phone or laptop once you've learnt some good moves.,
Look up online classes on YouTube.,
If you want to be serious about dancing, you need to be stretching about three times a day to gain and maintain your flexibility.,

Complete the next stretch.,
If you want your dances to look more impressive, then gymnastics can be incorporated into the choreography.,

Consider joining a school dance group, if you are still in school.,
If you feel you really want to dance, then maybe you need to devote some time to it.",How to Become a Contemporary Dancer Without Lessons," Maybe your bedroom has enough space, maybe you have a big room in your basement or maybe you can practice in your garden, everyone has a different practice place. Don't chose somewhere where other members of your family often are, such as the main family room as your family members may get annoyed if you are always dancing in front of the television.;
, A perfect place for finding instruction is YouTube. Start by watching videos on how to do pirouette turns or any other moves you think look nice. Of course, without proper lessons it will be hard to know whether you are doing the moves correctly but the first thing to do is to master some good turns or tricky positions.

, Practice at home with your dance and you will be learning more and more. Try to create good facial expressions to match the mood of your dance.

, These will often show you the correct foot and arm positions for turns or ballet steps. Be sure to use these tips and perform the correct positions in all of your moves. This will make your dancing more impressive to watch.

, Below are stretches that will help you.

, Slowly stretch down as far as you can go. This stretch should finish with your palms on the ground, head looking back through your legs. Hold it for five seconds, gradually moving up to thirty. Repeat this exercise with your legs together. Instead of palms on the ground your hands should be comfortably resting on your feet.

, It is much like the first two except many people find it harder and you are sat down with your legs straight in front of you. Stretch over and attempt to grab your toes. Once you can do this, see how far past you feet you can go.

, Flexibility is essential to a gymnast, which is why you need to be stretching daily.

, This looks impressive. You simply do a handstand, arch into a bridge and stand up. It is obviously a lot harder than it sounds but it looks impressive if pulled off correctly. Practice with a friend spotting you, doing handstands against your sofa. When you are good, arch you feet until they are on the sofa. Then, kick over until your feet are on the ground. Once mastered, try this without the sofa. The last part of this move is the recovering when you need to stand up which is hard. But try, try to try again and eventually you will succeed! Only do these if you are with someone who can do them and knows what they are doing!

, The splits also make a routine look good, so practice the splits each time you stretch and you will gradually improve. Do not push yourself too far otherwise you could pull or even tear a muscle.

, If you really want to get good at dance try practicing at lunchtimes with a good friend who also wants to dance. Some schools or work placed have dance rooms and most have empty rooms you can use at lunch times. Be sure to ask about them.

, Most schools have free dance groups and joining them will give you extra dance training and also maybe the opportunity to perform at events with the school.

, You could leave that other club that is on the same night as dance, or leave a club you don't particularly like and use the money to pay for your dance lessons instead.

Pick your classes well: Make sure the place you take classes at or the company you are in is a place where you really can be yourself and connect with the teachers and other students.,
Do warm up before start: Before starting on with the dance, it pays off to stretch or warm up as it loosens the stiffness in the body.,
Drink water.,
Time your travel: Get to the studio a few minutes early.,
Concentrate: When class begins, clear your mind of everything, except what you are making your body do.,
Let yourself free: To be creative in your dancing, find your own style.,
Understand the steps: When you are doing a move, think of something else that it reminds you of.,
Maintain your posture: You must hold your chin up, your belly in and a smile on your face as you dance.",How to Be a Creative and Healthy Dancer,";
, Begin preparing an hour or at least 10mins in advance.


Run for 10 minutes, and then stretch your muscles all over your body for 15 minutes. Do yoga stretches and the stretches you do in dance class, switch it up a little.







, Eat a good meal about an hour before class, preferably something healthy. You will feel that pizza in your stomach when you dance.

, See if the room is open for you to go in. If it is practice dance or combinations, you are learning to refresh them in your mind.

, If you do a leap, give it all you got. If you do a tendu, keep your legs tight and your knee turned out. In everything you do, do it to the very very best of your ability.

, If you like ballet, try a little jazz or hip hop, or vice versa. Then, still having form, come up with your own little ways of doing moves. Explore your mind.

, If you were in a theatrical play, think of something you could pretend to be doing while doing that move. For example, when you arabesque, act as if you were young again and leaping into the air to grab lightning bugs. You get the idea... Just be yourself, and let only yourself be expressed when you dance!

, Dance is as much for others as it is for the performer."

Finally, and most importantly, never let go of your dreams.",How to Be a Dancer," It takes a lot of passion and dedication to dance, whether you dance just as a hobby, or if you want to someday be a professional. If you do want to do it for a living, you may have to cut out other sports and after school activities to put in the necessary hours of practice. Remember that dance in itself is a sport and it takes a lot of endurance to dance every day.;
, Whether it be ballet, tap, jazz, swing, lyrical, contemporary, acro, hip hop, break-dance, pointe, modern, or belly dancing - anything you want - just be sure to choose one that suits your style.

, Watch music videos and watch people's moves, buy dancing lessons on a video, read dancing instructions in books and on the internet, watch YouTube tutorials, find a tutor, get tips from friends/professionals, etc. Dancing is hard, but with hard, dedicated work, you will excel in many ways.

, Stand in front of a full-length mirror, turn up the tunes, and move your body! Or you could use a rented out dance studio. Practice different moves on different parts of the body. Be sure that each move transitions nicely into the next. Also make sure you're stretched and do not have cold muscles. Cold muscles can lead to pulling muscles.

, Dance schools can range from a local youth centre to a more intense independent school. If you are planning on dancing throughout high school and college into professional dance you will want to pick a more intense school. Talk to other dancers in your area as well as the teachers of each school to pick the best one for you.

, Remember that it is important to have a base in ballet as well as to branch out into other classes. You do not have to take every class offered, and you can always sign up for more classes. Talk to your dance teacher and ask her to recommend classes and to evaluate your level. The more you practice, the better you will get. If you cannot afford to sign up for lessons, you can always find some nice DVDs at Target or other stores that will teach you good dance technique. However, if you plan to become a professional dancer, it is necessary to take lessons from a reputable school.

, It is very important in the world of dance, the more you stretch, the more you will improve your flexibility. You will stretch every day in class, but you may want to add stretching when you wake up or before you go to sleep to improve flexibility, but make sure you are warm enough so you don't hurt yourself. If you have the space, you may want to put a barre somewhere in your home, preferably in a room with wood floors. Even if you do not have the perfect flooring, you will be able to stretch more if you have one.

, Now that you have your dancing style, lessons, and have chosen the moves that look best on your body, you need to put that knowledge into action! The best way to do this is freestyle dancing in the privacy in your bedroom, and then when you're at an average dancing level, attend school dances to enjoy yourself!

, Dance is a very demanding sport. It is essential to eat a healthy, balanced diet and keep hydrated. If you feel that you are overdoing it, talk to your dance teacher and ask if it is possible to drop a class.

, Now that you have learned and put your new skills in front of your peers, it's time to step it up a notch! Whether you come first or last, you'll always be a winner for putting in the time and effort to accomplish your dreams!

, You can dance for up to four hours a day, but remember to schedule your time. Make sure you are able to do your homework every night. Schedule in friend time for those close to you who do not take dance classes with you. Dance can take over your life, but remember that you need to be a rounded person. If you are not planning to become a professional, and just dance for fun, it is not necessary to put as much time into dance.

, If you don't understand a dance, ask for help, you're not going to learn it by standing in the corner watching! Always talk to your dance teachers if you are having a problem and they will help sorts things out.

, Learn to distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" pain. Dancing isn't an easy thing to do, but it doesn't have to be painful all the time. It's supposed to be fun! If it gets to the point where you're not having fun at all, stop. It's not worth it if you're not enjoying yourself, or if you wish you were pursuing something else.

, Get into the song, and put feeling into it. If it's an upbeat or happy dance, smile, make big, sharp movements, and smile! If it's a sad or emotional dance, make each move slower and use your facial expression to guide your body. That makes every performance a lot better.

, Know that you can do it for sure! Imagine yourself as a brilliant dancer!

, The best dancers in the world are not only great dancers because they are good at dancing. They are so passionate that they decided to work hard, dedicate themselves, and go through much pain so they could be the best dancer they could be. If you know this is what you want to do, put all your heart into it.

, If you have always wanted to dance hip hop, but you're the least cool person you know, go for it. For all you know, it could change your life!

Feel the beat of the music.,
Stand on one leg with your weight slightly forward.,
Bend your raised leg backwards from the knee.,
Kick your leg out in front of you in time with the song.,
Hop onto your kicking leg while bringing your other leg back.,
Swing your arms along with your feet.,
Smooth it out at a show.,
Make the dance your own.",How to Skank," Skanking falls strictly on the beat of the song, so you need to feel the pulse of the music before you begin. Start by tapping your foot along to the song to get the beat down. If you're having trouble keeping up, slow you foot down by tapping half as many beats as before.


Good songs to start with include ""Pressure Drop,"" by Toots & The Maytalls, (slow tempo), by ""Skank by Numbers,"" Mustard Plug (mid-tempo), or ""9mm and a Three Piece Suit,"" by Streetlight Manifesto/Catch-22 (fast tempo).
Even if you aren't perfect, let yourself get into the music. Skanking isn't about perfection!;
, When you are skanking you'll only have one foot on the floor at any given time. Keep your knees slightly bent so that you can move them quickly. Leaning forward may feel weird at first, but it will help you keep your balance as you start moving.

, You want your foot to come back towards your butt, like you are getting ready to kick a soccer ball.

, Each kick will fall on a beat -- every time you would have tapped your foot, you want to be kicking one of your legs.


Start as slowly as you need in order to get in line with the song.
If you still struggle to get the beat right, try kicking in time with the drummer. Listen for one regular drum you can follow and skank to this beat.

, This is probably the hardest part of the dance. Hop on your standing leg while simultaneously bringing your kicking leg to the floor so that they've switched positions. The leg you were just standing on will now be bent back towards your butt.


Stay loose and with your knees slightly bent so that you can hop quickly.
Practice this at a slow tempo to work on transitioning your legs smoothly.

, With your elbow bent and your hands in a fist, throw your opposite arm forward in time with your legs. That means if you are kicking your right leg you will have your left arm forward. Bring your elbow back to your waist and repeat with the opposite arm.


Though this is the traditional way to have your arms, there is no ""right"" way. The only essential part is using the opposite arm as your foot. Toss your whole hand in front of your body, don't bend your elbows, or throw your hands up towards the sky if you'd like.

, Skanking is meant to be group dance-- forming skank lines, skank circles, or taking your dance into a skank pit. The only way to learn is to do it, and to do it with other people.

, When you let yourself go and really feel the music you'll start to make the dance your own and start to really have fun. Try skanking ""double-time"" (twice as many kicks), moving around while you skank, or spinning in place while you dance.


Remember, you can skank to most music that falls on an ""upbeat,"" like reggae. Try skanking to a slower song like ""Easy Skanking,"" by Bob Marley to get a feel for more relaxed skanking.
If you're looking for more good music to skank to, check out Bad Manners, The Specials, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, The (English) Beat, The Toasters, General Public, or any other Two-Tone or 3rd Wave Ska bands.

Practice at home in front of a mirror.,
Move to the beat.,
Incorporate the torso and arms.,
Keep it simple and low-key.,
Observe how other people dance.,
Be ready to adapt to the situation.",How to Be a Better Dancer1," If you’re worried about dancing at a club or during some other social situation, you’re not alone! This is a normal concern, especially if you’ve never danced in public before. The best way to combat your nervousness is to practice at home, preferably in front of a mirror. Wait until you can get some time alone to practice.


When you’re ready, start by putting on a song with a good beat that you can dance to.
No one is watching, so close your eyes and get into the music.;
, The beat is the thump-thump-thump pattern that you hear. Relax and then start to nod your head along with the beat. As you get into the song, start to move your arms very slightly back and forth to the beat. Relax your shoulders and your knees so that they’re loose and easy to move. Gently bounce on your knees to the beat.Give yourself room to find your own style of dancing. As you practice, it will start to develop.

, Your knees are loose. You’re bouncing on them as you nod your head to the beat. Relax your torso and then rotate it slightly, keeping in time with your knee movements. The movement is sort of like when you're skiing. Make sure your arms are relaxed, then start to move them up and down.


Swing your arms so that they move in time with the beat.
Continue to bend your knees and rotate your torso as you incorporate the arm movements.

, As you grow more comfortable, start incorporating additional movements. Loosen and move your shoulders in time with your arm movements. Get your feet moving to the beat – take steps side to side or back and forth. Vary your arm movements a bit. Make sure you continue to nod your head, which will help you stay in sync with the song’s beat.Start out slow and ease your way into it.
It’s always better to make low-key movements rather than spastic ones.

, Watch how people dance in music videos and in movies. Take note of their movements and try them out. Check out the way your friends dance for more ideas. If you’re at a club or party, look for inspiration by watching everyone. You can incorporate your new moves on the spot, or save them for when you’re practicing.

, When you’re dancing, you won’t always have the space you’re used to having during practice. Anticipate different scenarios, such as a crowded dance floor. Practice how you would move in that situation. Consider how you’d move if you had lots of space on a relatively empty dancefloor. Also practice how you’d adapt to dancing face-to-face with another person.


You’ll need to be aware of your knees, so that you can avoid knocking them with your dance partner.
You also won’t have a lot of arm room in front of you. It might feel a little silly, but if you’re having a hard time picturing this, turn to face a wall and dance very close to it.

"
"
Train frequently.,
Assign small tasks or goals for each training session.,
Practice in front of a mirror and video your training sessions.Watching yourself dance is an important training tool.,
Stretch after practice.Flexibility is crucial for a dancer.",How to Be a Better Dancer2," Set a practice schedule for yourself and stick to it. In order to improve, your training sessions should increase in intensity, length and/or frequency over time.The amount of training you choose to do depends on your personal goals and the kind of dance you’re performing. In general, if you’re trying to become a better dancer, a daily practice session is ideal. If you’re a beginner, start with a few training sessions per week and work your way up to daily training.


Set a training plan for yourself that gradually increases in difficulty.
Take practice seriously by removing distractions, like your cell phone and tablet, from the practice room.

, As you’re creating your training plan, try to choose a few things to focus on for each session. For example, you could choose to concentrate on particular movements or portions of a routine in one session. If necessary, set a timer to let you know when you should move on to the next task.To prevent injury, warm up your muscles before practice with some light cardio, like running in place or jumping jacks.
Don’t forget to schedule five to fifteen minute breaks into your sessions., By practicing in front of a mirror, you can immediately correct mistakes and tweak movements in your performance. Taking video of your training sessions is equally important. Spend some time reviewing the video and analyzing yourself afterward.As you review your videos, ask yourself questions like, “What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses? How is my technique?”
Take notes and incorporate what you’ve learned into your next training session. This will result in constant improvement.

, Create a stretching routine and perform it after each practice. Stretch out the muscles that you use the most – the hamstrings, quads, hip flexors, calves, shoulders, forearms and lats. When you’re stretching a muscle, make sure you are in a comfortable position. You should be able to breathe normally and easily. Hold each stretch for 20 to 30 seconds.


Always wait until after you practice to do any serious stretching. Deep stretching can temporarily weaken your muscles, so doing it before practice is counterproductive.
Your post-training flexibility routine should be about 10 minutes long.

"
"
Get consistent feedback.Practicing in front of a mirror and recording training sessions will give you plenty of self-feedback, which is important.,
Find a strong support system.,
Tune out negativity.Constructive criticism from outside sources is crucial for improvement.,
Train seriously.",How to Be a Better Dancer3," However, getting regular feedback from an outside source is also crucial for your improvement. Enlist a dance instructor, advanced dance student or a knowledgeable friend or family member to watch you perform. Go over your performance with them in detail afterward.


Ask them to tell you what you’re doing well along with what needs improvement.
The positive reinforcement provided in the feedback will increase your confidence.

, Have a few key people that you can turn to for advice and motivation, like friends and family members. Consider joining a local dance team for positive reinforcement and interaction. Search out a mentor or instructor to work closely with. These close interactions will provide support and help you build confidence.


A good instructor/mentor will provide advice and motivation without interfering with your natural abilities., Harsh, negative commentary from others is not. Ignore any harmful negativity aimed at you. Try to avoid engaging in negative self-talk and criticism, as well. Replace your negative thought patterns with positive ones.


An example of constructive criticism is, “Your technique gets a little shaky during the middle of the routine. Work on those particular movements before our next session.”
An example of negative commentary to avoid is, “Your technique is weak. Your movements are sloppy and imprecise. You need to do a lot more practicing before you let anyone else see that.”

, Practice breeds confidence. Be sure to put in the necessary amount of training and preparation required for improvement. By consistently putting in serious time and effort, you will become more advanced as a dancer. You will begin to trust in your own skills. As you continue to train and advance, you will become naturally confident about your dancing.

Do aerobic exercise and strength training three times per week.Your dance training shouldn’t be the only exercise you get.,
Rest to prevent overtraining.Muscles repair themselves during periods of rest.,
Take pains and minor injuries seriously.If you’ve injured yourself, don’t dance through the pain.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat a healthy and balanced diet.Dancing is very athletic and requires a lot of energy.",How to Be a Better Dancer4," You also need between 20 and 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three times each week. Aerobic exercise is any kind of continuous movement that keeps your heart rate up, like running, aerobics classes, swimming, cycling, and skipping. Strength training using light weights should be performed three to four times per week.


In general, dancers don’t need to add any bulk, so avoid lifting any heavy weights.
Training with light weights will increase the strength and endurance of your muscles without adding bulk to your body.

, Unrested, a muscle can become strained much more easily. After particularly hard rehearsals, give your muscles a day or so of recovery time. Along with taking days off occasionally, be sure to sleep 7 to 8 hours each night.


Try to keep your sleep habits as consistent as possible.
Fatigue and the likelihood of injury both decrease when you get enough rest.

, Ignoring aches and injuries will only serve to prolong them. It can also result in permanent damage, which will affect your dancing perpetually. Always take time to recover after you’ve hurt yourself.Get advice from your trainer or a doctor about how to address each injury during recovery and follow it.
You risk further injury if you give yourself no recovery time.

, As a dancer, you’ll need to consume more fluids than a less active person to stay healthy. The adequate intake of fluids for men is about 13 cups (3 liters) daily. For women, about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids are needed each day. On a typical training day, you’ll probably need to take in an additional 1.5 to 2.5 cups (400 to 600 milliliters) of water to replace what you lost through sweat.


On days of intense training, you should consume sports drinks containing sodium on top of the additional water.
Drink water and sports drinks during your training, and continue to hydrate well afterward., To perform your best, you need to consume nutrient-rich food. Make sure that your daily diet includes a range of foods from the major food groups – fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean protein including beans and other legumes, nuts and seeds, and other healthy fats."

Bob your head.,
Shift your weight.,
Move your feet.,
Add some hip action.,
Move your arms.,
Style.,
Dab.",How to Dance1," Start by understanding the beat in your head to get how the music is. If it helps, count 1, 2, 3, 4 in your head. Try to pick out the rhythm the band/artist is using for time, it can be a steady beat from the drums, or from the bass.;
, Shift all of your weight to one foot. You can lift the other foot slightly off the ground to make sure all your weight is off of it.


At every other count (preferably 1 to 3) shift your weight completely to the other foot. You can also shift your weight at every single count, but starting out slowly will help you get comfortable before you begin dancing fast.
Keep your legs loose and bend your knees slightly; there should be just a little bit of ""bounce"" to your weight shifts, and a subtle bounce (in place) on the counts when you aren't shifting your weight as well.

, Once you're shifting your weight to the rhythm, begin moving your feet. Right before you shift your weight to a foot, move it slightly, even just an inch or two from where it was before. When you move your foot, keep it fairly close to the ground.


If you're dancing with someone else, be sure to move around in a way that accommodates your partner without stepping on him or her.

, When you put your weight on a foot, move your hips (and your body) slightly in the direction of that foot. If you shift your weight onto your right foot, for example, move your hips to the right. You can twist your body slightly to add a little more movement. For example, when you move to the right, put your right shoulder forward a little and left shoulder back vice versa for when you move to the left.

, If you're uncomfortable, the tendency is to keep your arms close or to let them hang limp. Instead, move your arms around. Keep your hands open or in very loose fists. You can put your arms in the air or at 90 degree angles at your sides (like when you're running)or try one of the arm moves listed below. Whatever you do, don't get stuck on just one move; keep switching it up.


Roll the dice. Make a loose fist and shake your arm and hand as though you are shaking a pair of dice for a roll. After a few shakes, ""roll"" the dice. Don't overuse this move to the point that it becomes comical. (More commonly used by men).
Mow the lawn. Bend forward and with one hand grasp the starter of an imaginary lawn mower. Pull your hand back as though you're pulling on the string to start the mower. Once you get it going, you can take a few steps while you mow the lawn. This move requires a certain amount of confidence to pull off, but it's a lot of fun and can bring a smile or a laugh to those dancing around you. (More commonly used by men).
Swing an air lasso. Grab an imaginary lasso and swing it above your head as though you're about to rope a cow. Shift your weight to the foot opposite your ""lasso hand"" and thrust your hips in that direction. (More commonly used by women).
Pump your fist. Make a fist and then make a pumping motion overhead in a celebratory fashion. (Best used when attending a concert).

, Natural impulses should be followed when dancing freestyle. It's easy to feel like you're only good at one move, but the more you feel the rhythm the more natural the motions will come out. Listening to subtleties in music will also help to train your body to move. Most importantly: be creative! Creating your own dance moves is easy with confidence and an understanding of your body., Move one of your forearms to your forehead and move the other arm to the left."

Combine the steps smoothly to dance the Melbourne Shuffle.",How to Melbourne Shuffle," You should begin with your feet in a “T” shape, or 3rd position in ballet. Put your feet with your heels together and your toes pointed outwards, so that your feet make a “V” shape. Then, slide one foot forward so that the heel is connected to the middle of your back foot. Your feet should now make a “T” shape.


It doesn’t matter which foot is forward.
Your front foot should be pointed out at an angle.;
, Put your weight on the heel of your front foot, and rotate your foot point straight forward. At the same time as you turn your front foot, you pick up your back foot off of the ground. Your front toe should rotate toward your back foot to end up with your foot pointing straight. For example, if your left foot is forward, your foot should rotate towards the right. , Put your weight on the toe of your front foot and rotate your foot back into the starting position by moving your heel. At the same time, place your back foot back down to have the middle of the foot meet the heel of your front foot in the “T” position.


Your feet should end up in the same “T” shape about 6 inches from where you started from.

, Continue to rotate your front foot to the side by first moving the toe and then moving the heel. At the same time lift your back foot and put it back down to meet your front foot.


You should slowly move across the floor to the side when you continue to do this basic move repetitively.

, Practice with one foot forward until you are comfortable completing the dance move across the floor. Then, practice with the opposite foot forward to move the other direction across the floor., Start by doing the T-step across the floor in one direction. Stop when you have enough room to do one more dance step before you want to change directions. To change directions, you’ll need to switch which foot is forward.

, On the last dance step before you want to change directions, put your back foot down in front of your other foot so that you end up in the “T” position with your back foot in front. At the same time as putting your back foot down in front, rotate your other foot into the “T” position by moving the heel to position the foot at the starting angle., Lift your back foot and rotate the new front foot in the new direction you’re traveling. Do the dance steps all the way across the room in this direction, and then change your feet to travel in the opposite direction again.


Practice doing the T-step slowly from side to side to get comfortable with changing directions.

, Start by standing with your legs together, and then pick one leg up so that your foot is off the floor and your thigh is parallel to the ground. It doesn’t matter which leg you start with.

, Hop the leg you’re standing on to slide it back into a small lunge. At the same time, place your other leg back down on the floor with your knee slightly bent. You should end up in a lunge with one leg forward and one back.


Don’t do a big hop. You should only hop high enough to slide your foot back into a lunge position., Gently hop your front foot to slide it a few inches back to end up with your leg centered under your body. At the same time, bring your back leg forward and lift it so that your foot is off the floor and your thigh is parallel to the ground.


This position should be the same as the first position you made, but with the opposite leg raised off the ground.
You should be ready to do the moves again with the opposite leg as the standing leg.

, Repeat steps 2 and 3 continually to dance the running man. You should end up doing two small hops on one foot as you slide it to center and then back into a lunge while you raise the other foot up to do the same thing on that side. Continue doing the dance steps on one side and then the next to dance the Running Man.


The hops are really small. The dance move is actually sliding your foot backwards so make sure you only lift it enough to slide. The dance move should be smooth and not look like you’re jumping.

, Start by dancing the T-step until you are near the middle of the floor. Make sure you only go one direction to get to the center of the floor. It doesn’t matter which direction you travel in, so choose the direction that’s easiest for you to dance the T-step in.

, To make the change from dancing the T-step to dancing the Running Man, you need to start the T-step and end up in a lunge. To start the T-step, lift your back foot while rotating the front foot’s toes to end up with the front foot pointed straight forward. Keep your front foot forward and place your back foot down behind to end up in a lunge position.

, From the lunge position, hop your front foot back to slide it to center while you lift your back leg up. Then, hop your front foot again to slide it back while placing your other foot down to end up in another lunge. Continue doing the Running Man until you’re ready to change back to the T-step again.

, To switch back from the Running Man to the T-step, you need to do half of the Running Man and end up with your feet back in the “T” shape to start the T-step. Hop your front foot to slide it back to center while lifting your back foot up to do the first half of the Running Man. Then, leave your front foot where it is and put your back foot down behind your front foot in the “T” position. You are now ready to start the T-step again.

, Practice transitioning between the two dance steps to be able to smoothly switch from dancing the T-step to dancing the Running Man. When you can easily transition, you can have fun switching back and forth as you dance the Melbourne Shuffle.

Get lined up.,
Position the arms.,
Leave some space.,
Begin moving.",How to Dance2," Rather than lining up directly in front one another, position yourselves so that the center of the woman's chest lines up with the inside of the man's right shoulder.

, The man should place his right hand flat on the small of the woman's back and hold his left hand out to the side at chest level. The woman should place her left hand the man's shoulder, raise her arm to chest level and extend her hand out to the right to hold her partner's hand. Hands should be interlocked like two C's rather than held with fingers intertwined.

, A good guidelines is three to six inches of distance between you to your partner. Be sure your arms are relaxed with a comfortable bend in the elbow and your knees are soft rather than locked.

, The man is meant to lead in a slow dance, so gentlemen should begin by shifting all weight to the right foot. Then every time the music hits the ""one"" of a four-count beat, shift your weight to the other foot. As your weight shifts, pick up the opposite foot and put it down in a slightly different spot so that you don't stay rooted to just one location for the duration of the dance. Move clockwise.

Chicken Dance.,
The Hora.,
Dollar Dance.",How to Dance3," The Chicken Dance is a staple of many wedding receptions. It's easy to do because there are just three basic moves, and you change them in time with the music. This is a very low-pressure dance--no one cares if you mess up. It's called the Chicken Dance after all; don't take it too seriously.


Raise your arms shoulder level and line your thumbs up with your index fingers to create a shape that resembles a chicken's beak. Move your thumbs up and down to simulate a chicken clucking.
Then, ball up your hands and tuck your fists under your arms as though you have wings. Flap your wings up and down in time to the music.
With your wings still in place, continue flapping but now stick out your backside, bend your knees and wiggle your bottom down toward the floor.
Repeat these moves over and over until the song ends.

, The hora is danced at many traditional Jewish wedding receptions to the song ""Hava Nagila."" The hora simply involves dancing in what's known as a ""grapevine"" pattern.


Step the left foot across to the right. Let the right foot follow. Step the left foot in back of the right. Follow again with the right. That's it; that's the grapevine.
This dance is performed in a circle with dancers either holding hands or throwing their arms over one another's shoulders. The tempo of this dance is typically fast; sometimes the music starts slowly, and the band speeds up the tempo as the song goes along.

, Also known as the money dance or the apron dance, wedding guests line up and pay a dollar (or more) to dance with the wedding couple. In some cases, men dance with the bride, and women dance with the groom; other times, both men and women dance with the bride. You can follow the basic slow dance instructions for this dance, but it's really not about the moves; it's about having a few moments with the bride or groom to express your happiness for the couple and compliment the wedding ceremony and reception. Holding on and simply swaying in place is perfectly acceptable if it makes it easier to have a personal conversation.

Take a dance class.,
Join a flash mob.,
Watch dancing on TV.,
Rent a classic dance movie.,
Attend a dance competition.",How to Dance4," There are dance classes for every style of dancing from hip-hop to ballet, break dancing to salsa. Search online for the classes in your area. Whatever style of dance you're interested in, you could probably benefit from a ballroom dancing class as the steps of many other dance styles have their roots in some ballroom basics.


When you are being taught a routine, look at what the teacher is doing. Try to copy it exactly. If it doesn't work, watch the teacher again and look for the little things he or she does that make it easier. Go ahead and and ask your instructor for tips; experienced instructors have worked with hundreds of students and have ideas that can help you overcome whatever it is you're finding to be difficult.
Even a few hours of class time can help you learn the basics and build your confidence.

, A flash mob is a spontaneous public performance--usually a dance--that appears seemingly out of nowhere and then disappears just as quickly. While these dance performances may seem spontaneous, the truth is that they're usually fairly well rehearsed in advance. You can find flash mobs online, join them for a several-week rehearsal period as the group learns a dance and then perform with the mob in public. Flash mobs welcome people of all skill levels; their focus is on having fun and creating a joyful scene, so the more people who participate, the better. You'll also learn some great dance moves and connect with people who also enjoy dancing.

, Dancing is a wildly popular activity, and you can get plenty of exposure to it just by watching TV. Tune into reality television dance-competition shows. Focusing on the steps might be a bit challenging. Instead, pay attention to how loose the dancers are, how much confidence they display and how much fun it looks like they're having on the dance floor.

, There are so many dance movies to choose from; see as many as you can or pick and choose those that speak to your particular interests.


Developing confidence. Check out ""Dirty Dancing"" or ""Shall We Dance"" to watch two dance novices develop confidence and grace and learn to perform with pizzazz.
Finding your inner dance rebel. Watch ""Footloose"" or ""Flashdance"" to see the power of dance as a form of defiance against uptight authority figures and personal circumstances.
Moving with grace--Rent anything starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. They are the embodiment of grace and elegance not to mention great role models for how to move with a partner.
Developing an attitude. Look no further than John Travolta's performance in ""Saturday Night Fever"" for dance floor confidence that wins the girl and the admiration of the crowd. You might want to do a Travolta movie marathon and pick up ""Grease,"" or ""Staying Alive"" .
Coming into your own. When Tom Cruise slides across the floor in an oxford shirt and gym socks in ""Risky Business,"" he kicks off a song-and-dance number that's a carefree celebration of how good it feels to move to the music. Let it inspire you to lose yourself in a great tune and make up some dance moves that just feel good to you.

, Ballroom dancing competition, officially known as DanceSport, are held all over the world. Check online for a competition near you. Check out websites such as the International Grand Ball, United States Dance Championships and the Access Dance Network to name just a few.

Put on your boogie shoes.,
Make sure you can move.,
Be prepared for the heat.",How to Dance5," Choose a shoe with a flexible, thin sole for the dance floor. Stay away from platform shoes; that thick sole and heel make it difficult to feel the floor. Be sure, too, that your feet feel secure in you shoes. Backless sandals are best left at home. Do not wear sneakers or other shoes with rubbery or sticky soles or be prepared to pick up your feet. At best, you'll risk looking a bit herky-jerky in your movements; at worst you may find yourself with a twisted ankle or tweaked-out knee.

, Tight satin might look (and feel) great, but it could inhibit your moves on the dance floor, and one wrong move could leave you with an embarrassing rip. Stay away, too, from tops or shirts that fit low in the armhole; they make it harder to move. Try on your outfit at home to be sure you can dance with ease.

, If you tend to perspire, choose garments made of natural fibers. Tank tops and halter tops can look great, but sweaty or clammy skin could be a turn off if a partner asks you to dance. Drop a pack of moist towelettes and a travel-size powder in your pocket so you can freshen up when needed.

Make sure you are in a party mood.,
Get friends you can go party with.,
Identify the club you want to go to.,
Find out when the club opens and when it closes.,
Pick an outfit that's hip and trendy.,
Take a shower and put on deodorant and a nice fragrance with good staying power, but nothing too overpowering.,
Get dressed, but don't be ultra casual.,
Also if you are a girl, it's a good idea to wear makeup, but don't overdo it.,
Get a good meal before you go out.,
Get your crew together and get to the club.,
Once you are in the club, pick a spot/table, sit and get some drinks.,
Sip your drink, make small talk, and enjoy the music.,
If you are not having a good time, ask yourself why.",How to Go Clubbing," If you aren't, get into one! You may want to play your favorite danceable music at a reasonably high volume.;
, Preferably ones you know well and can rely on. Clubbing is no fun alone.

, Ensure you have transport to and from. If you have a car, make sure it's fueled. If not organize to have a cab pick you up. Pick a designated driver.

, (Small but very important detail.)

, Girls, you want to look sexy but not trashy. Guys, look hip and cool.

, You will be dancing next to many people, so don't let bad body odor scare everyone away!

, It's always fun to dress up fancy, so experiment with your clothes and have fun! If you are a girl, wear shoes that are trendy but not uncomfortable. If you are a guy, avoid sandals. Remember, you'll be on your feet, tearing up that dance floor.

, If you are dancing a lot you may sweat much of it off. Apply a small amount of foundation and concealer if necessary, and put on a light blush and/or highlighter. On your eyes, apply eyeshadow, mascara and eyeliner. A smokey eye is very pretty and brings attention to your eyes, so it would be a good idea to try that out.

, You need to keep the energy level up. Hydrate with water. Fruit juice also works.

, Make sure you have your I.D.

, If you plan to disperse, decide at what time and where you will all regroup.

, Pace yourself and let the ice melt to dilute the alcohol in your drink. You don't want to fall on the dance floor or embarrass yourself from going over your limit. As the night wears on, get up and dance. If you are an awkward dancer, try to move to the rhythm. Don't be too vigorous and always be aware of your surroundings.

, Is it the music? If so, consider going to another club. If it's the company, don't club with them again. If you just don't like the whole atmosphere i.e. the dim lights, the smoke, the alcohol etc, clubbing is not for you, or you could just be in the wrong mood to fully enjoy the experience.

Play the Macarena.,
Start on the third eight count.,
Count with the music.,
Put your right arm straight in front of you with your palm down on 1.,
On 3, flip your right hand over.,
On 5, grab or just touch your left shoulder with your right hand.,
Slide your right hand underneath your left arm and touch the right side of your head on 7.,
Put your right hand on your left hip on 1.,
On 3, place your right hand on the right side of your booty.,
Roll your hips 3 times -- to the right, to the left, and to the right once more on 5, 6, and 7.,
Repeat!,
If you want to really get into it, pulse your shoulders and hips lightly with each beat.",How to Do the Macarena1," Well, you could do it without the actual song, but that'd be weird. So either bust out your Los Del Rio album or get on YouTube or start doing it from memory if you can.;
, There's one beat per count, so the first two eight counts are 16 beats (8 x 2). The first sixteen counts (beats) of the song are subdued -- you just hear a bit of a synthesizer and then BAM! ""Ay!"" happens and you start right after that.









Feel free to do whatever you'd like during these first two eight counts. A lyrical dance? Maybe the Hustle? River  dancing? The more juxtaposition, the better!

, Every beat should be 1 through 8. As soon as you hear the ""Ay!"", know the next beat is one. Every movement corresponds to a specific beat. Always!








, On 2, bring your left arm straight out in front of you, also with your palm down.








, On 4, flip your left hand over. All the way over -- like you're expecting someone to hand you your paycheck.








, Can you guess what's on 6? That's right -- touch your right shoulder with your left hand.








, And on 8? You got it -- touch the left side of your head with your left hand.








, That should be followed by your left hand to your right hip on 2. Can you handle it so far? Are you feeling the urge to feather your bangs?








, On 4, do the same with your left (on your left side).








, Then on 8, jump a quarter-turn to the left and clap your hands. That's it!









Some people don't clap. It's up to you.

, Easy enough, no? Now remember to do it with a smile on your face like you're remembering the glory days of light blue powder eyeshadow and butterfly clips.









As soon as you land, you should be ready to jut out your right hand on 1. Four rotations and you should be exactly where you started.

, The only way you can really pull this off as a dance is if you put your own style into it. So along with the arm movements, feel the music! It's catchy as hell, after all. That Macarena, man. She cray.

Select the right fabrics.,
Try on a mini-skirt or mini-dress.,
Look for a 1970’s style catsuit.,
Wear hot pants.,
Opt for a pair of bell bottoms.,
Choose a shiny, clingy top.,
Pull out the platform shoes.,
Wear your hair straight and long.,
Alternatively, add volume to your hair.,
Use make-up to highlight your eyes.,
Wrap things up with shiny jewelry.",How to Dress Up for a Disco Party1," Disco clothing was made of stretchy, shiny material that readily reflected the bright lights of a disco club. Look for spandex, lycra, velour, and synthetic polyester. Also consider pieces heavily adorned in sparkly sequins or gold lame.;
, Midi-skirts, which came up to the mid-calf, were also popular in the 1970s. Look for a design that flares out slightly starting at the waist. The skirt can have pleats, but does not need them. If you decide to go with a mini-dress, look for one with a halter style top.

, The catsuit was a type of one-piece bodysuit often made of spandex. Typically, the legs were fitted at the thigh and flared out at the knee. The suit could have sleeves that flared out, starting at the elbow, or it could be sleeveless. Many catsuits also featured a halter top or deep v-neck.

, Hot pants in the 1970s were daringly short pants that covered the rear, but barely covered any leg. The pants clung tightly to a woman's legs and did not flare out.

, Not every woman exposed so much of her leg when she went to the disco. Many stuck with bell bottoms. You should still look for bell bottoms made of shiny, clingy material, however. Avoid bell bottom jeans, since these would have been too casual to wear to a disco.

, Popular styles for the disco included halter and bandeau. For a less revealing option that covers your arms, consider a tight, long-sleeve top with sleeves that flare out from the elbow. Look for tops adorned in sequins, metallic leopard print, or other flashy prints.

, Look for a pair with a 1 to 2” sole. Authentically, women could wear platforms up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) high, but these could prove hazardous to individuals unaccustomed to wearing such shoes. Look for bright colors or metallic patterns. Also stick with closed-toe designs, since these were more common to the time period.

, Use a hair straightener to flatten your hair as much as possible, and consider adding temporary extensions if your hair is short.

, While straight hair was slightly more common in the 1970s, large, wavy curls were also in style. Give yourself voluminous ""Farrah Fawcett"" curls if your hair holds a curl well.

,


Use dark eyeliner to trace your lids. Go with a color like black, brown, purple, gray or blue. Stay away from bright colors.
Apply a liquid eyeshadow. Look for a darker color that really makes your eyes stand out.

, Think chunky beaded bracelets and necklaces or medallion pendants. Look for shiny pieces that reflect light well.

Warm up as the music starts.,
Take four steps to the right.,
Take four steps to the left.,
Get your arms moving.,
Stand with your feet together.,
Kick your right foot out.,
Bring your right foot back to center, and tap your left heel out.,
Continue moving your arms to the rhythm, however you feel comfortable.,
Stand with your feet hip width apart and bend your knees.,
Swivel back and forth from right to left, with knees bent.,
As you’re swiveling on bent knees, rotate your whole body a quarter turn.",How to Do the Cupid Shuffle Dance," You’ll know what’s coming, because the song starts by repeating the words, “Cupid Shuffle.” Get to a good spot on the dance floor where you have a little bit of space to showcase your moves. Typically, this dance works best when people are lined up in rows.









Use the musical intro to find your groove. Shake off any self-consciousness you might have and get ready to have some fun.;
, Step your right foot out to the side, and then bring your left foot to meet it. You will be doing this four times total. If the dance floor is pretty crowded, you may only be able to take baby steps. If you have lots of space, feel free to take large steps. By watching the crowd around you and listening to the music, you will easily be able to step in the correct rhythm.







, Like you did on the opposite side, you’ll be bringing your left foot out, planting it, and bringing your right foot to meet it. As long as you are moving to the left, feel free to add a little pep to your step. You can add a little hop, a smooth slide, or maybe sway your hips to the music.







, There isn’t any choreography for your arms, so you can play around with this. Don’t lock your arms to your side, or you’ll look uncomfortable and robotic. Try snapping your fingers, shimmying your shoulders, or placing your hands on your hips. Just do something! This gives you an opportunity to make the dance your own.







, Once you’ve finished stepping to the right and the left, bring your feet back together and stand up straight. For the next move, you will be staying in one place and facing forward. Make sure you have room in front of you to extend your leg.

, Bring it down so that the side of your heel taps the floor in front of you. Your toes will be pointing slightly to the right, never hitting the ground. As your right foot comes out in front of you, your left leg will give a slight bend. 







, Once you get comfortable with this basic step, you can really make it your own. Try giving a little jump as you switch out your feet. Don’t forget to stay bouncy on bent knees, so that you don’t look stiff and uncomfortable throughout the dance. Repeat a kick on each leg, so that you kick to the front a total of four times. 







, As your right leg kicks out, try popping out your left arm, like in a swimming stroke motion. Then alternate, swinging your right arm out as your left leg kicks to the front. You can also try forward punching motions, or rolling your wrists to the music. Again, you really can do anything with your arms as long as you’re doing *something* with them!








, Once you’ve completed all four kicks, get in this stance immediately. Just like the steps and the kicks before this, you will be alternating going from right to left, twice. You won’t need much space for this move. Lift your heels up a bit, so most of your weight is on the balls of your feet.

, You should be turning on the balls of your feet. Picture it as if you were getting into a running stance toward the right, then swiveling to the opposite wall and getting into a runners stance to the left. This is called “walking it out” and you can have fun with this move. 








Keep your arms bent, as they would be if you were actually running.
As you swivel, you can get lower and lower to the floor.

, In other words, you’ll be “walking it out” while slowly turning your whole body to the left. When you restart the dance from the beginning, you will be facing a different wall. You’ll continue to do this dance and doing a quarter turn each time, so eventually you will have made a complete circle.

Put your right arm out in front of you on 1, followed by your left arm out on 3.,
Put your right hand behind your head on 5.,
Put your right hand on your booty on 1.,
Swish your hips right, left, right on 5, 6, and 7.,
Since this goes much slower, get into it!",How to Do the Macarena2," That's right -- the video takes it at half-time. You're skipping half the moves and only moving on the odd counts.








, Your left hand will then go behind your head on 7. You're skipping the part where you flip your palms over. Ain't nobody got time for that!








, Then your left on your booty (the left side, obviously) on 3.








, This is the same as the traditional dance. And then jump a quarter turn to the left and repeat!








, Watch those crazy ladies on the video for inspiration (but don't copy their haircuts). Their hips and shoulders are feeling the beat even when their arms are still. Then you'll be so buena. Your boyfriend Vittorino will never leave town.

Mind your materials.,
Wear an open-necked button-down shirt.,
Find a pair of bell bottoms or flared trousers.,
Throw on an optional suit jacket.,
Don a pair of platform shoes.,
Add volume to your hair.,
Accessorize with a shiny medallion necklace.",How to Dress Up for a Disco Party2," Women weren’t the only ones wearing shiny, clingy fabrics. Men also wore outfits made of spandex, lycra, and synthetic polyester for the purpose of molding their bodies. Satin, sequins, and other reflective materials were especially important for the sake of reflecting light.

, Long sleeves work best. Choose one in a bright color, and look for one made of glossy fabric. Leave the top few buttons undone, exposing your chest. You may even consider popping the collar up, but this is only optional.

, Look for trousers that flare out, starting at the knee. Avoid jeans, and opt for satin or polyester, instead.

, If possible, find a jacket that comes as part of a three-piece suit, complete with pants and a vest. Otherwise, look for a jacket with reflective elements that closely matches the fabric and color of your trousers. The sleeves should be straight and buttoned at the ends.

, Look for a pair with relatively low soles. While 1970s disco fashion permitted men to wear high platforms with 4” soles, most modern day men would be unaccustomed to such height. Stick with lower soles to help prevent any accidents and to keep your feet from getting too sore.

, Use a gel or other hair care product designed to add volume and lift to your hair. Alternatively, you have enough hair and the right hair texture, you could try styling it into an Afro.

, Men did not necessarily wear a ton of jewellery, but they often wore some. Go with a long medallion necklace. Choose one with a shiny pendant that rests within your open shirt, on your bare chest.

You can't be afraid to go crazy, but you also need to focus on your limits and what you can do. Think about if you have these necessary things to create a dancing style that you can call your own.;
, After all, you are going to have to do some pretty goofy stuff before you can perfect your personal dance style and unless you want to be laughed at, solitude is your best option. Although some prefer to have a pet (i.e. dog, cat, even goldfish) with them/watching them for comfort.

, This means really comfortable, like those ratty sweats you'd never wear in public or that boxer shorts/T-shirt combo that your spouse keeps threatening to throw away but never does. Or even your pajamas. Something light and stretchy and easy to move in.

, This is optional, but it may help you become more at ease if you can start singing in that voice of yours that you keep saving for the shower. You don't have to sing while dancing, but it definitive gives you more control.

, You're going to be the star of your own personal show, and you need an audience. What better audience than one which will appreciate you no matter what you do? Fake applause is optional as well.

, Make sure it's something you like and it's got a beat to it.

, Close your eyes and listen to the music. Relax your body, feel the music in your body and start to sway. Open your eyes and...

, Move your feet and tap to the rhythm. The point here is to get comfortable moving your body to music. Use the hairbrush to sing if you want. Don't worry, the only one you'll scare is the cat, and who cares what it thinks? Go crazy!

, Are there any moves you like? Any you would like to toss out the door with yesterday's newspaper? Make a mental note of it. If you're really serious, you may want to break out the video camera.

, Go to a video website and look up dance videos and see a little of how it's supposed to be (good things to search for would be like Ballroom, Samba, Cha-cha, B-boy, Breakdance, Arm wave, Moonwalk, Waltz, Charleston, etc.) just beware of the people that only think they can dance.

, Really like that shoulder roll you do when you've got your groove thing on? Try to do it on purpose. Try to do it at different angles and speeds to discover which one looks best. Once you've got it to where you like it, feel free to bow to the ""audience."" They'll love you for it. Do this for each move you like.

, Just remember to leave the hairbrush at home and wear something besides the ultra-comfy clothes. Don't be afraid to show others your wonderful (or not so) dancing skills.

, By now you have realized that the thing you do with your head where it moves back and forth only emphasizes the electrocuted chicken look. Your ""audience"" may not be complaining, but you sure know about it, and it is not helping out your groove thing one little bit. Don't just toss it out the door; fix it! Do the same thing you did with the things you've liked. Try it slower and faster, change the angle, roll instead of jerking it back and forth. Do this for each move that needs fixing until you're happy with what you see.

, Dancing should be about having fun! If you aren't enjoying yourself, everyone else probably won't either.

, Remember: emphasize the positive, eliminate the negative and blend your all-too-groovy moves until your ""audience"" can't help but cheer at your fantastic self.

To determine the time of a song, listen to the song for a while. As you feel the rhythm, clap your hands every time you hear a major beat in the song lyrics. This will get you your ""top"" number, which is usually always 4 or 8.
For the ""bottom"" number, listen closely to the baseline. Clap your hands every time you hear a major beat in the baseline. The ""bottom"" number is also, almost every time, 4 or 8.
You can find more information about the time of songs here How to Calculate the Time Signature of a Song.;
, This could be your living room, bedroom, or a larger dance studio. Before you begin practicing, clear away any clutter in the room so that you don't trip and fall. It is best to first practice on a carpeted floor, especially if you have a tendency to trip over your feet.








If you are not in a dance studio, try to find a long mirror (usually hang on the back of bedroom/bathroom doors). Seeing yourself dance in front of the mirror will improve your presentation when you go to dance in front of other people. You will be able to see whether you are moving your upper torso enough, how wide your steps are, etc.
If you are dancing on hardwood floors, try and wear tennis shoes, especially for first time dancers. Wearing socks, ballet shoes, or Toms can cause you to slip on waxed hardwood floors.

, The count for the hustle dance is ""1, 2, 3, And. 1, 2, 3, And. Etc."" The ""And"" is the transition between one major part of the dance and the next. Practice stepping to the beat. Turn the music off and just count aloud to yourself.








Step right, left, front and back while staying in rhythm. Maintain the beat in your head and allow your footsteps to follow the beat.
Practice moving your upper torso as well. While your feet are the most crucial part of the dance, your upper body shouldn't be stiff. Your body should move in and out, up and down with the beat as well.

, When you are practicing you will want to wear loose fit clothing. This is because there are arm, leg, and hip movements. You need room to move freely and loose. Sweatpants, and a loose t-shirt are great to practice in.








When you go out to parties and show off your dance routine, you will want to wear something different. Once more, you will want something loose. Don't wear skinny jeans, or tight fitting blouses when dancing the hustle. You will want a shirt with a little extra room, and pants which give an extra inch or two.
You can also wear 1970's style clothes to go with the dance. Bellbottoms, disco shirts, and hippie jackets are all great. Go all out, and really recreate the 70's scene.

, While this isn't an absolute necessity, you will be able to critique one another on how to make each other's dance better. The hustle is traditionally a line dance, meaning that you dance in a line with other people, turning 90 degrees between full dance routines. Having a partner nearby, dancing with you, will get you accustomed to having other people nearby as you dance.The person you choose does not have to be a professional. Having two novices learn the dance at the same time together can greatly improve one another's skills.
Having a partner with you as go out to clubs/parties and dance will also increase your self-esteem as you dance. The goal of any dance is to have fun, so having a partner with whom you have practiced with can increase your motive to go all out.
""Cha-Cha Slide"" is an example of a famous line dance done at parties.

, Begin by standing upright, with your hands to your sides, and your feet closed together. Walk forward in the following pattern: right, left, right. The fourth step is to bring both feet together and tap them. If you are following the correct beat, ""1, 2, 3, And"" is ""right, left, right, tap.""








Each of your steps should be fairly small steps, about 6 inches (15 cm) in front of the other. You do not want your steps to be too long, otherwise you could bump into someone else in front of you.
As you are making the steps, keep your hands to the side, but move them in circular motions. Try to keep your hands moving in the same way your feet are. Every time you move your right foot, move your right hand forward, left foot, left hand, etc. Your hands should move similarly to pedals on a bicycle.

, After you have tapped your feet together, move your feet backwards in small steps. The pattern should go: left, right, left. The fourth step is to tap your feet together. If you are following the correct beat, ""1, 2, 3, And"" is ""left, right, left, tap."" After you get done this sequence of moves, you should be back in the original position you were in at the beginning of Step 1.








Each of these backwards steps should be fairly small, about the same size as the forward steps (6 inches in front of one another). Do not make them too large otherwise you could bump into another dancer behind you.
As you are taking the steps backwards, move your hands backwards as well. Every time you move your left foot backwards a step, move your left hand backwards in a circular motion, right foot, right hand, etc. Your hands should look similar to bicycle pedals moving backwards.

, After you have finished moving forwards and backwards, you are ready to twirl. This move is commonly referred to as a ""step-turn-step-clap."" You first step your right foot slightly to the right, about 6 inches (15 cm). This foot will be your plant foot for the turn. Lift up your left foot, and turn clockwise about 270 degrees. As you are turning, lean your body weight on your right foot.








After you have turned, you will take another step forward with your right foot.
Finish off this sequence by bringing your hands together and clapping them once.
The ""step-turn-step-clap"" should follow the ""1, 2, 3, And,"" beat.
Keep your arms out at 45 degree angles as you are twirling.

, After you have clapped, you can then move on to turning back the other direction. Take an initial step with your left foot, slightly to the left, about 6 inches (15 cm) away. This left foot will be your new plant foot. Lift up your right foot and twist your body counter-clockwise 270 degrees. As you are turning, lean your weight on your left plant foot.








After you have turned, take another step forward with your left foot about 6 inches (15 cm) away.
Finish off this sequence of dance moves by bringing your hands together in front of your chest and clapping once.
Keep your arms out at 45 degree angles as you are turning.
Just like before, this ""step-turn-step-clap"" will follow a ""1, 2, 3, And,"" beat. When you get done this sequence of moves, you should again be right back where you started.

, This move was made famous by John Travolta in the movie ""Saturday Night Fever."" Plant your feet about 6 inches (15 cm) apart from one another. Then make a ""Number 1"" sign with your right hand (right pointer finger sticking out). Take your right arm and place it in the air as high as it will go. Point rightward toward the ceiling. Then immediately take your right arm and place it down as far as it will go. Point leftward toward the ground.








You will do four sets of these. This means that you will go, with your right arm, ""up-down-up-down-up-down-up-down."" The sequence follows the basic beat you have been using all along: ""1, 2, 3, And. 1, 2, 3, And.""
As you are moving your right arm upwards, and towards the right, do the same with your head/eyes. Simply follow your right hand with your eyes. When your hand goes down, and to the left, follow again with your head/eyes.
This is a great time to bring in some hip movement. When your hand is pointing upwards, and towards the right, twist your hips slightly to the right. When your hand goes to the left, and down, turn your hips to the left.

, After you are done pointing, move directly into the chicken style dance. First, you will make fists with both hands. Then roll them over one another directly in front of your chest. You will do this for the first two beats of the ""1, 2, 3, And"" rhythm. Count ""1, 2"" in your head before you move onto the next part of the routine. Next, place your hands on your hips and bend your elbows outwards at 90 degree angles.








For the third beat of the rhythm, turn your upper body towards the right, and move your ""wings"" (elbows) once. Then, for the fourth beat, move your upper body to the left, and move your ""wings"" once again.
Each time you move your ""wings,"" lift your feet up so that you are on your toes. Click your heels together. You will do this for both beat 3 and 4.
The basic beat ""1, 2, 3, And"" should be ""roll hands, roll hands, wings right, wings left.""

, Because the hustle is a line dance, you will need to turn your body 90 degrees before you begin all of the steps all over again. Move your right foot backwards about a foot. Then move your left foot backwards a foot as well. After you get this second step backwards complete, place your entire weight o your left foot.








Lift your right foot an inch off the ground. Turn your body 90 degrees clockwise (or counter-clockwise, depending on the movement of a particular dance group) while leaning your weight on your left foot.
Finally, reposition your feet, and close them together. You can even click your feet together to perform a more accentuated move.
The basic beat ""1, 2, 3, And"" will be ""right, left, turn, close.""

, Try practicing the basic steps first without music. This will give you a chance to take the different steps in sections. You also won't have to worry so much about having to constantly stop and restart the music. Once you have the moves committed to memory, turn on the music and perform the steps with the beat.








Do this for at least two songs. Remember each disco song is slightly different. If you get so used to dancing to one song, you won't be able to apply the moves to others.
After you have practiced for a while. Wait about an hour before you begin to dance again. See if you can get up, and do all of the moves without being prompted by the beat of music. If you can do the steps right then and there, you should have them successfully committed to memory.

, If there isn't a line at your party, you can still do the hustle by yourself, and even with a friend. Take your partner's hands in the first two steps as you are moving forwards and backwards. Note: your partner will start the hustle by moving backwards, while you are moving forwards, and vice versa.


When you are turning in the next few steps, release your hands and turn at the same time. When you are both finished a turn, you will both clap in front of one another. You can also take turns twirling, watching the other partner do one twirl, and then you do the next twirl.
When you do the John Travolta ""point"" you should do it facing one another. You can point in the same directions, or alternate for a neat effect. For example, when you point right and upwards, your partner will point left and downwards.
Perform the chicken move in front of one another. Vacate the step where you turn 90 degrees clockwise. Move your right foot back, then your left. Move your right foot forward, then your right. Then begin the steps all over again.

, The hustle is a very forgiving beat, and as long as you keep the basic rhythm as outlined above, you can throw in moves from swing, salsa, merengue, west-coast swing, and cha-cha with relative ease. You can toss in different moves between major steps in the hustle, or after you have completed all of the major steps one time through.








Some examples: hips thrusting forwards as you keep your hands in the air; side slides to the left and right; and/or lifting your right leg up with your right arm, lifting it four times.
Whatever moves you choose, make sure that you are still following the basic beat of ""1, 2, 3, And.""
If you are doing the hustle with a friend, stand and clap as you watch them do some extra moves. They can do the same as they watch you bust some new moves. Then join back together and go back into the routine hustle steps.

So first things first, any girl can dance this, and it is really easy to learn.,
First, practice moving your hips, clockwise, forward/backward.,
When dancing with a guy, it may be sort of awkward of first since you don't know how to start, so it's a good idea facing each other and moving your hips, and taking small steps (but don't overdo it, your not dancing hip-hop).,
Make eye contact and smile, sometimes the guys are kind of nervous and this helps them feel confident and comfortable.

,
Then slowly, or on beat depending; turn around, where he will now be holding on to your hips, where he will be following your lead.,
Remember to move your hips on beat!

,
It may get boring for your partner if you just stay there moving your hips in the same position, so get lower, move your arms turn around.,
When grinding its good to grind deeply, you'll seem more of a professional reggaeton dancer.

,
If you know how to belly dance, then maybe add a little of that.,
You can try to start using your bum as a main thing in this dance.,
When finish smile, or say thanks.

",How to Dance Reggaeton (for Girls)," However there are things you could do to dance better, and make all guys want to dance with you.;
, One of the major problems that makes a girl seem like a bad reggae ton dancer, is not having rhythm, so listen to reggae ton music, so you can get use to the beats (the rhythm used in Reggaeton-songs is called ""dembow"" and features a long boo moving your hips in many different directions.

, You could also take this opportunity to add your own style to it, like some salsa steps.

,, Now here it helps if you just get in your own zone, imagine you in your room facing a mirror. It is also really intimate when you raise you arms and hold hands with your partner, or put your arms around your partner's neck.

,, Or if you know ballet, add a little heel.

, Shake it, but slowly. Do anything you want, but take care of leaving the boy in an awkward position...

Strike up a conversation with a woman at the bar or edge of the dance floor.,
Head down to the dance floor to see if anyone wants a partner.,
Make eye contact and smile to see if she wants to dance.,
Don't spend your whole night searching for women.,
Keep your movements simple and low-key.,
Learn the two-step to get through any song at any club.,
Bump and grind if a woman moves in closely, so that your hips are touching or close by.,
Bounce to the beat if you're lost or unsure what to do.,
Mix and match simple movements together to appear like an amazing dancer.,
Pay attention to the drum beat to dance with rhythm.,
Let the ""leader"" of the dance come out organically.,
Let her initiate any increase in touching.,
Focus your attention on her, not other women.,
Mix up your moves as you get more comfortable.,
Don't look at dancing as a competition or ""test"" you need to win.",How to Dance With a Girl in a Club," The secret to finding a dance partner isn't a secret at all -- it's simply conversation. Look her in the eye, say hello, and introduce yourself. That may seem terrifying, but it is far easier, and more effective, then trying bad pick-up lines or hoping she comes up to you. If she smiles back or seems interested in talking, get to know her a bit and invite her onto the dance floor.While it seems cliche, confidence really is the best way to meet women. Simply put yourself next to her and start talking -- you're already ahead of 90% of the other men.
If you're having trouble making conversation, just go out onto the dance floor and start dancing, usually with friends. Again, this just shows the kind of confidence that will make it easier to find women.
You will get rejected sometimes -- but it is not personal. A girl may have a boyfriend, want to be with her friends, or just not feel great. Rejection is inevitable, so move on and find someone else.;
, If you're worried about striking up a conversation or it's too loud to talk, just go to the dance floor and start enjoying yourself. As you dance, look around for women who are dancing by themselves or in a small group. You don't want to rush at them, but any women looking for a partner will likely have her eyes up as well.


If you're uncomfortable dancing, just sway back and forth with the rhythm of the drums. Lift each arm individually with the beat and keep your joints loose and relaxed. You'll blend right in.
If a woman is with a group of friends, dodges eye contact, or seems busy with another man, just move on. Plenty of people go to clubs to find someone to dance with, so don't waste everyone's time chasing a girl who doesn't want the attention.

, The near-universal sign of attraction is eye-contact and a smile.Whether you meet on the dance floor or at the bar, good eye contact and a natural smile is the key to sparking a connection. In fact, smiling is proven to be the most effective form of flirting, so look happy.If she reciprocates, you can:


Nod your head towards the dance floor.
Ask ""care for a dance?""
Offer her your hand to her and playfully pull her towards the floor.
Move in closer while you dance., This isn't just a bad way to spend an evening, it's not going to work. If you seem like you're hunting for a woman to dance with, trying everything to get one to like you, you're going to come off as desperate. Again, though it seems easier said than done, be confident, cool, and collected. You are there to have a good time, but you should remember that you don't need a woman to enjoy yourself. Talk to your friends, start a conversation at the bar, and go dance when you want to dance. You'll be surprised how attractive this personal confidence can be.


Never try and juggle multiple ""options"" throughout the night. Chances are good it will backfire, and you'll justifiably look like a jerk., Don't try to impress anyone with spastic, difficult moves you can't pull off. Simply feel the groove and get moving. Above all, try to do all the following moves fluidly, not as fast as you can or with large, expressive accents. If you want to practice, make sure that you have some music on. A mirror can help too, helping you see exactly what you look like to try and improve.


Dancing is all about feel, not showing off. As long as you stay on the beat (follow the drums if you get lost) you'll be fine.
Repetition while dancing is fine! Don't feel like you need to change things up every 30 seconds., This simple dance staple can be used for at any song, anywhere. To do it, start with both feet roughly shoulder-width apart. Count out the beats on the drum: 1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4, - etc. Step your right foot out to the right on the first beat. Then follow with your left foot, tapping your left toe down by the right foot on the second beat. One the third beat, step your left foot to the left. Then follow with your right foot, tapping the toe down on the last beat. You'll be right back where you started, so keep repeating it. Variations include:


Keep your arms up, snapping, clapping, or pumping them to the beat as well. Just don't leave them glued to your side.
Rotate and swing your shoulders with the beat to get your upper body involved.
On the second and fourth step, try landing with your heel out in front of you instead of your toe, or placing your tow behind your planted foot.
As you get better, trying moving forward, backward, or around as you do the two-step., Grinding is perhaps the most common and intimate partner dance that happens in the clubs. Luckily, it is also incredibly easy to do. Place your hands on her hip, and stagger your feet with hers so that you're not constantly bumping knees. From there, simply swing your hips back and forth together on the beat. She will likely take charge, so just lock into her rhythm and move with her, keeping your hips swinging from side to side. You can add some simple variations by:


Removing one hand and raising it in the air, or clasping on of her hands.
Bending your knees together and going down low, especially if the song is calming down before a drop.
Spinning her around and trying face to face, especially if there is good chemistry between you both.

, It is the easiest dance move possible, but also perfectly acceptable in the club. Just bend your knees slightly to the beat, rocking your shoulders back and forth as you do. Keep your hands up, snapping or clapping as you do, so that your whole body appears loose and relaxed. If you've got nothing else, this will always keep you moving.


Remember to move to the drum beat. Rhythm is easy, just follow the ""boom-clap, boom-clap"" found in the drum section of 99% of club songs., Dancing well is not as complicated as it looks. Of course, complex moves take years of training to get right, but in the club all you need are two or three staples that you can string together. Once you can do the two-step and bounce confidently to the beat, try adding the following slight movements together, doing them for 4-8 beats and then switching it up.Bob or turn your head to the beat.
Rotate one of your knees back and forth.
Turn and twist your shoulders back and forth, bending down with the beat.
Pivot or twist on one toe.
Extend your arms out in front of you, crossing and uncrossing them.

, It doesn't matter how good or bad you are-- if you stay in time, you'll be fine. Luckily, club music is easy to dance to, since the drums will count out your steps for you. Move your feet, shoulders and arms in time with the ""boom - chick'"" of the drum beat. Every time you hear the ""snap"" of a snare drum, touch a foot down. This should be all the rhythm you need.


Step one foot to the side, then bring your other foot to meet it. Then move back to the other side. This quick ""two-step"" looks natural no matter what is playing.
Do not try and change or adapt your tempo to fit her if you feel off; this just makes it harder for both of you to find time together. Just listen to the music and sync your body up with that -- she will do the same without your help., In older forms of dance, a male typically led the female across the floor in complex patterns. Club dancing requires no such bravado, especially if you're not a natural dancer. So, instead of trying to be something you're not, just let go and enjoy yourself. Follow her led for a bit. Take her hand and spin her. Bend your knees and go down low together when the beat slows down. Move slightly away and bust a move, even if it's corny. Instead of trying to come up with the perfect dance ""plan,"" just have fun -- chances are it will rub off on her.If you are a good dancer, and you feel confident, go ahead and take the lead.
Don't pinch or otherwise make childish grabs at her. You'll destroy whatever chemistry there was between the two of you. Play it safe and follow her lead until you're perfectly clear on what she wants., Some ladies will want to increase the intensity while others want to take it slow. Don't rush into it, and definitely do not start grabbing or holding onto her. Depending on the situation, there are comfortable, non-confrontational places to put your hands, and let her dictate what she wants from there. Realize, however, that these are just suggestions -- the two of you should feel comfortable setting and respecting boundaries together. If she likes something, it's fine -- if she rejects it, you need to stop.


If you're grinding, dancing back-to-front and up close, you can start with one hand high on her waist, at about the top of her hipbone.
If you're leading her to the dance floor, you can hold her hand or lightly place yours on in the middle of her back.
If you're dancing face to face, you likely won't start with a lot of physical contact. But grabbing her hand and taking her for a quick, playful spin is a great way to bridge the gap.

, Once you're dancing with a woman you should be having fun with her, not off looking for another conquest. The reasons are numerous, but the most important one is that it is rude. If you're not enjoying the woman you're dancing with then stop dancing with her and actually find someone else -- otherwise you should be in the moment with her., As the songs change, do the same thing with your moves. Get down low. Put your arms around different parts of her body (within reason, unless she suggests otherwise). Incorporate hand gestures on occasion. Above all -- do it with a smile on your face. You don't need to make a fool of yourself, you just need to have fun. So open up a little bit, make her laugh, and keep dancing. If you're looking to broaden your dancing move set, check out:

Dance Some Basic Moves
Dance at the Club.

, Most women do not go to the club to find the single best dancer there and take them home, even though most men seem to think they have to be the greatest moon walker since Michael Jackson. In reality, the best partners are fun, confident, and able to stay on a beat. The lights are low, drinks have been poured, and the music is bumping. So stop worrying about getting everything perfect and have a good time -- you'll get a lot more dances as a result."

Whether you're between moves or completely freestyle, disco is a fast-paced dance with a lot of movement.While getting into the groove or planning more complicated steps, do some cycles of the following components simultaneously:


Take a few steps to your right, left, back, and forward to the beat. In general, three steps work best with freestyle solo disco.
Keep your posture upright and confident. Try to picture yourself ""strutting"" to the beat with your steps.
Wiggle your hips from side to side, also to the beat.
Get your shoulders into it. You can shimmy, where you shake your shoulders, alternating each forward and back.Alternating left and right shoulder rolls also works well with disco. Whatever you do, just keep it consistent for a few cycles.
Your hands should be kept at about shoulder height and incorporated into your dance. You can choose to move them from side opposite to your shoulders. If you're shimmying, keep them relatively still with your elbows pointed down. The exact movements aren't important as long as they're timed properly and repeat.
Make sure your whole body is moving. If you dance with just your legs or just your upper body, your dance won't fit the high energy required for disco.;
, The majority of choreographed disco dances work with 3-step and 4-step cycles that go along with the beat.The ""beat"" is a measure of time intervals of music. Try tapping your toes or clapping your hands to the music. Each tap or clap is one beat.Keep your steps in time with the beat.

, The Bump is probably the easiest disco ""move"" you can do and is best done with a partner. Simply sway from side to side with the beat.


Move your hips from left to right, switching positions with each beat. Time your movements with your partner so that the two of you gently ""bump"" your hips every other beat.
Keep your hands in the air and move them in the opposite direction of your hips.
Unlike other disco moves, it's best to keep your feet grounded. , While early disco relied on choreographed dances plucked from earlier styles, popular mainstream disco became much more freeform.Choose your own twists, turns, dips, and tricks to personalize your dance. Just be sure to create a consistent step pattern for each dance and keep in time with the music.


Modern freestyle disco dancing can incorporate flips and other acrobatic tricks, especially in professional competitions.If you have the skills to pull these off safely, try punctuating every few step cycles with a trick.

, As a line dance, the Bus Stop is best done with a group of people organized together into rows and columns. Time your steps so that the entire group does the dance simultaneously. Start with everyone facing the same direction.


If you're dancing by yourself, it's perfectly fine to do the Bus Stop solo. Partners are not needed for the dance itself.The Bus Stop is sometimes called the Hustle. Keep in mind that there are many very different types of disco dances referred to as the Hustle. While the first disco dances with the name were partnered, versions for single dancers dominated later on. Some Hustles, like the Bus Stop are line dances meant to be done by big groups of solo dancers. Each of these three main groups has several regional and cultural variants. There is no definitive version that can be called the Hustle.The Bus Stop or Hustle described here is a 3-step line dance popularized by a dance featured in the movie Saturday Night Fever., Perform these two motions at once.This is the first ""step"" to time with the beat. The initial clap will help the group to synchronize, providing a starting beat to work with. If you find yourself getting out of step, syncing up with a clap will help you get back on track.

, Walk backwards three steps starting with your right foot. On what would be the fourth step back, simply tap your left foot back instead of putting your full weight on it (also called a ""touch""). Then, take three steps forward beginning with your left foot., Start again with the kick and clap. Take another three steps back. Touch again with your left foot before taking three steps forward to return to your starting position., Take a sliding side step to the right and slightly back with your right foot. Bring your left foot in front across your right foot with your left heel passing over your right toes for a step. Take another step to the right with your right foot. Next, bring your left foot next to your right for a touch.After the touch, reverse your moves starting with a slightly back left side step with your left foot., Take a step to the right with your right foot, then bring your left foot in and touch next to it. Step to the left with your left foot and bring your right in for a touch together. Follow up with two heel clicks. Finish this section by first touching your right foot forward, then swinging it back to touch backward., Swing your right foot forward and tap it twice. Bring it back and tap another two times. Touch forward again once and back again once. Finish up with a touch together., Run through the entire dance again in a new direction. Start with the kick and clap and end with another turn to the left. Repeat this process until you've either done the dance in all four directionsor the song ends.

, Before its explosion in popularity in the late 70s, most disco dancing was partnered.If you don't have a partner or would just like to practice solo, simply do the steps of your preferred part. You can also do a set of each to know the dance inside and out.

, Stand relatively close together so that each of you is able to take at least one step back with your hands still connected. Two major ways of connecting are:


The traditional closed position used in many styles of dance. The lead and the follow hold hands on one side, usually the follow's right and the lead's left. The lead holds the follow by placing his or her right hand on the follow's back. The follow's left arm is draped over the lead's right shoulder or upper arm.Simply hold hands on both sides with your elbows bent.

, If you are leading, tap your left foot to your left side without putting your weight on it. If you are following, mirror your partner's foot with your right.


You may choose to tap your foot in place or behind you instead., If you are leading, bring your left foot back next to your right with your weight on it. If you are following, match your right foot to your partner's left. Remember to keep in sync with your partner at all times., If you are leading, step back with your right foot then bring your left to meet it. If you are following, mirror your partner's feet by stepping back with your left and meeting it with your right. Do both halves of this step very quickly within the same beat., The next three steps can vary depending on how the lead wants to go.


If you are leading, take a step with your right foot. In general, this step is done forwards to return close to your partner. However, you can choose to step in place or further backward. Then take a step with your left foot and then a step with your right foot. These steps can also be done in place, backwards, or forwards.
If you are following, take the same three steps as your partner but with opposite feet., Go back to the closed position and run through these steps again. The lead may choose to guide the dance in a certain direction around the dance floor. Continue the step cycle for the duration of the song.

, You can choose from hundreds of established figures or create your own. A few consecutive single figures can be chained together. Some well-known figures include:


Dishrag: Starting from two hand holds or with crossed hands, the lead lifts up his or her hands and turns the follow underneath.
Inside Spin: The lead lifts up one arm and stays in place while the follow does a counterclockwise turn.
Butterfly: From an open two-hand hold, the dancers walk around each other, turning clockwise or counterclockwise."

Smile.",How to Dance at a Nightclub," The better you feel about yourself, the more fun you will have on the dance floor. Put on your favorite outfit, and be sure to wear something that you can actually move in. Stay away from clothes that are too tight or short, and wear comfortable shoes.


You should also take into account the dress code at the nightclub; some clubs are more strict than others.;
, The more people you are with, the less self-conscious you will feel on the dance floor. In addition, having friends around to talk to will serve as a distraction so that you are not constantly focusing on being watched by strangers. Hit the club with an upbeat group of friends who you enjoy having fun with.

, Before heading to the dance floor, do a lap around the club to check out what's going on. Take in your surroundings, watch other people dancing, and get a feel for the kind of music that is playing. Getting comfortable with your surroundings will cut some of the nervousness you may feel upon entering the club.


If you need to head to the bathroom to touch up your makeup or check your hair, do it before hitting the dance floor so that you're not distracted while dancing.

, You don't have to get drunk to have fun at a club, but consider heading to the bar and sipping on a drink while chatting with your friends. This will help you loosen up, give you time to adjust to the club setting, and maybe even meet new people!


Always drink responsibly. While alcohol may loosen you up, getting too drunk will only cause you to get into trouble and embarrass yourself.

, If you are feeling nervous about dancing, you might be tightening up your neck and shoulder muscles or locking up your knees, making dancing feel and look very awkward. Allow these muscles to loosen up. If it helps, head to the bathroom, take a few deep breaths, and shake your entire body to release some tension.

, Rather than focusing on what moves you should bust out, take a moment to listen to the song that's playing and notice the beat. Once you have found the beat, start bobbing your head to the music. This will help you find your rhythm when dancing.


You will have the most fun dancing to songs that you know or that you like. If you are having trouble finding the beat of unfamiliar music, or if you don't like the music that's playing, you might want to sit a few dances out until a song you like comes on.

, If you are with a group of friends, then let them encircle you so that you don't feel self-conscious about being watched by strangers. Allow your body to move naturally to the music. Pay attention to the rhythm of the song that's playing, and don't try to dance faster than the beat of the song itself.


Start by bobbing your head to the beat and moving from side to side.
Sway your hips back and forth.
Take small steps from side to side while dancing.

, If you continue to feel uncomfortable or stuck, then look around the dance floor and find some good dancers who really seem to be in their element. Pay attention to their style their rhythm, and imitate some of their moves. Be sure not to be too obvious by constantly staring at one person.

, Look like you're having fun! Smiling and laughing with your friends will release endorphins in your body, making dancing feel more natural and fun. Plus, you will look silly dancing with a frown or scowl on your face.


Sing along with your favorite songs to help get you riled up.

Relax.",How to Do Some Basic Club Dance Moves," If you're not sure what to do on the dance floor, just bounce to the beat. You do this by bending your knees slightly and then standing back up to the beat. This can be a very small, fast move that makes you look like you're just bobbing along to the music, or a much larger, pronounced motion where you're exaggerating the bends and the pauses.Try shifting your body from side to side so you don't look like a buoy in the water.









A variation is to sway back and forth to the music. Make sure your legs are shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Instead of bouncing, just sway back and forth. Try pausing for a beat when you get to the side.Keep your shoulders relaxed. Being too stiff will interfere with the movements; you want to be smooth as you groove. Let your arms sway as you bounce.
Just find the tempo of the music and start moving to it. If you're unsure how to find the tempo, listen for the drums and the bass line. Listen for the thump-thump-thump pattern in the undertone of the song.;
, If you're just bouncing along to the music, try bending your arms at about 45 degree angles. Keeping them at about chest height, move them up and down to the beat of the music. Don't worry about being rigid - let your arms flow as they move. Point your fist towards your shoulder or hip, have one arm up high while the other is low. Vary where you place your arms as you dance; don't keep them in one position. Move with what feels right for the music.







, As you are bouncing and moving your arms around, don't keep your head there, stiff and unmoving. Nod your head to the music.Turn your head from side to side as you look around the room. Look down at the ground, and then glance up to the ceiling. Do a combination of all these head moves to keep it fluid as you change it up.








, Another dance move is to roll your shoulders to the beat. Hang your arms down by your side, and starting with the right shoulder, roll it backwards. Then, roll the left shoulder backwards. Alternate as you bounce and sway to the music.









You can also add your arms by lifting one arm as you roll that shoulder, then lifting the other arm while lowering the one you just lifted. Keep it a fluid motion as you dance., Another common basic club dance move is rolling your hips around. As you bounce or move your body to the beat, add some hip action. Move your hips from side to side as you bounce or roll them in circles.









One way to get some hip movements is to write the letters of your name with your hips. Move your hips as if you are making the outline of the letters. Just remember to keep it in time with the music.

, The simplest club dance move you can do is the two-step. To dance the two-step, just step your right leg to the side, then move your left leg to meet it. Then do the same thing on the other side. Find the beat of the music and step to the side.









To make this move less rigid, move your body in an up and down bouncing motion. This gives you a bit more movement as you step from side to side.Engage your upper body by moving your torso off-center, so you're leaning in one direction or the other. You can also lean forwards and backwards, changing up the position of your upper body every time you step to the side., A variation of the two-step is the step behind. Start by stepping your right leg to the side. Instead of stepping the left foot to meet your right one, pull it behind you and tap the toe of your second foot behind your heel. Then step out with the left foot and bring your right leg behind it to tap.









To mix it up, push the second foot in front of you, tapping in front of the toe with your opposite heel as you lean back., The step clap is similar to the two-step, but adds in the arms. Step from side to side, clapping your hands when you get to the side. Try to clap your hands along to the rhythm of the music.









After you get the hang of the step clap, you can make it wider by stepping out in a larger range of motion. Try bending your knees lower or swaying your upper body along with the movement., Start with your legs shoulder-width apart. Pivot on your feet, turning your body slightly towards one side. When your body gets to the side, pause and hold. While you are paused, drop your back shoulder slightly, which makes you lean away slightly. As you drop and lean, snap the fingers on the hand on that side. Move back to center, then pivot in the other direction and perform the same steps with the other arm.







, Hold your hands above your head. Move your arms in a large circular motion through the air. To add the legs, make a 90 degree turn with each circle of your arms. Lead with the outside foot, so that the inside foot stays mostly still, like you are pivoting around that leg.








Each turn should follow a 2-step rhythm. On one, you step with the outer foot; on two, you rotate your inner foot. The arms follow a similar tempo. With each beat, your arms should complete half a circle. On one, your arms are to one side; on two, your arms circle back to start.

, Before you head out, search for videos of club dance moves. Some of these videos just feature people dancing to club music, others take you through tutorials of how to master the moves. Watching these videos can help give you a mental picture of the moves that you can imitate.

, If you're extremely worried about what you look like, tape yourself dancing to club music to make sure your moves look okay. Fix anything you find strange about your movements. Compare it to videos you see online.


Look for things like not enough movement, being too stiff, arms being too rigid, and awkward head movements.

, Get dressed up and go to the club with a group of friends. This can help you feel relaxed and less self-conscious, which will help you perform the dance moves much more confidently.


One of the worst things you can do at a club is overthink your moves. Overthinking makes you rigid and awkward. Be careful not to do spastic moves where you are flailing all over the dance floor either.

, When you first get to the club, scope out the other people on the dance floor. See how they are dancing, what they look like, what kind of moves they are doing. More than likely, they will be doing some of the same basic dance moves you will be. Don't stress and have fun.


Relaxing also helps you stay loose. If you're feeling tense, just start moving around to warm up and loosen your muscles. Roll your shoulders, stretch your neck from side to side, sway as you bounce a bit. This helps you get the key body parts moving so you can dance more fluidly.

Be silly.No matter what, dancing is about having fun.",How to Dance With Confidence," Use a simple two-step to find the beats in your favorite songs. Then you can be more confident finding the beat in the dance floor.Start with your feet together. Step your right foot to the side, then bring it back to center. Then do the same on the left with your left foot. Repeat until you feel that you can do it with confidence.
If your steps are not lining up with louder drumbeats, it is likely that you are off the beat. Listen to the music for a moment, then start again, stepping on the louder parts of the beat.;
, This requires less movement than the two-step, but a little bit more style. Start with your feet apart. Stomp your right foot. Then bring your shoulders to the right and spin your left foot on its toe so that your heel hits the floor to the right of it. As you hit your left heel on the floor, snap your fingers. Then repeat on the left side.

, Flip or comb through your hair. Then shake your shoulders. Move your hips and then end with a step.


A lot of dance music is written in four, meaning that you count up to four or eight, and then change tactics. You can spend one beat on each move, but spending two beats is easier. This means that you hair comb for two beats, shake your shoulders for two beats, move your hips for two beats, and then two step for the last two.

, In general, you can get away with a two-step on any dance floor. However, you may not know what to do with your arms. It is essential that you check the crowd around you to get the general feeling, however there are a few general rules you can follow.


Techno and EDM music is accompanied by fist pumping, or arm-pumping. Do whatever feels good with your hand, but pump your shoulder and elbow on each beat. Pop music is accompanied by arms in the air, often around the hair, or waving. Occasionally they move down the body. Hip hop music usually involves quick movements of the arms and hands from side to side. Women may choose to bring them above their heads, but usually they remain around the torso. Trance music is accompanied by very improvised, flowing arm movements.

, Part of dancing is acting as well.You don’t need to smile the whole time, as this can look forced. Instead, raise your eyebrows slightly and think about the corners of your mouth going upward.


If you are too nervous to have fun, you can look like you are having fun. Sometimes this can actually have the effect of easing your nerves-- your muscles are in an “I’m having fun” configuration, and send the signal to your brain that you are having fun.

, If you attach words to the movements that you make, you will be more likely to remember them. They will also relate to the music that your dance is set to. This creates a new way of thinking about movement. Your movements will often correspond to the mood and tone of the music. If the music is getting quieter, your movements might be getting smaller or lower to the ground. If there is a lot of percussion, you are probably making energetic movements.

, Breathing deeply before you have to dance or go onstage will bring more oxygen to your brain. This will reduce your anxiety. Avoid hyperventilating, or breathing quickly. Take slow, even breaths.

, You may imagine the space that you take up while dancing as a bubble that encompasses your head and length of your arms. As you dance, try to stretch or push at the edges of this bubble. These movements will make you appear more confident, because they will be large and dynamic. Don’t try to “punch through” your bubble, or make any sudden huge movements. Just go a little bit further out than usual.

, If it's a bit difficult in the beginning, dance somewhere inconspicuous. Once you feel more brave, you can work your way to where more people are.


Some people prefer the all-in approach, where you go in to the most crowded part of the dance floor no matter how scared you are. Do whatever makes you comfortable.

, It is easier to dance confidently if you don’t feel alone.


Trade dance moves with your friends. Do something, and then get them to join in with you-- or if they start to do something, join in with them.

, Don't concentrate on the people around you - just dance.


A good way to go about this is to think, “They are too busy worrying about themselves to look at me”. This is always true. When you are dancing in front of people, you are much more worried about how you look than how they look. The same is true for everyone else.

, When you feel self conscious, turn to your friends for help. If you talk to them about feeling nervous, it will take some of the pressure off of you to perform.


It may seem odd, but admitting that you are afraid can sometimes help with feeling afraid. You don’t have to feel uncomfortable in addition to being nervous. Laughing about your nervousness can be an incredible relief. , Self talk is the term for what you say to yourself when you are examining your own behavior. Sometimes it can be a comparison to someone else, and oftentimes it is negative. For example, “She’s such a great dancer. I wish I could dance like that. I’m so dull and boring.”


Instead of going a negative direction, go in a positive one. “She’s such a great dancer. I’m glad I get to see her being herself, it’s so inspirational. I’m going to try to be myself too.”

, Don’t get so caught up in being beautiful or the best that you can’t have fun.


Silly moves like the sprinkler and the shopping cart are just as fun as more mainstream moves like the Dougie. Have fun, and confidence will follow.

Get or make a mirrored ball.,
Consider getting a disco ball motor.,
Hang the motor from the ceiling.,
Position one or two spotlights pointing at the disco ball.,
Get a disco-specific spotlight.",How to Build Disco Lights1," The most iconic disco decoration is the disco ball. They produce moving white dots of light when a spotlight is projected on their surface. You can easily find a disco ball online, or make one of your own.

Note that disco balls come in all sorts of sizes.
If you’re hoping to fill a living or dining room with moving white dots, get a ball that’s about 12 in (30 cm) diameter. For a larger room, get a roughly 20 in (50 cm) disco ball.;
, The disco lighting effect is amplified if you mount the ball on a motor that rotates the ball and moves the dots of light around the room. You can purchase disco balls that come with a motor, or purchase the motor separately online.Be sure to get a motor that can handle the size and weight of your ball. Some motors are designed for small disco balls, while others can handle larger ones.

, Choose a location near the middle of the room that has a horizontal surface you can attach the motor too, such as the ceiling. If the motor is powered by a plug, plan the route that the cord will take. Most disco ball motors will mount to the ceiling with screws.
Keep in mind that there will also be a light aimed at the disco ball, so there must also be an appropriate space to hang a light that will point at the ball.

, There are specific lights designed for use with a disco ball, but many different spotlights will work. The important factor is that the light is focused, or pointed in a particular direction like a spotlight. The effect will be even better if you are able to point two spotlights at the ball from different directions.You can mount the spot lights in many different ways. If you get a spotlight specifically for this purpose, it may even attach to the disco ball's base. It may also have a base of its own that you attach to the ceiling separately.
The ideal distance between the mirrored ball and the spotlight depends on the size of the ball, as well as the size and strength of the light. Experiment with positioning the spotlight in different locations relative to the ball and mount it where it provides the desired effect.

, Some spotlights have features that supplement the lighting effect that is made by the disco ball. For instance, you can get a spotlight that rotates through different colored filters, so that the dots of light moving around the room change color periodically."

Buy an LED light cord.,
Get a bunch of styrofoam or plastic cups.,
Glue cups together side-to-side to form a circle.,
Add consecutive layers with fewer cups each time.,
Push a single bulb into the bottom of each cup.",How to Build Disco Lights2," Another classic disco decoration is a ball of light. To make one of your own, buy an LED light cord from a hardware store or online. You can get a variety of colors, and there are light cords that change color, flash, and even change effects via remote control., These will make up the shell of the ball. They are the perfect material, as they will emanate light, they are extremely cheap, and they are readily available at the grocery store.You will likely need more cups than you think. Of course, this depends on the size of the ball you hope to make, as well as the size of the cups you use.
Get about 100 cups just to make sure you have enough.

, Use a glue gun to apply a vertical strip of glue to the side of a cup, and press another cup against the strip of glue, so that their sides are touching from top to bottom. The openings of the cups will be tilted slightly away from one another, and the bottoms of the cups will point inwards. Continue adding cups in the same way, taking care to keep the cups on the same plane with one another.The specific numbers of cups you will use to complete this first circle is largely up to you. Keep in mind that you will be adding additional layers on top of this circle (with a few less cups each time) to complete a dome.
If you’re using classic water-cooler sized styrofoam cups, use 16 cups to complete your first circle.

, Nestle a cup into the spaces between each of the cups in the circle, using glue to fasten them. Always point the opening of the cup outwards. Repeat this process with additional layers of cups. It will take fewer cups to complete each layer, until you wind up with a completed half dome.As you stack layers, the bottoms of each cup will tilt slightly more inwards towards the center of the dome that is slowly forming.
It may be tricky to hold and glue the final few cups in the dome, so use clothespins to help hold the cups while you glue them in place.
Make another dome in the same way. Together, these two hemispheres can be joined to complete the shell of your light.

, From the inside of your half dome, push an LED bulb into the bottom of each cup, so that the bulb just barely protrudes into the well of the cup.Do the same for other side of the dome as well, then glue the two halves of the dome together with the rest of the LED bulbs balled up inside.
If the LED string is powered by a plug, make sure to run the plug out between some of the cups.

Buy a rotating, flashing, and/or color changing light bulb.,
Install disco light bulbs in fixtures you already have.,
Build your own disco light fixture.",How to Build Disco Lights3," There are all sort of light bulbs that create disco-like effects. You can find these at novelty shops or online. There are even some that create the classic disco effect of a rotating field of dots of light. Search online for things like ""disco light bulb,"" “rotating light bulb,” “magic light bulb,” or “color-changing light bulb.”Amazon has a particularly good selection of this sort of item.
Many of these light bulbs come ready for use. You can simply screw them into a compatible socket and start dancing.

, Believe it or not, building a disco light may be as easy as screwing in a light bulb. For instance, remove the cover from a ceiling fixture and replace the regular bulbs with a rotating one. You can also run lamp cords from power sockets to wherever you want to position a disco light bulb.

Resale or thrift stores are a great place to get light fixtures. You can even remove many of the pieces of an old lamp so you just have a cord with a plug on one end and the bulb receptacle on the other.

, Aside from the disco-themed light bulbs, you’ll need a power cord, lamp holders, a lamp holder base, wire nuts, and a back cover for the base if you want the fixture to be free standing. Cut the socket off of the power cord and connect the wires to the lamp holders with the wire nuts. The wire nuts will be tucked behind the lamp holder base.If you have never wired a light fixture before, have someone who has help you out. Though it may seem intimidating, it’s safe and easy to do.
Never work on the wiring of anything that is plugged in. Keep the plug out of the socket whenever you're working on your disco light.

Add complex footwork.",How to Dance Bachata," Bachata is an 8-beat dance (like the Salsa). Bachata music has four beats per measure. At its most basic, bachata has dancers move left for one four-beat measure, then right for the next. Listen to the music and try to find the pulsing beat. Modern electronic bachata music usually has some form of synth percussion hitting every beat, which makes the beat easy to find. Traditional bachata music can have slightly more complex percussion, but usually still have beats that are easy to ""feel"".


Here's an example of how you'll count your steps during a basic bachata: (Stepping to the left) 1, 2, 3, (4), (stepping to the right) 5, 6, 7, (8), (stepping to the left) 1, 2, 3, (4), etc.. The 4th and 8th beats are marked in parentheses because these beats are often counted silently.
In terms of modern ""pop"" bachata, you might want to check out the work of modern Latino artists like Prince Royce, Anthony Santos, Aventura, Don Omar, and Maite Perroni. These artists are influenced by bachata and many record songs in modernized bachata style. Try starting with ""Creiste"" by Anthony Santos.
Older, more traditional bachata artists may be slightly more obscure today, owing to the popularity of their ""pop"" counterparts. Try checking out artists like Yoskar Sarante, Frank Reyes, and Joe Veras. The song ""Intentalo Tu"" by Joe Veras is a great bachata tune with a semi-traditional flavor.;
, Begin with both your feet together. Count the beat of the music: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. When you're ready, start by stepping to the left with your left foot on beat 1. Then, bring your right foot to your left foot on beat 2. Step left with your left foot again on beat 3, then finally, raise your right foot off the ground slightly on beat 4.

, You may have noticed that by raising your right foot off the ground slightly, you were forced to jut your hips out to the right. This is perfect - eventually, the effect you want to create is that of a continuous, rolling motion in your hips. As you continue to dance, be conscious of the motion of your hips.

, Don't stop! Plant your right foot on the ground on the next beat 1, stepping to the right. Then, just mirror the motions you've already made in the opposite direction: bring your left foot to your right on beat 2, step right on beat 3, and raise your left foot slightly on 4. Your hips should jut to the left now.

, Practice these basic steps until you think you have a sense for the basic pulse of bachata. As you dance, keep your knees slightly bent (obviously bending your knee more when you raise your foot) and try to keep a slight rhythmic swaying motion in your hips.


In bachata, as with many forms of Latin dance, the swaying motion in the hips is typically more pronounced in the female partner than in the male partner.
If you think this is too simple, don't worry - the bachata is about to get much more interesting.

, Knowing how to graciously accept either a ""yes"" or a ""no"" is essential for avoiding awkwardness at clubs, parties, Quinceañeras, and other places where you may want to do the bachata. In traditional bachata, men ask women to dance. The instructions below assume a traditional situation, however, today, it's perfectly acceptable for women to do the asking.


Gentlemen - when you want to dance with someone, be direct, yet courteous. Approach your potential partner directly, offer her your hand (palm up) and say something short and to-the-point along the lines of ""Hey, would you like to dance?"" If she accepts, great! Take her hand and move to the dance floor. If, for any reason, she doesn't want to, politely acquiesce with a short acknowledgement like ""oh, OK. No problem,"" then move on.
Ladies - when you're asked to dance, reply graciously but honestly. If you do want to dance, simply say ""I'd love to"", then take your partner's hand and proceed to the dance floor. If you don't, decline politely, briefly and honestly explaining why you'd rather not. For instance, you might say something like, ""Oh, I wish I could, but my heels are killing me.""

, In Bachata, there are two basic positions for holding your partner - open position and closed position. Open position puts more space between the two partners, as they make contact only through their hands. Open position allows more space and flexibility when it comes to advanced moves like turns. Closed position, on the other hand, is somewhat more intimate, as it involves an arm draped across the lady's back and slight-to-strong contact between the two partners' bodies. Closed position is more common in modern clubs and dance halls owing to cramped floor space. See below for instructions on both positions:


Gentlemen:

For open position, keep your arms loose and relaxed. Offer your lady partner both palms, facing up. She'll gently place her hands in yours - allow them to rest there. Don't grab with your thumbs. Both your and your partners' elbows should be bent at your sides, which will put your bodies about a foot or two apart.
For closed position, wrap your arm around your lady's body so that your palm is resting roughly in the middle of her back. She will drape her arm over yours, resting her hand near your shoulder. Using your unoccupied arm (which is called your ""leading arm""), hold her other hand out to the side at about shoulder or chest height, keeping both of your elbows bent. Don't interlock fingers - your hands should be held palm-on-palm, with the back of your hand facing out. As you dance, use your outstretched hand to lead your partner, gently guiding her upper body in the direction you're moving.


Ladies:

For open position, keep your arms loose and relaxed. Lay your hands palms-down in your partner's. Remember to keep your elbows bent to allow flexibility and ensure you're somewhat close to your partner.
For closed position, when your partner wraps his arm around your back, lay your arm over his and rest it near his shoulder. Allow your partner to hold your other hand - the back of your hand should be facing towards you, while the back of his should be facing out. Keep your elbows bent and remember to keep a palm-palm hand hold (don't interlock fingers).



, Practice simply moving in time to the music with your partner. You may find that coordinating your movements so that you both step on the beat is harder than you first thought! Regardless of whether you're in open or closed position, both partners perform basically the same ""left four beats, right four beats"" motion described above. However, realize that, since both partners are facing each other, one partner will be stepping in the opposite direction as described.


Traditionally, in bachata, the man leads, so, if you're a lady, you can just follow in the direction of his motion, whether that means stepping to the right or to the left first.

, As your bachata skill improves and you begin dancing with partners, you'll want to move away from the basic left-and-right bachata steps and towards a more advanced, versatile step pattern that uses back-and-forth movements as well. These back and forth movements are done almost identically to the left-and-right movements - in other words, you'll step forward three beats and pop your hips on beat four, then step backward 3 beats and pop your hips on beat four, lather, rinse, and repeat. As the leading partner steps forward, the following partner steps back with the corresponding foot.


For beginners, try moving through the basic left-and-right bachata steps twice, then doing a back-and-forth motion twice, then switching back to the left-and-right motion and repeating. Your steps should be as follows:

(To the left) 1, 2, 3, (4) (To the right) 1, 2, 3, (4), (To the left) 1, 2, 3, (4) (To the right) 1, 2, 3, (4)
(To the front) 1, 2, 3, (4), (To the back) 1, 2, 3, (4), (To the front) 1, 2, 3, (4), (To the back) 1, 2, 3, (4)
(To the left) 1, 2, 3, (4), (To the right)... and so on.


Note - because, in traditional bachata, the male partner leads, the (to the front) direction refers to his point of view. The female (or following) partner will step back as the leading partner steps forward, and vice versa.

, One of the most essential partner moves done in bachata is the turn. In the most basic variation of this move, the male partner raises his arm, allowing the woman to complete a full turn in time to the music, then both partners return to normal dancing without missing a beat. Follow the instructions below to do a basic turn:


Gentlemen - As you dance, mentally count out the beat (1, 2, 3, 4). On beat 4, begin to raise your leading arm over your partner's head and begin to release your other arm's grip (as a reminder, in closed position, the leading arm is the outstretched one, rather than the one wrapped around your partner's back). On beat 1 of the next measure, your partner will begin to turn in a circle under your arm, gently holding on to your leading arm as she does so. She will finish turning on beat 3 so that on beat 4 you'll both be dancing in sync again and you'll be able to move together in the opposite direction on the next beat 1.
Ladies - feel your partner's leading arm begin to rise on beat 4. Keep holding onto your partner's leading arm, but release your grip on your partner's shoulder with your other arm and move under the curve of his leading arm. On beat 1, start to turn in a circle under his leading arm. Try to finish turning on beat 3 so that you can hit beat 4 in the ""normal"" dancing position and step together in the opposite direction on beat 1.

, Above all else, bachata is supposed to be a way for two people to have fun. Both men and women should try to give their partner their full attention. At the simplest level, this means looking at your partner while you dance, not at the floor (and especially not at other people you'd like to dance with). However, this also applies to the way you dance:


Pay attention to your partner's movements. if you're leading, make sure your partner is keeping up with you. If you're following, try to match your partner's directions and predict which way he'll go next.
When your partner does a glamorous move like a spin or a turn, give your partner the attention s/he deserves. Generally, unless you're doing a special synchronized two-person move, you shouldn't do your own moves while your partner is doing his or hers.

, Bachata shouldn't be a dreary shuffle - it should be an upbeat, energetic dance. As your bachata skill grows, try to incorporate more of your body into your basic step patterns. For instance, rather that keeping your upper body mostly straight, try moving your arms in a pumping motion and twisting slightly as you move. Try bending your knees and popping your hips more than you normally would for a low, sensual swaying motion. Eventually, when you're comfortable, the bachata should naturally become a whole-body activity.

, At most modern dance clubs, you'll encounter a casual, modernized version of bachata, rather than the formal, traditional version. This version of the dance, called ""bachata urbana"", incorporates a wide variety of added moves and minor variations to give bachata an updated, modern feel. Below are instructions for two bachata urbana moves that can give your dance routine some modern flair.


The slide - This move is usually performed when you would normally be stepping in the opposite direction as the leading arm (typically, this arm is the leading partner's left arm, so this means you'll do this move when you'd normally step to his right). To do this move, mentally count the beat of the music (1, 2, 3, 4). On beat 4 of the ""to the left"" measure, the leading partner raises his leading arm so that his hand and his partner's are above their heads. On beat 1 of the ""to the right measure,"" he drops his leading hand to below the waist, takes a big step back with his rear leg, and slides backward until beat 4. The following partner mirrors his movements.
The male turn - This move allows the leading male partner to enjoy a flashy turn for a change. The male turn works especially well right after a traditional female turn, so we'll assume you've just ""caught"" your turning partner on beat 4. On beat 1, start to turn in front of your partner - she doesn't need to raise her hand over you like you would while she's turning. As you turn, she should keep her elbows bent and her hands out in front of her. This way, as you turn, you can grab her non-leading arm with your leading arm so that, for a brief moment, you're both holding hands and facing the same way with your back to her front. Continue turning and ""catch"" her hands as you normally would on beat 3 so that on beat 4 you're dancing in sync again.

, When two experienced bachata dancers dance with each other, they're unlikely to be content with the basic ""left, right, front, back"" steps for long. As you grow as a bachata dancer, for added challenge and entertainment, you'll probably want to start throwing new, more complex footwork patterns into your repertoire. Here are just a few ideas you may want to practice:


Heel steps. Typically, on the fourth beat of each measure, you'll raise your foot slightly and roll your hips to the side. Instead, try kicking your foot out slightly so that its heel touches the ground and its toes are raised. You may need to bend your knees slightly to do this comfortably. The end result should be somewhat subtle - not an exaggerated ""Cossack dance"" kick, but slight variation on your normal step.
Twisting. Instead of stepping back and forth, spend a measure twisting with your partner. Bend your knees slightly more than usual, then twist your hips and legs side to side to the beat of the music. Try varying between twisting twice per measure (once every two beats) and twisting four times per measure (once every beat).
Leg-crosses. This move incorporates several kicks followed by a quick turn for a dazzling effect. Step to the side as you normally would for three beats. On beat 4, raise your leg slightly more than normal in preparation for a kick. On beat 1, keeping your upper body upright, gently kick out in front of you. Your leg should swing back on beat 2. Kick out again on beat 3, then, on beat four, cross your kicking leg across your stationary leg and plant it on the ground. Use your momentum to complete a full turn on beats 1, 2, and 3 of the next measure so that you're back in your ""normal"" position on beat 4.

Stretch.,
Turn on the right music.,
Get in a starting position.,
Lift your arms and flex your stomach slightly.",How to Belly Dance1," Getting warmed up before you start to dance will keep you from straining a muscle or getting injured. Just bend down to touch your toes, roll your neck and shoulders, and stretch your wrists to feel nice and loose. If you can do a backbend, do one to help stretch out your stomach muscles.


As you get ready to belly dance, you should put your hair up and wear a shirt that exposes your belly.
Practice dancing in front of a mirror so you can monitor your movements.;
, Any music with a strong repetitive base will help get you in the right frame of mind. Try to use some music of Middle Eastern origin and gain an understanding of the rhythms. There are many pieces of Arabic music that are composed specifically for belly dance and contain musical cues which will help you to understand when to make earthy movements and when to make flowing, graceful movements. Being able to dance to middle eastern music will help you to gain appreciation for belly dance.

, Begin in a position so that your upper body is straight. Don't arch your back or hunch. Tuck in your butt so that it also aligns with your back. Bend your knees slightly and never, ever, lock them. Your feet should be parallel and about a foot apart. Your chin should be raised slightly, and your shoulders should be bent gently back.

, Use your stomach muscles to 'pull' or lead your hip movement; the lower back should not have a large arch. Some schools insist on the stomach pulling from the start, in order to train your stomach. Lift your arms in the air so that they're slightly above parallel to the ground and lift your wrists slightly.

Then, take four steps back with your right foot first. Repeat., Nod on beat 1 and skip on 2 . Repeat the nodding again on beat 3 and 4. This part should begin when Michael Jackson starts to sing., This step should begin directly after the nodding on beat 4. Put one arm in front of you and one behind you. Your arms should be straightened. Then, bend your knees. Put your bottom out and wiggle it up and down. Next, take a step forward and wiggle., Your fingers should be outstretched, separated, and bent. Move your hand forward and then pull them back as if you were ripping through a bush. Repeat two times then switch the side you're clawing at., Stand still and upright. Throw your head back and lean back a bit with one leg in front if you. Then, hop forward twice. Once you’ve hopped, bend your knees slightly, one leg out, with the other to the side. Put your hand on your belt. The other hand will be out straight to your side., Go down with your whole body. The reason it is called 'down ha!' is because when you come back up you make a face like you are yelling Ha! Repeat this move four times., Right after ""down ha!"" bring your hands up and clap them directly over your head. Clapping noises should be made in the music at this point. Bring them down slowly and drag your feet to one side. Shrug your shoulders and turn your head to the side. Repeat the move in the other direction., There will be an 8 count pause where you can do any zombie-like moves you want. Next, shake your hands in front of you. Do a disco pose with one hand up and one down.Pose and change position every two counts. You can put your “claws” up and pose, or do a disco pose.
Choose a partner and dance together for the duration of the eight counts.
Spend eight counts walking slowly and creepily to a new spot.

, Put your “claws” out to the side start walking forward 3 counts. Then, turn to the other side and walk back. Now, you should be walking the direction you came from originally. Move for 3 counts., Then bend over and try to touch your toes two times. Pause and pose for four counts, jump to the other side, and then repeat. Then, turn around and throw one hand over your head. Swivel your feet for a beat. Then bring your arm back up and bring it down, but this time it should stop and take 5 counts to make it down. Grab the air on one side of you then punch it four times on your other side., Then, turn your body around with 6 steps until you are facing the other direction. Look behind you and slap your leg then take 10 steps backwards. You're trying to time this to exactly before the chorus starts for the second time in the song because that is where your next step comes in. Go slower or faster depending on how close you are to the chorus., Get very into the Thriller dance by dressing up like a zombie. First, look for some old clothes that you won’t wear anywhere. You can wear pants or a skirt and shirt. Or, you can wear a dress. The choice is yours. 1980s style clothing is ideal because that’s the decade Thriller came out. Use scissors or your hands to tear them up so that they look very old.You can find cheap clothes at a thrift shop if you don’t have any clothes you’re willing to rip up.

, A zombie will probably not have very neat hair. Run your fingers through your hair to make it very untidy. You can use a comb to tease your hair into different directions. Use hairspray to get the unkempt hairstyle to hold.Place a few leaves or twigs in your hair if you want step up the zombie-like appearance.

, Your goal with your makeup is to make it look like you’ve been long dead and rotting. Wear very light foundation to give you a pale appearance. Use dark eye shadow or black eyeliner to create dark circles around your eyes. Apply more of the dark eye shadow to your cheeks to make them look gaunt. Next, take purple and reddish eye shadow and apply it to look like wounds around your face.You can buy fake wound kits at many costume stores.
Wear zombie contacts for an extra creepy appearance.

, A zombie costume is not complete without fake blood. Purchase fake blood from costume, or make it out of red food coloring, water, and corn syrup. Spread the blood on your face, arms, and legs if they are exposed. Pour it on your torn clothes, and pour a small amount into your hair. Make sure that the fake blood does not irritate your skin before putting a lot of it on your skin.Mix in some dirt into the blood to look extra dirty.

, Thriller is a dance best performed with a group of people. Get a group of friends together that are willing to learn the dance with you. You can get together as few or as many friends as you would like to do the Thriller. Learn the dance moves together and practice until everyone is confident in their memory of them.You can designate one person to act as Michael Jackson and be the lead.

, You can sing or mouth the words as you perform. If you don’t want to sing, it is still good to learn the words in order to know when to perform your moves.You can choose to have the person acting as Michael Jackson to be the only one that sings the words.

, It is important to have the music playing as you perform. Purchase the song, or play it on a streaming service like YouTube or Spotify. You can set up a computer, or put out speakers to play the music. If you choose to sing, play the karaoke version of the song., Show off your hard work by performing the dance for other people. You can plan to break out in dance at a party, or plan to perform at an event. Make sure it okay to perform the dance at the place and time you choose.It is also an option to plan a Thriller flash mob.

Stand with your legs shoulder width apart.,
Lean forward 45 degrees.,
Swivel your hips right to left.,
Continue to twist your hips, swiveling them faster and faster.",How to Booty Pop2," Place your hands on your hips.


It may help to stand in front of a mirror to the side you can watch your hips and booty as they move.
If you have access to a wall, it may also be helpful to stand in front of the wall for balance.

, Keep the weight in your toes.

, You can lift your heels to help you move your hips and keep your hands in front of you or against the wall to help you balance as you lean forward and twist your hips.

, Isolate the bottom half of your body so you are not moving your upper body at all, just your hips, legs, and booty.


Shift your weight back and forth on your toes, twisting your hips, until you get a nice shake to your booty.
Turn on some good booty shaking music and try out your new dance move.

Stand in front of a wall with your feet shoulder width apart.,
Bend down and place your hands directly in front of you on the floor.,
Lean forward and place your weight on your hands.,
Press your leg against the wall and make sure you have a good grip on the wall with your foot.,
Come onto your toes.,
Speed up the booty pop.,
Come out of the handstand booty pop slowly and carefully.",How to Booty Pop3," You should be facing away from the wall. Make sure you have enough wall space to put your legs on the wall.Keep in mind this is a more advanced booty pop variation, so be sure to practice the basic booty pop first before trying out this variation.

, Keep your legs slightly bent. Your booty should now be against the wall or a few inches away from the wall.

, Lift one leg up and crawl it up the wall.

, Then, slowly crawl your other leg up the wall. You should now be upside down with both legs against the wall.


Keep your legs shoulder width apart on the wall.
Press into your palms to help maintain your balance.

, Using the wall for balance, arch your lower back so your hips move forward and up and then hollow out your lower back so your hips move in and down.


Continue pushing your hips forward and up and then in and down to get a good upside down booty pop.

, Once you feel comfortable twerking upside down, speed up the booty pop and allow gravity to do most of the work for you as you move your hips forward and up and then in and down.


Put on your favorite booty popping dance track and twerk away, upside down.

, Once you’ve had your fill of upside down booty pops and/or your arms start to get tired from booty shaking, lower one leg down to the ground first and then lower the other leg down to the ground.


Bend your legs and lift your upper body up slowly so you are back in the standing position.

Master the side to side move and the back and forth move.,
Make small circular movements with one side of your hips at a time.,
Combine your moves.",How to Belly Dance2," For the side to side move, just drop your left hip to raise your right hip, and then drop your right hip to raise your left. Start slowly until you perfect this motion, and then speed up until you're shimmying your hips. For the back and forth move, just move your hips back and forth, using the center of your pelvis to make the movement look graceful.


Keep your arm lifted at a ninety degree angle and move your fingers to add balance and grace to your movements.
To move side to side, first lift your right foot and lift your heel until only your toes are touching the ground. Use this movement to pop up your right hip for two counts, and then let it fall lower than normal for two counts. Repeat this movement with your left leg and hip and then alternate until you can shimmy rapidly.
Use your knees to help generate momentum and movement, not your hips.
To master the hip movement, try to mentally divide your torso vertically down the center. This will help you learn to move one side of your hip up and down without affecting the movement of the other hip.

, Try 'drawing' little circles in the air with your one side. As you get the hang of it, try 8's, arcs, and swirls. Don't forget your other side. One side will always be easier, or stronger, depending on whether you are left or right handed. Keep your arms lifted, a slight smile on your face, and your fingers moving as you master these techniques.

, You don't have to belly dance using the same motion all the time. Once you master a few techniques, you can switch things up. Do the left hip circle, the right hip circle, two right hip circles followed by two left, or move your hips back and forth and then transition into moving them from side to side. Remember to continue using your stomach to pull your hips in different directions.

"

Practice making the stomach ripples that cause the back and forth movements.,
Try isolating or clenching each muscle individually.",How to Belly Dance3," There are three main muscles that you will use: (1) a crescent shaped muscle just above the pubic area; (2) The area between the 1st muscle and below the navel; (3) just above the navel to your ribs (the one that hurts when you laugh too hard).

, Isolate the first muscle group, then the second, and then the third. Once you can isolate and clench these muscles, you'll be on your way to doing the stomach ripple. Work on clenching and releasing them individually and then combine the movements.

Practice often.",How to Dance Like the Rockettes," The jazz split is a variation of the traditional split; it involves putting your chest as far as possible down to your leg. This stretch not only helps get your legs limber to go as high as possible––it also helps keep you to maintain great posture, keeping your chest upright when standing up.;
, This is the opposite of a front kick (the type the rockettes do). Lean forward and place your hands on the ground, as close as possible to your foot. Keeping the bottom leg straight, whip your other leg as high as you can to try to get it over your head. Make sure to keep that leg straight too!

, Place your foot as high as you can on a wall, then bring your chest onto your leg. Try to eventually have your whole leg on the wall. This will help keep your kicks high.

, Holding onto a chair or a person, kick as high as you can while keeping your legs straight. A 60 degree kick with straight legs is better than a 180 degree kick with bent legs. Focus on doing the kick with straight legs rather than getting your leg up high. Squeeze all the muscles in your legs as you kick. Make sure to point your toes.


There are two types of kicks: Stagged then straight, and straight the whole time. Stagged then straight refers to the position when the dancer bring up their legs bent to the required height, then straightens them. It's slightly harder than doing a straight kick all the way, but with practice, it will become easy. Straight kicks refer to the position when you bring your leg up to the required height, but keeping them straight all the way. This is the type of kick done in the kick lines.

, The reason the Rockettes are synchronized is not because they are looking at each other––it is because they are all counting at the same time, at the same beat. Keeping steady is essential, not only in kick lines, but for things dependent on others. For example, if you do a wave, you have to wait two seconds before doing yours.

, How do the Rockettes have such perfect upper bodies? By doing extreme amounts of push-ups and planks. Work on them a lot and make sure you do them properly, with perfect form.

,


When do they usually do their kick line?
How do they kick? Just with straight legs or with some bent too?
What other moves do they do?
What type of music do they dance to?

, Although the Rockettes are girls, not all of your dancers need be girls. While it is best to have a fairly large group of people, it is possible to do this with just two people. If you are dancing with people a variety of sizes, put the tallest people in the middle, while the shortest people go on the end. To make your line seem even, pay attention to things like leg length. Kicks should all be at eye-level. This will make them seem all the same height.

, Clothing such as skinny jeans is a big no-no. You want to be able to move around freely. Choose clothing that is casual, and loose-fitting.

, The counter is someone who counts aloud for the first time to keep everyone  in time. This person must be able to keep a steady beat and have a loud voice.

, When dancing for fun, many people will join by the shoulders, though the real Rockettes either bend their arms or keep them straight and place them around the closest person's waist.

, You can check YouTube to find the type of music the Rockettes dance to. Just type in ""Rockettes Music,"" and results will come up. Connect your computer/phone/iPod to a speaker, and crank up the volume!

, Using the preparation methods outlined in Part 1, kick as high and as well as you can. Kick to the count of the counter. Turn slightly every time you kick (toward the direction in which you are kicking you leg)..

, To dance for a performance, you will need an instructor and other girls to practice with. Search online for ""Rockettes' training, (your zipcode or city)"".

, You may need a different outfit for every performance. Rockettes typically wear short dresses (almost leotards) with skin colored tights, though your performance may require different attire. In addition, some performances feature tap-dancing as well, so you many need tap-shoes (heeled or traditional).

, When dancing for a performance, Rockettes do not only do a kickline, they also do a ripple effect, kickline in a circle, walking back and forth, etc.)


To create a ripple effect: stand in a straight line, with great posture. Staring at the end of the line, fall into your pose directly after the person in front of you has.
To do a circle kickline: stand in a circle. Put your arms right above each other's shoulders, and kick with your leg. After kicking, step forwards.

, Strange as this may seem, if one of you is tired and pulls the other down, it can mess up the entire line. Make it seem as if you are touching by putting your arm about two inches away.

, Often when the Rockettes pose, their hand is anywhere between a 75 to 90 degree angle. This is very important. When flicking your hand down into pose, start with your hand bent slightly backwards, to add flair.

, If you are even one beat behind, it will reflect badly on the entire group. Make sure to count inside your head at a steady beat. Listen to the music, as you usually dance to the beat of the music.

, Practice and patience are key to dancing like a Rockette. Rockettes work much harder then most people realize. Daily practice is essential.

Apply your new-found Beyonce moves out in the world.",How to Dance Like Beyonce," Hip hop dancing relies a lot on the contrast between loose, flowing moves and quick, jerky ones. Generally, the hips are kept loose while the arms and hands perform sudden, dramatic movements, though quick hip moves are not uncommon either. The first step to making your dancing more hip hop-like is to embrace this contrast., Popping and locking are two dance styles that provide a foundation for a lot of hip hop dance technique. Learning the basics of both will allow you to quickly look more like Beyonce while dancing.Popping: This is a bouncy style of dancing that requires the isolation of body parts, moving them in succession, to the beat. To perform popping, imagine a wave moving through your body, making your body parts move one after another.
Locking: The basic concept of locking is to move quickly and then freeze, and then continue moving at the same speed as before. This can be applied to both the whole body or to one body part at a time. Usually, locking involves jerky arm movements and a looser hip area, which moves to the beat.

, Once you understand the basics of popping and locking, you can learn a few basic hip hop moves that will get you started. These moves are the kind of things they'll teach you at almost any beginner's hip hop dancing class.Hip step: Start in the standard position with your feet shoulder length apart and knees slightly bent. Kick one foot out in front of you, then swing it to the outside of your other foot, crossing your legs. Then uncross your legs by moving your other foot back into standard position. Repeat in the other direction.
Slide and step: From the standard position, move your feet closer together. Then step far to the side with one foot. Slide the other foot towards the first foot and then step it back into place next to the first foot. Then repeat in the other direction.
Arm cross: Lean your torso forward a bit. Spread your arms in either direction, outwards but still pointing toward the floor. Then swing your arms both in and cross them in front of you. Move your hips back and forth to the beat as you do this.

, Videos like ""Single Ladies"" or ""Crazy In Love"" demonstrate some of her most recognizable moves. The more you watch and pay close attention to how she dancing, the better you'll be able to replicate it. Study her movements and take notes, either in your head or one paper.

, The chorus to ""Flawless"" has a very recognizable dance routine. It's very interesting visually but at the same time not too difficult to learn.Step up and down in place with your right foot three times. As you do, hold your hands up, fingers spread, near your shoulders and flip them over with your stomping foot.
Lean to the right with your whole torso and thighs, bending your knees. Hold your head in your hands with your elbows pointing out as you do. Lean back twice before returning to your original position.
Repeat the stomp and hand turn move. Then do the lean move again, but only once. Instead of leaning back a second time, cross your right foot over to the left, fluidly moving your body back into front position. As you do, hold your torso low and wave your left hand in front of your face.
Repeat the stomp and hand turn move a third time. Then move backwards by bouncing on your left foot, with your right foot slightly lifted. As you do, spread your arms out on either side with your hands extended.

, Her popular music video for the song ""Single Ladies"" contains some simple but entrancing signature dance moves. Practice these moves by simulating them in front of a full length mirror.


Execute ""The Spank"" by moving your hands in a wide, circular pattern above your head. Then bring them down to meet your backside with a light swat.
Perform ""The Pump Walk"" by walking in one direction with your heels lifted while simultaneously punching towards the ground.
Learn to do the ""Hip Shake"" by positioning your feet wide apart, your arms and hands above your head, and shaking your hips from side to side.
Dance to the ""Wind Down"" by keeping your legs wide apart and moving your shoulders, torso, hips and arms while simultaneously lowering yourself to the ground.
Accomplish the ""Pussy Cat Crouch"" immediately after the ""Wind Down."" Once you're as far down as you can go you bring your legs together then arch your back while returning to the standing position.
Perform ""Put A Ring On It"" by two-stepping side to side and then pointing to your ring finger.

, The opening dance move in Beyonce's ""Run the World"" is easy to learn and hard to master. The movements are simple but fast and jerky. You perform it by moving your shoulders up and down quickly, twice as fast as the beat. As you do that, your head should spin from side to side with the beat.As with all these moves, practice it while watching the video to get the particulars right.

, Beyonce's video for ""7/11"" doesn't include one or two iconic dance routines, but instead includes a variety of shorter, but nonetheless appealing dance moves. This makes it a good video to copy from. Some of the moves include:


Clap your hands above your head as you bounce forward with your feet together.
Bend yourself back and to the side by leaning your torso backwards and bending your knees. Rock your arms in a fluid, rolling movement up and down while you're bent back.
Spread your feet very far apart and get your torso low. Move your hips from side to side as you do.

, Beyonce consistently performs her dances in heels. In fact, she even wears heels while rehearsing, to make sure you can do the real thing flawlessly in stilettos. If you want to really mimic Beyonce on the dance floor, you'll have to get comfortable moving quickly and fluidly in heels. So start by just practicing at home with your high heels on.Dancing in heels can be dangerous, so it's best to stretch your feet thoroughly before strapping your heels on.

, Locate a studio near you that specializes in hip-hop dancing. Schedule lessons with trained instructors, who can teach you how to duplicate some of Beyonce's dance moves. Beyonce's dancing is a style all of her own, but it's based in hip hop dancing, so increasing your familiarity with hip hop dance will make you look more like Beyonce when dancing., It may seem unintuitive, but you can get a lot closer to dancing like Beyonce by taking ballet lessons. For one, the similarities between dancing in heels and dancing ballet are striking. Ballet will strengthen your legs and especially your calves, which is necessary to get better at dancing in heels. Also, learning ballet will make you a better, more graceful dancer in general. You'll learn greater control of your body and its movement. And Beyonce's dancing is anything if not graceful and controlled., As a tongue-in-check internet trend has revealed, Beyonce's dances are very flexible.So when you're out dancing, don't be afraid to apply some of Beyonce-style dancing to different types of music. Dancing is a very individualistic activity, so experiment.


Try sprinkling some of the specific Beyonce dance moves in with your normal casual club dancing.
Try applying some of hip-hop dancing techniques to other types of music, like electronic music. See what feels right and go with it!
Try taking inspiration from Beyonce's moves to make your own Beyonce-style choreography to a song with a friend or two.

In your notebook, pay attention to every little detail and if you practice, you will improve. Get the gist of the moves in your sad so you know you're going in the right direction.

, Your instructor may make corrections and give you helpful tips. Know what you're supposed to wear and how to do your hair, as this is very important too! Bring your notebook to rehearsal in case anything changes.

, Hand them your notebook and crank up the music and ask them to pay close attention. Let them make corrections, and list the pros and cons of your dance. You will also get good practice in front of an audience.

, Ask her how you did and listen carefully and hang on to every word she/he says.

, Smile and enjoy, but have your parent's, friend's, and instructor's voice echoing you head, and say the steps in your head as you do them. You should do fine and make each and every move just perfect!

Decide how you will conclude your dance solo.,
Practice your dance solo.,
Ask a friend or family member.",How to Make a Dance Solo," If you're auditioning for a highly technical dance company, the goal of your dance solo may be to present your advanced technical ability. On the other hand, a dance solo for a community event may be geared towards entertaining others.;
, When auditioning for a traditional ballet company, select classical music or a piece that you would commonly dance to in your ballet classes. If you will perform the dance solo at a social or community event, choose music that will appeal to audience members. Some contemporary dances are performed to recitation of words or in the case of a step dance, you would create your own music through clapping and stomping.

, Not all dance pieces must have a theme. Some choreographic pieces are intended to dazzle through high-energy movements or move others through awe-inspiring gracefulness. However, if you are planning to tell a story through movement or convey a concept, define it at the outset.

, Depending on the theme of your dance piece, it may be more powerful to burst onto the stage after the lights are up and the music has started. Alternatively, you might stand on center stage and begin to dance as the lights come up and the music starts.

,


Tell a story through dance movement. Your story may be about having lost something and the joy of finally finding it. Your movements may mirror specific words in the music lyrics. You might make use of props to tell your story.
Highlight your technical abilities. Each dancer has specific strengths. Some are highly flexible. Others are extremely strong. Some dancers have a combination of these qualities and more. Use the middle section of your dance solo to highlight your technical strengths, without taking away from the main theme of your dance piece.
Use the dance space effectively. Perform your most impressive movements in center stage so they can easily be seen. Avoid performing movements that cannot be seen, such as lying down on a stage that is not elevated. If you are performing on a large stage, use as much of the space as possible.
Consider the dynamics of your dance solo. Take advantage of dramatic changes in the music. Incorporate movements that take you off of the ground in leaps, take you to the floor and back to center stage. To keep the audience's attention, avoid excessive stillness and stagnation in a solo, unless it is done deliberately to convey a story or concept.

, You might end in a dynamic pose on the last beat of the music. The music may end as your graceful movements gradually stop. Or you might dance off the stage as the music fades.

, In a group dance, if you forget the movements, you can follow others. In a dance solo, you don't have this luxury. Repeated rehearsal will help you memorize the dance solo and increase the fluidity and expressiveness of your movements.

, If your dance is to much/little for the occasion, you'll want to know. Make sure you have at least two people to preview your dance, just so you won't embarrass yourself."

Revise your choreography.",How to Choreograph a Dance," Is there a specific message you wish to get across or a mood you hope to convey. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in a journal, on your computer, or in a notes app on your phone. As you begin choreographing, refer to these early brainstorming sessions for inspiration and direction.Get inspired by other performances. Devote sometime to watching street performers, YouTube videos, and classical recitals. Watch old musicals and modern music videos.;
, When choreographing a dance, it is important to know your audience. Who are you performing for? What kind of dance are they expecting? As a choreographer, it is also essential that you take the venue and event into consideration. Will the dancers be on a stage, on a gym floor, or outdoors? Will your piece be performed at a recital or at the halftime of your high school’s basketball game? The answers to these questions will influence the content of your dance number.

, There are hundreds of styles to choose between. You could choreograph a hip-hop routine or a fiery flamenco. Pick a style that suits your skills and the talents of your dancers. If you’re feeling daring, try creating a mash-up. Combine and mesh multiple styles into one stellar routine.


Choose a style that is fun and that you and your dancers are comfortable with.

, Selecting a song that complements the dance style is essential. While classical songs work well for ballet, hip-hop routines generally require more modern tunes. The song should inspire your creativity, motivate you to move, and intrigue your audience.Don’t be afraid to select an out-of-the-box song. Sometimes taking a risk can be very rewarding. Listen to new artists or artists from different countries.
View dance covers of the song. Watch videos of other people dancing to the song. Get some ideas from them, but if you want to keep it original, don't copy the dance.

, Are you creating a beautiful solo or a daring duet? Do you feel inspired to create a complex group number or a dance simple enough for a flash mob? Decide how many dancers you will need in order to convey your message to the audience.


Be flexible! If your dancers are volunteers, you may not get as many willing participants as you had originally hoped.

, Knowing the song inside and out is important to the creation process. Listen to the song hundreds of times. Focus on different aspects of the music each time--zone in on the rhythms one time and the harmonies the next. Let the piece of music inspire your choreography.


Listen to the song during your daily commute.
Put it on repeat while you are at the gym.
Try slowing the song down. Use an app or other software to make the song into slow motion. This will help you create dance moves for each verse step by step. You will probably have to move in slow motion as well.

, After becoming intimately acquainted with the music, start analyzing it. Divide the song into sections. Name each section and identify when a section repeats. List the mood(s) of each section, note the energy level, volume, and intricate rhythms.

, Familiarize yourself with the genre of dance you have selected. You should know everything from the correct hold to the basic steps. Create a list of steps, moves, and sequences that are not only genre appropriate, but that also fit the song. Use this list as a reference when you choreograph the routine.


Study the choreography of dances from the same genre. Find YouTube clips of hip-hop routines, jives, and tangos. You can also find live performances in your home town.
If you are looking to add a bit of flair to your routine, try incorporating dance moves from different genres!

, Try out different steps, moves, and sequences. Experiment with combining them in different patterns. Place these components at different points in the song. To prevent forgetting the combinations, record yourself and review the footage later.If you fashion your own steps, be sure to give them names that won't make it hard for you to remember what they are.
Don't be afraid to try something silly or off-the-wall. New, and possibly odd, movements can make a piece unique and special.
Make sure the dance moves fit the song. Try to make the movements coordinate with the style and message of the song.

, Combine the steps, moves, and sequences to form a section. Create each dance section with a specific section of the music in mind. Interpret the music through your movement and facial expressions--musicality is important. Make sure the individual dance sections have a unifying theme or character. Continuity will ensure that the sections do not appear disjointed or disconnected. Repeating certain sections, or variations of themes, throughout the piece can help unify your routine., Once you have choreographed the major sections of your dance, create transitions. Transitions should not disrupt the piece, but link the sections seamlessly. While transitions are not the star of your piece, they should never be boring or dull. Find creative ways to move from section to section.

, Decide if it is necessary to use props in your routine--props should never be an afterthought. Use them to aid and enhance your movement. Costumes can also be used to show off your choreography. A flow-y skirt can accentuate a spin or convey an emotion. Sounds too can enhance your routine. Yelling, snapping, stomping, and singing can add an additional dimension to your piece. Use them sparingly, but consistently.Your props and costumes should make sense--they should match the style of the dance. Props and costumes should never distract your audience from watching the performance.

, Before rehearsing, prepare for the session by writing out the routine. Include as many details about the steps as you feel are necessary. Feel free to use your own shorthand. Note particularly tricky passages that may require you to spend additional time explaining and demonstrating. Be organized and prepared., Practice makes perfect. Remember, practice your routine over and over and over and over. Be patient with your dancers and remain positive. Stay flexible and remain open to altering your choreography if something is not working. Don’t be afraid to accept input from others.Go through the dance slowly at first. Pick up the pace as the dancers feel more comfortable.
When practicing, be enthusiastic so when it comes to the real thing, it feels natural.
Make sure you and the dancers are properly warmed-up before rehearsal.

, Rehearse your piece on the stage or floor you will be performing. Record your practice. Decide how your dancers will enter and exit the stage. Determine where on the floor the dancers should be at various points of the dance--alter your transitions if necessary. During this process, it is important that you step away from the stage and view the piece from the audience’s position. Make sure none of the dancers are obstructed by the building or props.

, After reviewing the footage from your staged rehearsal, revise your choreography. Perfect the steps and transitions. Make note of areas in which your dancers could improve--are they conveying the proper emotion? Bring your notes to rehearsal and work with your dancers to make the necessary changes.


Don’t make too many alterations to the choreography. This can frustrate your dancers and lead to a stressful first performance. Make necessary changes only!

The more ready you are, the easier it will be to spring into action once the music starts, which is very impressive.;
, Once the music starts sweep the fedora on your head. At the same time, jump so that you face left, putting your weight on your bent right leg. Your left leg will be bent and touching the ground a foot in front of your right foot, your toe on the ground.









Your left hand should be resting about where a belt buckle would be. Your right hand should be splayed in front of your face after you put the hat on.
You can slowly lower your right hand during the first moments of the song for dramatic effect.

, When the heavy percussion begins, spring into the first move. Whirl your right arm in a circle, so that it swings behind you on the beat of one. Keep it extended there. At the same time, your left foot and your pelvis should move back, for the beginning part of the thrusting motion.









Your pelvis should move back on the downbeat (1 and 3) and up on the upbeat (2 and 4). You will do this for four counts of four.

, Exit the thrusting on the third beat of the fourth repetition by jumping the legs closer together. Then kick out your right leg. Hit the top of your leg to emphasize the kick.









The kick should come on the downbeat (1). This is about the time the “ch-sh-sh” sound happens on the track.

, This will take one beat, ending on an upbeat (2). Your back should be facing the audience. Once your back is turned, extend your right arm out to the right and your left near your left hip, which should be jutting out to the left to counterbalance your extended arm.









Remember to stylize your fingers, splaying them and holding one in toward your palm. You don’t want to look like you’re going for a high five.
Don’t hold too long here. Move quickly onto the next step.

, Circle your left arm and extend it to your side. Bend both of your legs, with the left leg bent and pointing to the left, resting on its toe. You want the audience to see the profile of your leg.









Your right hand should be near your crotch. Keep your left fingers stylized.
Hold this for one beat, then move on to the next move.

, This will be on the upbeat (4). Repeat the kick and spin on the left side, starting on beat 1.









Jump your feet together, so that the rest of your body faces to the right. Then kick with your left leg. Roll your hands as you turn to face the audience and shoot your left arm to the left as you completely face forward. Finish with with your right arm spinning and extending to the right. Keep your right leg bent and resting on its toe.
Remember to keep your hands stylized. The left hand ends on the crotch.

, Then cross the left leg in front of the right. At the same time, swing the arms across your middle in an X. Bring your head down and swing your arms back to your sides. Keep your elbows tucked and at a 90 degree angle. Your hands should be splayed to either side for jazz hands.









This should take about three beats, with the jazz hands posing at 3.

, Moving into the fourth beat, step your right foot to the right and cross the left foot behind it and bring your left hand up for jazz hands. This time, bend your head down to the right and grab your hat with your right hand.









You should end on the beat of four.

, Step your leg out to the left, then cross your right foot behind it. As you land, pull the hat off of your head and throw it to the side.









As you throw it, step back so that your feet are no longer crossed. Keep your legs bent for style. Step back to center and clap on the upbeat (4).

, With the right foot pointing dramatically to the right and either tapping or going up and down, smooth the left side of your head with your right hand. Your left hand should be at your neck, your elbow extended. Do this twice in four beats.









Smooth your hair starting at the top of your head and going around. Don’t cross you hand in front of your face.

, Extend your arm and leave your right leg bent and on its toe. Then step your legs together and turn 360 degrees to face your audience. This is where Michael Jackson grabs his microphone and begins singing.

Learn your group's talents on different movements, their strengths, and their weaknesses.,
Get an idea and find the right music.,
Get your formations straight.,
Choreograph the dance.",How to Choreograph a Modern Dance With Lots of People,"


To do this, take a day or so to have everyone learn a mini choreographed dance. Try to put a variety of things in there so you can take more notice to see who's good at what and what not.
Then, try to notice those who are confident being in the front, not the type of person or people that watch someone out of the corner of their eye. By doing this, you will learn who the core people you want to be in the front a lot of the time of the dance.
But, do make sure that the person or people that you are thinking about letting them be in front are talented with a lot of the movements executed almost perfectly, or in other words, have them down. The others who are not as confident, put them towards the back so if they don't remember a move or chunk of the dance, they can look at the people or person who know what they are doing.
Also, the person or people you put in the front, be sure to apply more pressure on them and have higher standards for them than the other people who are less confident or just beginners.;
, To find the right music, you need an idea, or just the opposite way around. If you like thinking of ideas before getting the music, that's fine.


Think of all the people's strengths you tested earlier and think about them as you get ideas.
If you are very advanced and have beginners in your class, you may want to try slowing down your mind and thinking of movements they could actually execute or do.
Once you have done your thinking, find the music. Modern dance doesn't always have to have a steady beat, but for beginners, you may want to have a steady beat. Modern dance, intense modern dance uses sort of foreign music and music that almost makes you imagine animals swinging on vines or things crawling. Music that is generally weird to people. Not all people, but most.
If your group does not like that type of exotic music, try choreographing a dance to a slow and fast tempo love song. You can fit A LOT of emotion in there. Also, remember that modern dance is one of the most emotional styles of dance so you must get your group of people used to TONS of expression. That would be another thing to test the group of people on in your mini choreography session.
If you like finding the music first, the most important thing to think about when choosing your music is to question yourself: Does this have a steady tempo? Or, Would this song give out a lot of emotion? Those are the main things you want to ask yourself, especially if you have a beginning group of people.

,


To do this, again, look back on all your people's strengths and weaknesses.
If there was only 1-2 people who were confident and had more of a advanced level in modern dance in the group, you may want to consider making a diamond formation. That type of formation is the most common; with one or two people at the peak. you also could use a trapezoid formation, a circle formation, or a 1-4 line formation depending on how many people you have teaching. You could use a diagonal formation or have many diagonals criss-crossing each other.
Also, be sure to make your formation move to different formations so there's more activity going on during your performance.

, As a suggestion, you should probably not have all the people doing the same thing at once all the time. You could make a cannon, which are groups of people all doing the same thing, but doing the movements at different times, or, you could have two or three groups doing something completely different but blends smoothly with all the other movements other people are doing.


Try to keep to exotic or African type movements with hip hop, ballet, and jazz combined with a tint of animal movements in your dance. After all, this is modern dance. If you're stuck on ideas, try looking at YouTube videos that have those type of movements described above. You can also take ballet movements and turn them into a more flowing or low to the ground movements.

Pick a piece that you love, that makes you feel emotional and that inspires you to want to dance yourself.Don’t worry about how long the piece is – you can always edit it to be longer or shorter using a program like GarageBand.
Take a long walk and listen to the music you have on your iPod or phone.
Make sure to pick a song that you like listening to. You’re going to be hearing it a lot.;
, Your audience, in this case, is who you will be teaching the dance to. Your audience is important because it will guide your choreographic choices, based on the audience's preference and skill levels.


For instance, you wouldn't teach the same dance to a group of experienced ballerinas that you would to an informal senior citizen's dance group.
Consider tailoring your dance to a specific group. If you're trying to create a new dance fad, you may want to go on the simple side, as most people's dance skills are amateur.

, Dances don’t just appear out of nowhere – they are born from a choreographer’s thoughts and points of view. There are many ways to go about getting inspired to create a dance. Here are a few options:Look at abstract designs and try to create movement that mimics what’s on the paper.
Read a book and let a line from the book inspire movement.
Try listening to the music you selected over and over and improvising a dance.
Pick a mood or emotion and let that inspire the dance.
Watch a movie and try to recreate a scene from the movie through movement.
Let a story, a relationship or an abstract concept serve as the inspiration for the piece.

, The age and skill level of your dancers will determine a great deal about the dance. After all, it’s almost impossible to teach a hip hop routine to a bunch of 5-year-olds who have only ever taken ballet.Think about how old the dancers are and how much dance experience they have.
Then pick a style of dance that the dancers will be able to confidently execute.
It’s okay to add in moves from different styles of dance.
Decide how many people will be performing in the dance. Is it going to be a solo or a duet? Will there be a whole line of people?
Decide if you yourself will be dancing or just choreographing.

, It’s much harder to choreograph an entire dance piece in one go. Instead, try breaking the song into verses or measures and creating sequences of movement for these smaller portions.If you have a distinct movement, try to bring it back at different intervals throughout the piece.
Make sure the movements you’re choreographing aren’t too hard for your dancers to perform.
Write your notes down so you don’t forget them!

, Instead of fruitlessly trying to come up with new movements, assign yourself a simple task, like walking the dog or eating breakfast. Then improvise movements based on that task.Once you have the movements for your simple task down, try drawing them out or speeding them up so they feel more like dance.
Rearrange the moves to create a new, more interesting sequence of movements.

, Dance, like all art, is subjective. Don’t get caught up in whether your dance looks like every other dance – just create a dance that showcases your point of view as a choreographer.It’s okay to be inspired by other dances, but don’t steal a dance move for move.
Don’t get upset if your dance doesn’t come out exactly how you envisioned – there’s no such thing as a perfect dance.

, To teach a dance to a group of people, you're going to need a decent amount of space so that people can move around. A studio space with a mirror is ideal, so that your students can see themselves in the mirror.If you can't get a studio, a gym is also a good space.
Another option is an outdoor tennis or basketball court.

, Chunking is a method in which you divide the dance into sections and give each section a name. This method is especially helpful when teaching longer dances to your dancers.This will also be helpful when you want to rerun sections. Instead of trying to describe the movement, you can say “Go to the ‘Windmill’ section.”
People remember better in small portions, so chunking will also help your dancers retain the choreography more easily.

, Just because you’ve sketched out a clear sequence of steps doesn’t mean that sequence can’t change in rehearsal. Allow your dancers to experiment with adding their own unique flair to the dance.However, even if your dancers aren't skilled enough to add new moves, you still need to be willing to adapt. For instance, if a transition proves to be too difficult for the group, you may need to modify it a bit to make it easier.


Watch as the dancers perform, and if they’re doing something you like, make a note of it and add it to your choreography.
Keep in mind, it’s easier to be flexible and change choreography if you’re working with a smaller group of dancers.
Always pay attention to how the dance is working. Sometimes, certain sequences just don't work in a group, or a group doesn't have the skill level to execute what you want.

, One way to help your dancers see what they're doing wrong is to use visual feedback. You can record dancers individually with a smartphone, and then play it back for them. Alternatively, you can break up in pairs and have each person record the other.One plus of using pairs is the partners can film individual sequences over and over again until each person gets it right.
If you film each student, try reviewing the video one-on-one with each student to encourage them and help them figure out how to do better.

, Some people have dance backgrounds while others are reluctant dancers at best. Be patient when teaching the choreography and don’t worry if some of your dancers are struggling with the moves.Tell the dancers to practice the choreography before the next rehearsal.
The more the dancers run the moves, the more comfortable they will get and the better the dance will look.

, Costumes are a great way to help set the mood and create the world that your dance will live in. Costumes can take a great deal of time to create and can be very expensive, so determine a monetary and time budget before beginning.If you don’t want to spend a great deal of time and money, ask your dancers to come dressed in their own clothes.
Make sure they wear clothing they can easily move in.
You can also buy costumes at a thrift shop or work with an artistic friend to make them from scratch.
If your dancers will be dancing in a big venue, make sure they wear stage makeup so their faces can be seen clearly.

, Dress rehearsal is the perfect time to run through the dance, in costume, with any props. It’s important to make the dress rehearsal mimic the show as closely as possible so the dancers will be prepared.If the dancers have never performed in front of an audience before, invite some friends to the dress rehearsal so the dancers can get used to it.
If possible, hold the dress rehearsal in the same space as the show.
Make sure to practice using the lights and the audio during the dress rehearsal.

, Whether you’re dancing in your dance or watching from the wings, the performance of your dance will be nerve-wracking. Channel your nervous energy into excitement and enjoy the show!Don’t worry if someone falls or makes a mistake. The show will go on.
Take pictures or ask someone else to. Creating a dance is a big accomplishment and you’ll want to remember it.

Mix it up!",How to Do the Country Two Step," The Country Two-Step, or Texas Two-Step, is a fairly simple dance to learn, but you should get familiar with the types of movements you'll be making. The dance itself is modeled on ""shuffle-step"" footwork with minimal upper body movement. Sites like YouTube offer plenty of instructional videos of people dancing the Country Two-Step. If you have a dance partner in mind, get them to watch the videos with you.
It may also help to read instructions about the steps, or look at pictures of the footwork.;
, Pick out a country song you like and give it a listen. Pay attention to the rhythm. Country music tends to feature a heavy, easy to find beat, usually in 4/4 time. You should be able to count 1, 2, 3, 4 or clap your hands with ease.

, Tap your foot to the beat. When your foot falls, that's a ""1."" When your foot rises, that's an ""and."" In music, this is known as ""subdivision.""


When you count, count as follows: 1, and, 2, and, 3, and...

, The basic two-step follows a ""quick, quick, slow, slow,"" pattern where the first two steps (the quicks) are twice as fast as the last two steps (the slows).


The first ""quick"" step will fall on a ""1.""
The second ""quick"" step will fall on an ""and.""
The first ""slow"" step will fall on ""2, and.""
The second ""slow step will fall on ""3, and."" , With the steps in mind, it's time to put them to music. While it is possible to practice to nearly any country song, Dale Watson released a song titled ""Quick, Quick, Slow, Slow"" specifically to help people learn the two-step.


Other popular two-Step tracks are ""If I Could Make a Living,"" by Clay Walker, and ""Jambalaya (On the Bayou),"" by Hank Williams, Sr.
As you listen to the music, think of the steps in relation to the beat.
It may be easier to start with a slower tempo song to help establish the beat.

, In dancing, ""frame"" refers to the shape you and your partner make. In order to dance well, you need to have a solid frame. For two-stepping, the most common frame is a traditional closed position.


If you're leading, place your right hand on your partner's left shoulder blade, and your left arm out to the side.
If you're following, place your left hand around your partner's right bicep. Grab their left hand with your right. Leave a few inches of space between you and your partner.

, Dancing the two-step with a partner is not far off from practicing alone. The only difference is the follower will be reversing the steps. As the leader moves forward, the follower will simply step backward.


The Country Two-Step always moves forward. Try not to sway your feet left or right.
Maintain good posture when dancing. Don't look at your feet when dancing. Confidence is key!

, A big part of two-stepping, and dancing in general, is being either a leader, or a follower. The leader guides the follower through the dance. If the leader steps forward with their left foot, the follower will step backward with theirs.


If you're leading, don't push your partner. If you're following, wait until the lead moves before you take a step.

, Right now, it might seem like you are just walking to the music. In order to transform these movements into a dance, keep it going across the floor. When dancing, progress counterclockwise around the dance floor.


If you're dancing at a club, remember to follow the line, or flow, of dance. Pay attention to the other dancers around you.

, The two-step takes a lot of cues from swing dancing. As such, all the spins, swings, and turns from swing dancing can be applied to two-stepping.To spin your partner, simply lift your left arm up and slightly to the right. The idea is to guide your partner under your arm.

, In Shadow dancing both dancers face the same direction with the follower standing in front of the lead.


Standing behind the follower, the lead places his or her right hand over the follower's stomach. The follower places his or her right hand over the lead's.
Both the lead and the follower hold their left arms out loosely to the side, holding hands. In this position, the footwork is largely the same for both dancers, with the follower mirroring, or ""shadowing,"" the lead, as the name suggests., Wrap is similar to shadow, except the dancers stand side-by-side. The lead passes his right arm behind the follower, holding their left hand at the follower's hip. The follower crosses their arms in front of them, placing their right hand in the lead's left. , Dancing Promenade style is similar to the traditional closed position, only instead of each dancer looking at each other, they are looking left.


To set up in the Promenade frame, set up in the traditional closed frame but pull your partner in close. You should almost be touching at the waist.
Turn your heads left and use your left arm as a guide across the dance floor., Feel free to experiment on the dance floor once you feel comfortable doing the basic two-step. Nearly any posture that can be applied to ballroom dancing, or swing dancing, can be applied to two-stepping. The most important thing is to have fun!

Choose a song that you like.,
Decide how many people you want to include in the dance.,
Pick a style of dance.Ballet is much different from hip-hop dancing, which is much different than the two-step.",How to Make Up a Dance1," Do you want the dance to work with a song? Dances don’t necessarily have to be to music, although they often are. Look for a song that has a good rhythm or beat.Consider using a song that has a build up and then a drop. Music like this lends itself to a beat. Soft acoustic music might be harder to dance to.;
, If you’re making the dance with a friend, then you should probably include them in the creative process. If you want to have the dance work for a big group, that decision will play into the different moves you will use and the space you will need.


Understand that dancing with large groups of people can be much harder than dancing alone. However, it will be also be a lot of fun and the pressure won’t be entirely on you. Be prepared to organize constantly if you want to dance with a large group.

, Consider what style of dance works with the music you want to choose. If you plan to have no music that will influence the type of dance that you do too.If you have no music you’ll probably want to choose a dance that is more interpretive, rather than a standard hip hop dance.

Put the Maypole together.,
Divide the dancers into two groups.,
Develop a pattern.",How to Do a Maypole Dance," Unless you have access to a Maypole that has already been made for the purpose, you will need to make your own. Find a tall pole and attach ribbons or strong streamers at the top of the pole. These ribbons will need to be an even number, the same number of ribbons as there are dancers.;
, For example, you might have them count off one, two, one, two, one, two around the circle, or A, B, A, B, etc. The A's can go clockwise and the B's go counterclockwise. The dancers go alternately right and left of the dancers going in the opposite direction.

, The pattern the dancers should keep in mind is over, under, over, under, over, under etc.


On the count of ""over"", the dancer raises his ribbon slightly so the dancer coming in the opposite direction can duck under his ribbon.
On the count of ""under"" the dancer ducks under the ribbon of the dancer coming in the opposite direction.

"
"
Watch videos of dancers you admire.,
Use your own body and skills for inspiration.,
Free dance.You need to feel the movement to be inspired.,
Take dance lessons.",How to Make Up a Dance2," Watch music videos of dancers who perform in the same genre as the song you chose. This will help you start to get an idea of what your dance should look like. It’s okay to take a few moves from the videos here and there, but don’t copy it directly. Rather, pay attention to the way that they move their body and how you might like to emulate that style.For example, if you are planning to make up a hip hop and R&B dance pay close attention to how the artist you are watching uses their hips. Hips can help keep the rhythm and add a lot of spice to a dance.
Search for similar dances in the style you chose. Try searching for famous dances in the genre that you want to dance in.

, For example, if you already know that you can do cartwheels very well then you should consider incorporating that move into your dance. If you have great balance and coordination, maybe balletic moves are a better idea to incorporate. Consider the ways in which you are comfortable moving your body and cater your dance that way.

, Sometimes the best dance moves are the ones that will come most naturally to you. If you try to be too robotic by mimicking others the dance won’t look as good. Just move with the music and do what comes naturally. Start by swaying around a little bit and moving your arms and legs. If you’re alone you have nothing to be embarrassed about., If you’re really struggling to dance or you just feel awkward or uncomfortable, consider taking dance lessons. There are dance lessons for almost every genre of dance you can think of. You’ll be with a group of other beginners and you might find people who are willing to dance with you. You’ll learn a lot, become more comfortable, and find new moves that you can incorporate into your dance."
"
Start to pair moves together.,
Incorporate common moves.,
Match your moves to different sections of the song.,
Begin blocking your dance.,
Write out your routine.It’s perfectly fine to use your own shorthand, since you’re going to be the only one explaining the routine to other people anyways.,
Convey a mood with your dance.",How to Make Up a Dance3," Choose moves that flow easily into one another. Use the notes that you have compiled while watching dances in your genre and by free dancing.For example, if you're doing a dance that requires you to lean forward and shake your hips, you should transition into another move that requires you to shake your hips. Maybe instead of leaning forward you lean all the way backward. Those two moves have now been paired together and can be incorporated into your dance.

, Common dance moves like the Twist for rock and roll music or the the two step and arm wave for hip hop can help you start to figure out what kind of dance you want to move.


The twist involves standing with your feet shoulder length apart and then proceeding to twist your hips while you shift your weight from one foot to another. Hold your arms away from your body. It's a great starting point for older rock and roll songs.
If you're trying to make up a hip hop dance, two step is a great options. The two step is easy, you bend over slightly with one foot forward and one foot back. You take one step forward from a low position and rock up, then step back and rock back. It's basically an exaggerated walking in place motion.
The arm wave is another good hip hop dance move. To do the arm wave you put both your arms out straight to the side, then lift your hand at the wrist while you keep the rest of your shoulders and arms level. Then let your hand drop and lift just your wrist. As you do this you want your fingertips to be roughly in the same line as your shoulder. When you lift your elbow it raises while your hand shoulder stay down. After this you move to your other shoulder - as the shoulder drops the elbow comes up, then your other wrist comes up, followed by your other hand. It might be easier to visualize rolling a ball from one hand to another. You do the same motion.

, Dividing the song into sections will help you remember your dance moves, but it will also help you come up with a better idea for what sort of dance you should be doing at each point of the song.


For example, if the song starts slow your dance should reflect that. Once the song starts to pick up speed, you could designate that as a different section and dance differently during that period of time.

, If you already know where you’re going to be dancing when you perform, consider placing down pieces of tape that designate the areas you need to be at certain points in your dance. Blocking is a word used in theater that indicates the location the actor is supposed to be on the stage. If you are dancing with many different people you can use different colors of tape for each person.


Take your event and audience into consideration when you’re blocking your dance.

, Just make sure that you are organized and clear enough that you are able to remember what means what.


Writing out your routine will help you make it clearer in your mind and you’ll also start to notice things like inconsistencies in the dance or if there are parts with too much repetition.

, Make sure your dance matches your music and the mood you want to convey. Slower dances may be more emotional and introspective, whereas if you are moving your hips quickly and moving around with faster motions you might bring a higher energy to the dance. Consider what you want to accomplish with your dance.

"
"
Schedule a time to practice.,
Don’t be afraid to revise your routine.As you practice you might find that you’ll start to come up with little tweaks to the routine that you feel make it more interesting.,
Practice until you’re comfortable with your dance.Once you feel like you can do the dance all the way through by heart and get it right every time, keep practicing.",How to Make Up a Dance4," This is particularly important if you’re practicing with a team, but it’s also good to schedule time to practice if you’re practicing alone. This will make you more likely to stick to your routine. Try to practice the dance in sections.

, This will happen naturally as you are inspired day by day.


If you’re practicing with a group you shouldn’t make dramatic changes, but it’s perfectly fine to incorporate some of these tweaks.

, Then you’ll be ready to perform! Once you’ve completely embedded the dance into your muscle memory you’ll be much more confident performing in front of people. Good luck.

Get in an alluring state of mind.,
Sway like the women.,
Pursue the woman if you’re a man.",How to Dance Traditional Cumbia Colombiana1," It’s believed that the cumbia was originally a folkloric dance, in which African slaves imitated the Spanish. They did this, in part, through dressing in long skirts like the slave owners. As these two groups began to culturally and racially mix with indigenous Colombians, the cumbia became a dance of courtship and love. As such, the traditional dance almost always included pairs of men and women dancing with one another. However, they generally didn’t touch much, if at all.This was set to a new style of music, cumbia, using the rhythm of drums (the African influence) and the melody of flutes (the native Colombians).;
, In its oldest and most traditional form, you hold a burning candle and take short, sliding or dragging steps to mimic the limited foot movement imposed by shackles on slaves’ ankles. You dance slowly along with other women in a counterclockwise circle. As you continue moving in a circle, sway your body back and forth while waving your skirt in a figure-8 motion. At times of your choosing, and without warning to your partner, approach him and spin, letting the candle pass before his face before retreating to your place in the circle.Today, candles aren’t used much. Instead, women hold both sides of the skirt as they wave it or use one hand to wave the skirt while the other is raised in an open arc.
You can dress in the original style or the more flamboyant one of today. If the former, wear a long and colorful skirt (a bolero) and a short-sleeved white shirt. Go either barefoot or in sandals, and wear your hair back.Or you can dress as many do today in long, colorful dresses. The skirt of the dress is often made of layers and ruffles and adorned with sequins. Wearing flower headdresses or a large flower tucked behind your ear is common. Large earrings and a face full of makeup are also the norm. You can go barefoot or in sandals., Much of the man’s dance involves trying to lure the woman to him. His steps and movements are also faster than hers. Dance behind and around the woman, and take your hat on and off your head with one hand while holding the other behind your back. This gesture is intended to entice the woman toward you. When she approaches and spins, you can “crown” her with your hat before also spinning around her and then retreating. In some scenarios, the man holds a red handkerchief, bends low and fans the woman’s feet with it.Wear white pants and a white shirt; a hat or sombrero; and a large, colorful (often red) handkerchief tied around your neck. You can go barefoot or in sandals."

Decide what kind of fight you want it to be.,
Make sure that the person you cast, if not having had training in that particular martial art, can at least pull off some of the moves.,
While shooting, do not make the fight continuous.,
Make sure you have some funky moves in your fight.,
Speed or slow down the camera shot to give a feel to a particular move.,
Finally make sure you film the fight from all angles possible.",How to Choreograph a Fight Scene," It can either be a classic kung fu fight like the Bruce Lee or Matrix movies or Krav Maga like Bourne Ultimatum or Boxing like Rocky.;
, If you are shooting a kung fu fight, make sure the person can pull off high kicks and knows at least a couple of takedowns, etc. If he doesn't, get someone who has trained in the art to teach him

, Create pauses in the fight after every few seconds and register the fighters expressions by zooming into his face etc.Get your fighter to make funny wah wah or ""hiyah"" sounds . It adds to the feel of the fight.

, Only boxing punches in a fight is really boring.Include the high kicks frequently,the takedown now and then.Do not just show one person getting beaten up. Include blocks,parries,rolls and weapons if possible

, You can show cool kicks in slow motion or speed up Punches to make it look like Bruce Lee

, Choose a suitable setting and make sure the fight is performed throughout the setting for eg if you choose to include a staircase on the setting or a swimming pool. Make part of the fight take place on the staircase or in the water

Learn the step pattern.,
Start with your feet together.,
Step back with your right foot.,
Step in place with your left foot.,
Bring your right foot forward to neutral.,
Step back with your left foot.,
Bring your left foot forward to neutral.",How to Dance Traditional Cumbia Colombiana2," Over time, the step sequence changed and became more formalized. Instead of short, sliding steps, they became a simple 4-count, “two-step” forward and backward motion. It’s not necessary to use this pattern if dancing in the original style. However, it’s important to know it as most people dance the cumbia this way today.


This appears to be largely due to the addition of other musical instruments to the cumbia, such as the guitar, accordion, tambora (a large, two-sided drum), maraca, conga (a Cuban hand drum), horns and the piano., Stand with your feet close together, which is the neutral position. You can hold your skirt with one or both hands and wave it. Or you can bend both arms at the elbows and roll them inward in circles close to your body – in the space between your shoulders and hips.


Women can tilt their wrists up for a feminine flair., As you step back, pivot your left foot so that your right curls slightly behind your left and a little to the side. It should be about a 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) behind your left.

, As you’re doing the dance, be enthusiastic and smile flirtatiously.

, Lift your heel and step forward on your toes to the neutral position.


Pause for a beat to switch your weight from left to right.

, Do this as you did with your right foot, but now pivoting your right instead.

, Pause when your left foot comes to the neutral position. Then repeat the basic moves, starting with your left foot.


Move your hips and torso from side to side to the rhythm as you do the steps.
Mouth or count to yourself for each beat: 1 when your right foot goes back, 2 when your left steps in place, 3 when your right moves forward, and 4 when it comes to neutral.
When you repeat and move your left foot back first, start counting from 5-8."
"
Stand facing your partner.,
Step backward at the same time.,
Come back together with your partner.,
Pause and repeat in the opposite direction.",How to Dance Traditional Cumbia Colombiana3," Stand facing one another about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart and gently hold hands.


You can also stand beside your partner shoulder-to-shoulder and do the basic steps in tandem - either while holding one another’s waists and extending your free arms or without touching.And you can integrate the steps into the original style by simply replacing them with the sliding step.

, The leader will step back on his/her right foot as the follower steps back on his/her left. While doing this, let go of your partner’s hand and extend your free arm.


The leader will release and extend his or her right arm, and the follower his or her left.
This creates an open area as both partners step back and come shoulder-to-shoulder.
You also can wrap your arm around your partner’s waist as you meet shoulder-to-shoulder and extend your free arm. Or you can combine the two.

, Each partner will now take the same foot and step back to neutral so they are face-to-face.


Bring your free arm toward your partner while doing this, and hold hands again.
Both partners should move their hips from side to side as they dance.

, Pause briefly when you are again face-to-face. Then step back on your other foot first (the leader’s left and the partner’s right) and repeat.


Continue switching from side to side.
The count will be 1 when you both step back, 2 when you place your opposite foot, 3 when your bring your other foot forward, 4 when you come back together, 5 when you move your other foot back, 6 when you place your opposite foot, 7 when you bring your foot forward, and 8 when you come back together."
"
Step backward together.,
Release hands.,
Begin the turn.,
Finish the turn.",How to Dance Traditional Cumbia Colombiana4," As with the basic partner dance, the leader steps back on his or her right foot while the follower steps back on his or her left.


Continue holding hands as you step back.

, The leader lets go of the follower’s right hand and uses his or her left hand to guide the turn.

, The leader gently pulls the follower forward on his or her right foot. The follower plants his or her right foot, which he or she will turn on.


Almost simultaneously the leader also lifts the follower’s right hand and arm to begin the turn.

, As the leader turns the follower, he or she steps forward and to the side on his or her left foot and completes the turn, bringing them to neutral.


The count is 1 when they both step back, 2 when the follower steps forward and the turn begins, 3 when the leader steps forward and to the side to complete the turn, and 4 when they come back together to neutral."

Synchronize your moves.",How to Dabke," You can dance dabke to any music, as long as it has a consistent recognizable rhythm. Songs with a faster pace work best for this high-energy dance.


Traditional dabke music is performed live using a combination of instruments that usually include hand drums, woodwinds, and the oud. The band may play well-known songs or improvise, sometimes blending the two together. A vocalist also typically performs, singing songs that tell a story or are in some way significant to the event being held.
Modern dabke can be done to either live music or a recording. Newer dabke music often blends traditional instruments with electronic beats. Some popular dabke artists make their music entirely digitally.Vocalists are less common in modern dabke music, with many popular songs having only a small singing part with some completely instrumental.Even just a large group clapping can be danced to. Clapping can also be used in addition to music to help dancers keep rhythm and as a way for non-dancers to join in.;
, Stand up straight, holding your neighbors' hands. Keep your feet spaced slightly apart with your left foot slightly in front. Try to line your feet up in parallel with your partners'., Swing your left foot towards your right side. Cross over your right foot with your left to take a step. At this point your legs should now be crossed., Step further to the right with your right foot. Uncross your legs by moving your right foot one step to the right. You should now be standing a few feet from where you were at the beginning of the dance but in the exact same position., Repeat the steps you just took. Cross your left leg in front of your right. Follow up by taking a step to the right. This whole sequence is called a ""cross-over""and is the basic step of the dabke. Cross-overs may be done many times between other moves. Over the course of the dance, the chain may reverse directions. To accomplish this, simply switch your sides so that your right foot faces towards the front and crosses over your left leg.

, Swing your foot into a ""low kick."" Your leg should be straight and form a roughly 45 degree angle to your right leg and the rest of your body. Keep your toes facing either forward or angled up rather than pointing towards the ground., Take your leg from a ""low kick"" to a ""raise."" Simply bend your knee and bring your thigh up as high as you can get it. Your left leg should now be at a nearly 90 degree angle compared to the rest of your body. Your knee should point slightly downward.

, Bring your left foot back flat on the ground by straightening your leg and focusing your weight forward slightly. After you stomp down, you should once again be in your starting position.


As dabke literally means ""to stomp,""this step is often considered the most important part of the dance., Dabke is a very energetic, fast-paced dance. You and your partners should perform these steps as quickly as the music demands. Cross-overs, kicks, and stomps should each be done as fluidly as possible without a major pause in movement.


While dabke is generally made up of these two main steps, many dancers incorporate a variety of different types of jumps and footwork.

, In most styles of dabke, the chain of dancers is led by one person as its ""raas"" (meaning ""head"") or lawweeh (meaning ""waver""). He or she decides what moves to do and where the chain will go. Some dabke leaders may position themselves at the end of the chain itself,while others dance in an unlinked separate position between the chain and an audience.


Watch your lead and try to mimic him or her while in sync with the other dancers.
Because of their relatively free position, leads may perform certain moves, such as spins or flips, that are impossible for linked dancers to do. The other dancers are not generally expected to repeat these.

, Once you've practiced enough and grown confident in your dabke skills, you may ask to take a turn as the leader. Immerse yourself in the music. As the song goes on, make decisions on what moves will look the best together and feel most natural to the dancers you are leading.

, The occasional synchronized jump or kick adds variation to the dabke. Use them to punctuate every few step cycles. Kick your legs forward. Hop backwards, forwards, or to the side.

, If you aren't dancing in a circle, switching directions will be necessary every time you reach the end of the dance floor. However, you may choose to switch directions more often or turn the line instead. Try to make these changes regularly after a certain time or number of step cycles.

, Splitting a long dabke chain into much smaller ones for a time is another popular move, especially for choreographed dabke teams. These smaller lines can then dance against each other to create beautiful patterns.


Splitting may also be done to spotlight solo dancers.Two almost opposite moves are to move the chain inward to form a semicircle or join the ends for a temporary complete circle.

, You will need at least three people for dabke, but the dance works best with five or more. There is no limit to how many people can join in on a single dabke dance. In fact, the world record for the biggest dabke dance consisted of 5,050 dancers.Get as many people to dabke as you have room for.


To gather a dabke group, ask family members and friends if they would like to start one.
Some events may have a specific time to dabke planned. If you're curious about when it starts, what kind of music will be playing, or who can join in, try asking the host.
You could also put together a dabke team beforehand and ask to perform at the event.

, Usually someone will volunteer to lead, but if you know someone is particularly talented, you can try asking him or her personally. Ultimately, anyone who knows the basics of dabke can lead, no matter the person's age, gender, or skill-level., An important aspect of dabke is that it symbolizes harmony and togetherness. To do this, the dancers physically link themselves together.Dancers may hold hands, place arms over each other's shoulders, or switch between the two over the course of the dance.
A dabke chain can be a straight line,a semicircle,or lack a defined shape altogether.

, Try to make sure that you and the other dancers are exactly in sync with each other. The more people who stay in perfect time, the more impressive your dabke will look. In addition to looking great, the coordinated moves further drive home the importance of community in dabke.

Release.",How to Dance Corridos," Start the dance by assuming standard ballroom position. The man's back should face the center of the dance floor, and the woman should face both the man and the dance floor.Note that couples dancing corridos formally will form a double circle around the ballroom and move counter-clockwise.
The man and woman should face each other with their bodies slightly touch. The right half of the man's front should come in contact with the right half of the woman's front, starting at the upper thighs and extending up through the middle of the torso.The man should take the woman's right hand with his left. The two palms should clasp, and the fingers and thumbs of the man's hand should close around the woman's hand.
The man should place his right hand on the woman's back, right at the base of the shoulder blade. This hand should be loosely cupped, with the fingers and thumb together.
The woman should keep her left hand and left forearm on the man's right arm.;
, During the first five measures, the man should take ten step-closes to the right, moving clockwise. The woman will follow with ten simultaneous step-closes to the left.


These first five measures take place during the introduction of the song.
To perform a step-close:

The man steps on his right foot during the first count.
He closes his feet, then steps his left foot beside the right during the second count.



, For measures 6 through 13, the man will make eight grapevine steps to the left, moving counter-clockwise, and the woman will match his steps by moving to the right.


To perform a grapevine step:

The man crosses his right foot in front of the left, stepping down on it during the first count.
He steps sideways and to the left with his left foot during the second count.
During the third count, he crosses his right foot behind his left and steps down on it.
For the final and fourth count, he steps sidewards to the left using his left foot.



, The man should stamp his left foot for a count of two, then swiftly close his feet and stamp the right foot next to the left on the third count of the measure. By the fourth count, the right foot should be freed again for movement.


The woman will also stamp her feet, but her movements should mirror the man's. As a result, she will stamp her right foot on a two count, stamp her left next to her right on the third count, then free her left foot.

, For measures 14 and 15, the man makes four step-closes to the right, moving clockwise again. The woman makes four step-closes to the left.


This portion of the dance usually takes place during a brief musical interlude of the song.

, This portion of the dance is a little complex and involves a series of slides or shuffles. As usual, the woman's movements should mirror the man's; when he moves right, she moves left, and vice versa.


During measure 16, the man shuffles or slides four steps diagonally back and to the left. These steps start with his right foot, and alternate back and fourth between the right and left foot.
During measure 17, the man makes another four shuffles or slides, this time moving diagonally forward and to the left. Once more, he starts with his right foot and alternatives between the right and left.
The above two steps are repeated as a pattern three more times over six more measures.
During the last measure, the man stamps twice with his left foot for a count of two, quickly closes his feet together, and stamps his right foot next to the left by the third count. The right foot is once more freed by the fourth count.

, The first part of the dance is completed with the man taking another eight grapevine steps to the left, then performing the left-left-right-free stamping pattern that followed the initial set of grapevine steps earlier in the dance.


The woman continues to mirror these steps.

, As with the first part of the dance, the second part opens with ten step-closes. The man moves sideways to the right, and the woman moves to her left.


At the conclusion of these step-closes, the two partners release hands and break apart. The man clasps his hands behind his back and the woman uses hers to hold her skirt out to the side.
During this second part of the dance, the measure count resets. As such, these first step-closes for this portion are to measures one through five. Also note that each portion of the dance has the same number of measures (31).

, This part of the dance has its own complexities, as well, and must be broken down into substeps. The full movement set takes place over a series of two measures, though. The woman's moves mirror the man's moves, but the woman does not turn here even though the man does.


The man should cross his right foot in front of the left. Upon stepping back down onto the right foot, he must rock on it gently while simultaneously raising the left foot off the floor. This happens during the first count.
During the second count, the man must set his left foot down and rock on it in place.
On count three, the man closes his feet together and draws his right foot next to the left.
The above three steps are repeated for counts four, five, and six, but the movements are in reverse. In other words, his left foot crosses over the right, his right foot rocks in place, and his left foot draws back to the right.
Immediately after, the man must walk two steps forward (right foot, left foot) and turn to his left in a full circle. This takes place over the final two counts.

, The steps for the pas de basques and the final turn must be repeated three more times.


During the final measure, however, the man must stamp twice with his left foot, close his feet and stamp the right foot next to the left, then free his right foot again.

, Both partners must take four step-closes during the next four measures. The man moves to his right and the woman moves to her left.

, As with the first part of the dance, the couple enters into another soldado. This one follows the same steps and moves of the one performed during the first part of the dance.


The man makes four shuffling steps diagonally back and to the left, followed by four shuffling steps diagonally forward and to the left.
This pattern is repeated three more times. At the final measure, the standard left-left-right-free stamping pattern is performed.
At the conclusion of this soldado, the man must face his partner. Both partners must have their elbows bent. The man's right hand joins the woman's left hand at shoulder height, and the man's left hand must also be behind the woman's back, roughly at the base of her shoulder blade. The woman's right hand should continue to hold her skirt.

, For the remaining eight measures, both the man and the woman should perform grapevine steps. The man should move sidewards to the left, and the woman should move sideward right.


Every other measure, the woman should turn clockwise twice instead of performing grapevine steps. As she turns, she should move under their joined hands and take four walking steps. These steps start with the right foot and alternate between right and left.

, The final part of the dance starts in the same way the first part began. The man takes ten step-closes to the right, with the woman mirroring by moving to her left.


Note that this final part of the dance is almost identical to the first part. The only difference comes in during the final set of grapevine steps.

, The man must make eight grapevine steps to the left while the woman steps to the right. Do this eight times.


At the end of the last step, the man stamps on his left foot for a count of two, closes his feet, then stamps his right foot back to its place beside the left on the third count. For the fourth count, the right foot is freed again. The woman mirrors these steps with her opposite feet.

, Perform four step-closes to the right if you have the man's role. For the woman's role, perform four mirroring step-closes to the left.

, This soldado is exactly the same as it was during the first part of the dance. As usual, the woman mirrors the man's movements with her opposite foot.


The man should take four sliding steps diagonally back and to the left, starting with his right foot. Afterward, he should take four sliding steps diagonally forward and to the left, starting with his right foot again.
This movement should be repeated three more times.
During the final four-count, the man should stomp with his left foot twice on count. His right foot should should stomp next to the left on the third count. By the fourth count, his right foot should be freed up to move again.

, For the final measures of the dance, the partners should perform eight grapevine steps and conclude with another left-left-right-free foot stomping step.


Note that during this part of the dance, the couples should have their inside hands joined instead of being poised in the ballroom position. In other words, the man's right hand should join with the woman's left, while the woman holds up her skirt with her right hand and the man holds the back of the woman with his left hand.

, At the conclusion of the last set of steps, the song should end and the dance will be over. You and your partner can break apart and leave the dance floor.


At the end of the dance, both partners should thank each other.
Leave the floor as quickly and gracefully as possible at the conclusion of the dance. The man should lead the woman off the dance floor by offering her his arm and escorting her back to her seat."

Measure and mark height.,
Measure and mark distance for brackets.,
Drill in brackets.,
Pre-drill holes into the dowel.,
Attach dowel.",How to Make a Ballet Barre1," Use a tape measure and a pencil to mark the height you want your barre to be at on the wall. Make the mark for your first bracket, whether that will be in the middle of your barre or one end. Buy brackets meant either for stairway handrails or closet rods.


The ideal height of the barre is at the dancer’s waist level, or approximately 32-46” from the floor.Remember that the barre itself will sit on top of your brackets, so the actual height of the barre could be a few inches above your mark for where the bracket will go.
You may want to check first to find the placement of studs in your wall by using an electronic stud finder or finding studs based on wall outlets, nails in existing trim, or measuring in 16” increments from the wall.;
, Measure and mark where you want your brackets to attach to the wall. Use a level to make sure each one is at the same height. Adjust the number of brackets and their spacing according to the length of your barre:


4’ barre: 2 brackets spaced 32"" apart (8"" overhang)
6’ barre: 2 brackets spaced 48"" apart (12"" overhang)
8’ barre: 2 brackets spaced 64"" apart (16"" overhang)
10’ barre: 2 brackets spaced 80"" apart (20"" overhang)
14’ barre: 3 brackets, 1 centered with 64"" space on each side (20"" overhang)
16’ barre: 3 brackets, 1 centered with 80"" space on each side (16"" overhang), Use your power drill to attach brackets to the wall where you made pencil marks.


The number of screws will depend on the type and size of your brackets, but you will need enough to attach each one to the wall as well as another for each bracket to attach the dowel.

, Use the same distance between brackets that you marked on the wall to measure and mark where the brackets will attach to your wooden dowel. Then pre-drill holes into the dowel at these spots to make it easier to attach to the brackets.You can also mark where to pre-drill holes by laying the dowel on the brackets and marking where you will need to screw through them and into the dowel. Do this by looking up at the underside of the barre.

, Get underneath your barre and have a helper hold the dowel in place against the brackets so you can attach it with a screw through each bracket into the dowel.


You can also choose to attach the dowel to the brackets first, then mount the whole apparatus onto the wall. Just make sure you have helpers to hold the whole thing level and in place."

Get PVC pipe for the posts of the barre.,
Use PVC pipe or wood for the barre.,
Get joints for the pipe.,
Fit the pieces together.,
Attach foam to the feet (optional).",How to Make a Ballet Barre2," Get four pieces of pipe cut at 12” long for the base or “feet” of the posts. Decide on the desired height for your barre and get two pieces of pipe at that measurement. You may want it cut to a slightly shorter length, as overall height will be added by the joint pieces and feet.


Note that these pieces will make a single barre. If you want to make a double barre with two different heights, you will need to have four different sections of pipe and two extra cross joints to make the posts, which will total to your desired height.
The ideal height of the barre is at the dancer’s waist level, or approximately 32-46” from the floor., Get PVC pipe, wooden dowel, or closet rods cut to your desired length for the barre.


Some of the length will be absorbed by the joints used to assemble the barre, so you might want to add a few inches to your length before cutting.
Remember that you’ll need two lengths if you’re making a double barre at two different heights.

, Buy PVC joint pieces at the same diameter as your pipe. You will need six 90-degree angle elbow joints and two T-shaped (3-holed) cross joints.


Remember that if you’re making a double barre, you’ll need two extra cross joint pieces.

, Assemble the pieces of your barre. Connect two 12” pieces of pipe with a cross joint in the middle and two elbow pieces on the opposite ends. Place the piece for the height of your barre into the same cross piece to finish your first post. Assemble the second post in the same way.For a single bar, attach your PVC or wooden dowel piece to the top of your posts with elbow joints at each end.
For a double barre, attach the PVC or wooden dowel for your lower bar to your posts with cross pieces. Then place the second piece of post into the cross pieces on both sides. Add the top bar using two elbow joints.

, If you don’t want your barre to move around or scratch floors, buy craft foam or rubber to stick to the bottom of the feet, where each elbow joint touches the floor.


Cut pieces of foam in squares or circles that will fit the bottom of the elbow joints. It doesn’t matter if the foam overlaps the edges slightly, as it will offer more protection.
You can use PVC glue to affix the foam to the PVC, or buy self-adhesive foam sheets."

, To clean your shoes:

,


Do not spray the Windex directly onto the shoe. Instead, spray it onto the paper towel before rubbing the shoe with it.

, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser also works well. However, avoid using this method too often. The wetness will dry out the leather and can lead it to crack. It helps to only clean leather when there is an audition or performance.

,, Concentrate most on the areas of the shoe that are partially dirty or well worn.

, Leave in indirect warmth. Do not leave underneath a heater or in direct sunshine, as these are too drying.

Pull on your tights and the other parts of your costume.",How to Wear a Dance Belt," Most dance belts are similar in design to thong underwear. However, unlike thongs, dance belts have a thicker waistband so the flesh at the waist is not pinched in and the fabric is much sturdier. The middle back of the waistband is connected by a narrow piece of elasticized fabric that is strapped to the bottom of the front triangular panel which provides coverage of and support to the male genitalia. This narrow strip of fabric passes between the wearer's legs and fits in between the two buttocks, both for support and smooth appearance of the major gluteal muscles or bum cheeks. This is sometimes described as a T-back design. Some dance belts are made with a full seat rather than with a single T-strap.


The ""T-back"" or thong design is the most popular style of dance belt for several reasons. First, these belts don't betray underwear lines. Second, they don't cover your buttocks, so the glutes and hamstring muscles aren't restricted from extended to full strength. Third, because the thong style doesn't cover any muscles, it will not move around if you do rapid or vigorous movements; rather, the tension and tight fit of the belt and thong back stay in place. Lastly, if you're a serious performer, like a ballet dancer for example, you'll probably likely find yourself performing in white tights some day and you'll need to wear a thong style dance belt. In other words, get use to the belt now!Some manufacturers produce full seat or ""comfort"" compromise dance belts. These types are, however, less aesthetically pleasing as they often show underwear lines.Athletic supporters or jock straps also provide active males with support. Unlike the dance belt, these supporters have a pair of elasticized straps that meet the bottom of triangular fabric at the front. They pass between the legs and encircle the thighs just below and on each side of the buttocks. Again, these straps tend to be visible when wearing form-fitting tights, whereas dance belts avoid these lines by eliminating the jockstrap’s rear pair of straps and replacing them with a single thong Strap.;
, In general, the go-to and most popular color is flesh-colored, or 'nude' if you are non-dark skinned. They can be dyed darker colours to better match skin tones. The same dance belt can then be worn under black practice tights or white performance tights. In fact, a beige or flesh tone dance belt is more invisible under white tights than a white one.Dance belts are also produced in white and black.
The colour and the finish of the fabric used for making tights affects the appearance of the person wearing them. Light-colored tights, such as white, light grey, yellow, light blue, and taupe, can make the shape and contours of a man's genital bulge more distinctive than other darker colors because of the way bright stage lights create shadows and highlights so contrast. Darker tights, on the other hand, are generally less revealing as contours are more subdued with lower contrast, especially if more of a flat or matte rather than shiny finish, since shiny surfaces reflect more light striking raised surface contours.

, Dance belts are measured by waist size. Although most dance stores don't carry a very wide selection of men's dancewear, most should have a small section of men's tights and dance belts.


Even though dance belts are a specific product for men, dance clothing manufacturers have not standardized small - medium - large waist sizes.

, Most dance belts have two thin layers of stretchy fabric for the triangular panel, while some styles also incorporate a thin layer of triangular padded material. The front triangular support pouch can be constructed simply of a couple of layers of spandex or similar fabric. But you can also buy dance belts with a thin layer of light, non-bulky padding material incorporated in order to effect an even more smoothed, discreet bulge.

, When putting on a dance belt, take as much time as you need to get all your parts placed where you want and as comfortable as possible. Once the belt is on, nothing is supposed to move until you take it off., You'll probably want to have privacy for this.

, You will know it's facing forward because the ""V""-shaped cloth is in front of you, while the string is closest to your genitals.

, Do this as you would if putting on a pair of underpants, one leg at a time. The right leg should be in the right side of the belt and your left left should be in the left side.

, Pull it up to the height at which you wear your pants. Do not wear it low with the goal of keeping the thong part loose; this will only cause trouble down the line., Your penis is supposed to end up facing upwards, towards your abdomen. And you can quickly accomplish this by reaching your slightly curved palm of your hand down inside the dance belt to scoop up your scrotum upwards inside the supportive pouch, guiding all of the hanging parts to point towards 12 o'clock as you withdraw your hand while the fabric panel hugs and securely yet gently cradles and supports everything in place. Your two testicles will be up in front, not dangling between your legs, as they would unsupported once your body temperature rises due to all the physical exertion of dancing and the body's normal need to keep the testicular temperature from over heating. If the thong part feels overly tight, you can adjust by pulling it slightly lower, but there has to be some tension in order for there to be any support to the male anatomy. When properly positioned within the garment, the genitals are held closely and firmly to the lower torso in a raised orientation (in other words, pointing towards 12 o'clock). This is in contrast to most athletic supporters, which typically leave the genitalia hanging downwards so that if you jump there is bounce.
If anything feels uncomfortable, adjust it now. You won't be able to do this later especially if you are wearing n elaborate costume that covers your lower torso..
At first, you can expect to sense some unfamiliar pressure in your nether region, but if the device is of a proper fit you will quickly not notice you're wearing one after a few hours total of getting the hang of using it. You'll eventually come to appreciate the ability to jump, leap, and move without any concern for soreness or discomfort. , Adjust the height of the waist band so that it sits even with or slightly over the crest or top of your hip bones.. The thong strip should have a good bit of tension otherwise the device will not act as a good shock absorber when jumping (e.g. ballet changements and sautes).


The thong should never fit loosely underneath. It may feel more comfortable when worn loosely, but it will not provide effective, reliable support to the genitalia in that case and defeats the main purpose of wearing a dance support belt in the first place.

, Make sure you feel comfortable before leaving the change room. You want to feel confident, comfortable and well supported before you begin your dance, skate, or other activity. If your tights or whatever you're wearing has a seam running down the center middle of your lower torso, adjust it so the seam line is balanced evenly left and right side to side.


In performances, particularly ballet, readjusting the belt or costume is considered bad form when the audience can see this. This is why you should take care accordingly to get all of the adjustments right before you head out on stage."

Decide between canvas and leather.,
Figure out your shoe size in ballet slippers.,
Decide between full-sole and split-sole.,
Pick the right color for your needs.,
Get professionally fitted at a local dance store.,
Determine the price range.,
Seek suppliers in your area.,
Find providers online.,
Work with reputable sellers, especially when buying online.,
Understand the difference between pointe shoes and ballet slippers.,
Move around in shoes before making a purchase.",How to Choose Ballet Slippers," Ballet slippers generally come in two materials: canvas and leather. You can buy quality ballet slippers in either material, depending on what you're looking for specifically.Canvas slippers tend to absorb moisture better. They can also mold more to the shape of your feet. If you dance a lot, or plan to dance longterm, you may want to invest in canvas slippers. Also, some people may have moral opposition to leather as it's made from animals.
However, leather can sometimes be more durable. If you tend to dance aggressively, leather may be a better option. Leather can also provide more traction, so quick-paced dancing may be better suited to leather flats. Also, leather tends to provide more support, so it's reccomended when choosing ballet slippers for children.;
, Ballet slippers tend to run slightly smaller than regular shoe sizes. Your size for a ballet slipper may be one to two sizes smaller than your regular shoe size. For example, if you're normally a size 6, your ballet size may be size 3 1/2 to 4. Sizes vary by company. If you're looking to buy ballet shoes from a particular manufacturer, you should see if their company provides a size conversion chart online.Figuring out your size can give you a rough range of what to look for in ballet slippers. You should always try to try ballet slippers on before making a purchase.
For some companies, children's sizes do not change between regular shoes and ballet slippers. If you are choosing a ballet slipper for a child, converting shoe sizes may not be necessary.

, Ballet slippers come in two types: full-sole and split-sole. With full-soles, the sole runs through the length of the foot. With split-soles, there is half a sole on the heel of the foot and half a sole on the ball of the foot.For children or inexperienced dancers, full-soles are a good idea. They help with balance and also provide more support and cushioning to the foot.If you've been dancing for awhile, you may be able to get by with a split sole. For more advanced dancers, split soles allow you more flexibility. It may be easier to arch and maneuver your foot with a split sole shoe, which may help with more advanced dance moves., Color is somewhat subjective when it comes to ballet slippers. Traditionally, it's pink for women and black for men. If you're planning to dance professionally, in a traditional form, you may want to follow this convention. However, ballet slippers come in a variety of colors. If you're just dancing for fun, do not worry about tradition. Select a ballet shoe in a color you like., Online conversion charts can help you get a sense of your size. However, it's a good idea to get fitted at a professional dance store if you've never purchased shoes before. If your purchasing slippers for a child, you should get your child professional fitted as well. You should also get professionally fitted if you're switching styles or brands of ballet slippers.You or your child will stand on a platform or flat surface in the store. A worker will measure your feet and then bring you a range of sizes to try on.
Properly fitted shoes should feel snug, without being too tight. You will likely be asked to walk around some to get a sense of how well the shoe fits.
Your size may change depending on the brand and type of shoe you are buying. If you're buying ballet slippers for a child, the child's size will change as he or she grows.

, Ballet slippers are fairly inexpensive, and are less pricey than other ballet shoes like pointe shoes. You can generally find a pair of ballet slippers between $20 and $30. If you're going with a bigger, better known company, prices may be slightly higher, but you should generally be able to get slippers within this price range. You should be wary of suppliers selling slippers well below the typical price range. These shoes may not be high quality.With children, ballet slippers will need to be replaced frequently. However, you should still look for shoes in the regular price range. Cheaper shoes may save money short term, but improper footwear can hamper your child's learning., It's a very good idea to try on ballet shoes, walk around, and move some before purchase.Therefore, you should look into local suppliers first. Ideally, you should purchase ballet shoes in store from a local business.


Professional dance stores should sell ballet shoes. If you live in a metropolitan area, there is probably a dance store in your area. You can look online, or in the yellow pages. If you're in a smaller area, you may still be able to find a professional dance store, especially if ballet classes are taught in your area.
Ask around. If you're taking a ballet class, ask your teacher to point you in the direction of shoe suppliers. You can also talk to your fellow dancers.

, You may not always be able to find ballet shoes from a local source. If you do not live close to a local supplier, you can buy ballet shoes online from a wide variety of suppliers.


You may be able to find online buyers by asking other dancers. This is probably your best option, as members of the dance community will have feedback and insight regarding a company's reputation.
You can purchase ballet slippers from large retail sites, like Amazon, but it may be best to go to a supplier's website directly. You can look at size charts to determine the right size shoe for you, and there may be a number to call if you have any questions.
Check return policies when working with online companies. It's a good idea to make sure you're able to return any shoes you buy online. As you'll be dancing in ballet slippers, you want to make sure they're comfortable. If they don't fit upon arrival, you need to be able to return them.

, You want to make sure any sellers you work with are reputable. When working with a local company, it's slightly easier to determine reputation. You can ask other dancers, and browse Yelp reviews. You can also get a feel for a company upon visiting and interacting with the staff. When buying online, take extra precaution.Online companies may have Yelp pages as well, which you can browse prior to purchase. You can also see if an online company allows user to leave reviews. One or two bad reviews among many good ones may just be one person's experience. However, an onslaught of negative reviews is probably a bad sign.
You should also look for basic signs that an online company is legitimate. The site should not be overrun by pop-up ads. There should be a physical address and phone number. Prices should not be unbelievably low. There should also generally be a privacy statement and a return policy., Pointe shoes are probably more heavily associated with ballet than ballet slippers. These are shoes designed to help advanced dancers stand on pointe, which means on the tips of their toes. Ballet slippers, on the other hand, are lightweight shoes often used in dancing and practice. Pointe shoes have much stricter rules regarding sizing and style. If you're looking for pointe shoes, talk to a professional dancer or dance instructor about how to begin your search., The best way to determine if a ballet slipper works for you is to dance. When trying on shoes in a store, or trying on a pair you bought online, move in the shoes. Do a few basic dance moves. If you can comfortably feel the balls of your feet, and point your toes without feeling a pinch, the slippers are probably the right size and shape for you."

When you are moving around, see if the leotard pulls in the wrong places, or rides up your backside uncomfortably or sags. Also see if the straps move around or dig in, and if your shoulders and neck are comfortable.The perfect leotard will stretch comfortably and have some give when you move around, but it will also stay in place and will not be too loose.

, Your ballet slipper should not be too small or too big; it should fit snugly. You should also have enough room to wiggle your toes in the slipper.If you are purchasing slippers for your child, try to avoid buying slippers that are a half or a full size bigger. Slippers that are too big can cause ballerinas to trip or prevent them from performing their moves correctly.

, Leather slippers are more durable and will last longer than canvas slippers. On the other hand, canvas slippers are more flexible and may be more ideal for a beginner. They are also easier to clean. Additionally, canvas slippers work better on vinyl floors while leather works better on wooden floors.Female students are usually required to wear pink slippers while male students are usually required to wear black or white.
Satin ballet slippers are only worn during recitals and performances.

, Because a full sole provides more support, it is recommended that beginners purchase these. On the other hand, split sole slippers are more flexible and allow the student and teacher to see the arch of the foot. Make sure to check your ballet school’s guidelines before making a decision.

, If you buy slippers with unattached elastics (straps), then you will have to sew them on. Therefore, it is recommended that beginners purchase slippers with pre-attached elastics.Additionally, slippers can either have one strap or two crisscrossed straps. Try on both to see which style secures your foot better.

, There are a variety of styles and colors to pick from. You can choose from convertible, footed, seamed, stirrup, footless, or body tights. Schools usually require beginners to wear footed tights, so make sure to check your school’s guidelines before purchasing them.Female students are usually required to wear pink tights while male students are usually required to wear black.

, Female students (and perhaps male students who have long hair) are usually required to wear their hair in a “ballet bun.” To create the proper ballet bun, you will need bobby pins, hair bands, and a hair net. Keep extra hair accessories in your ballet bag in case something breaks or falls out.Some schools require their students to have a specific type of hair net (either knit, black fishnet, or thin), or they may have rules regarding the color of bobby pins and hair bands. Make sure to check the guidelines before purchasing your hair accessories.
Typically, the only requirements for male students are to have their hair groomed and out of their face.

, Knit leg warmers, sweat pants, booties, sweat shirts, top wraps and body wraps are all categorized as warmups. These help keep your muscles warm while you are stretching and warming up. Schools usually do not care what kind of warmups you use. However, make sure to check the guidelines before purchasing your warmups., Ballet bags are great for keeping your ballet attire organized. You can either use an athletic bag, backpack, or another type of bag of your choice. Just make sure your bag can hold all of your attire. It is recommended that you buy a medium to large sized bag to ensure that everything fits."

Get your primary dance teacher's permission before buying pointe shoes.,
Once you have your teacher's permission, contact local dance shops and ask about buying pointe shoes.,
Set up an appointment or go to the shop, depending on their policy (note: if you go to the shop without setting up an appointment, try to time it at a time when you know the owner or someone highly trained in fitting will be there).

,
Wear ballet tights so you know how the shoes will fit.

,
Pick out pads first; you may have to adjust these later, but the fitter should be able to help you pick out the type that is best for your feet.,
Once the fitter has determined your size, they will give you several shoes to put on.,
When you go up in the shoes, see if you feel over on the box.,
Try on as many pairs as necessary, in as many styles and strengths as you feel necessary.,
Narrow your choices down to a few pairs and try them on in succession, picking the pair that feels the best both on flat and on pointe.

,
Get your shoes checked by your teacher to make sure you have been fitted correctly before sewing them.",How to Buy Your First Pair of Pointe Shoes," This is very important because pointe work can be severely dangerous and damaging if you are not ready, so make sure. Your dance teacher will assess whether you are ready; pointe-work requires lots of physical and mental strength, particularly in the ankles. You will also need very good balance.;
, Make sure they know that this is your first pair. The shop should be professional and have experience in fitting pointe shoes, because it is essential that they are right for your feet. They will most likely be very expensive, but if you know your size, you can buy your next pair online for less.

,,, There are lots of different types of pads for supporting and cushioning your foot, so pick the one that feels the most comfortable – every dancer is different and at home you may want to try different techniques and ways of putting the pads in, to see what’s best for you.

, Take your time and pay attention to how they feel (i.e.- do they feel tight/loose etc. in the box/shank etc.) and communicate this to the sales person.

, Then see if you look over on the box. (The box is the flat part on the toe of the shoe that you stand up on)

, The fitter is being paid to do this, so don't feel bad!

,, Warning: Many stores do not allow you to return pointe shoes, so make sure that you have a trusted fitter with you there

Pour the resin into a shallow tray big enough for your foot and shoe to fit into.,
Put your socks on, put your shoes on, and lace and tie them as though you are going to dance in them.

",How to Resin Irish Dance Shoes1," They make special ""boxes"" for this purpose, but you could also just use a paint tray, an aluminum roasting pan or something similar. Paper plates also work well because they're cheap, and you can pour what you need onto them and then throw them away so you have a fresh on every time.;
,"
"
Remember that you will be high on your toes for much of your time dancing, so your heels really don't matter.

,
Pick your foot up, and press the ball and toes down in the resin.,
Do the same with your other foot.

",How to Resin Irish Dance Shoes2,", Wiggle it around.


If you have suede sole ghillies, you will need more resin then if you have the thick leather-y soles. Keep in mind that although a little resin on the leather is nothing to worry about, you don't need a lot.

Put them on.,
Add on any buckles or elastics you may be wearing.

Test it out to make sure it's enough.",How to Resin Irish Dance Shoes3," Get a good, solid knot.

,, Once again, start with the ball. This is literally the tip area.

,


Try not to get too much resin on the suede part in between.

, If you're not going on toe in your dance, you can be a little more lenient, but it's still a good idea to get a little on there for your drills. It also adds stability to your trebles/drillies/shuffles and/or rallies.

, Add more if it will make you more comfortable. The last thing you want is to slip!

Get your teacher's approval.,
Find a feis you want to compete in.,

Fill in your age as of January 1st of the current year.

,
Fill in your date of birth, and the age you currently are.

Make sure you know where you're going.

",How to Register for a Feis (Irish Step Competition)," Make sure they think you're ready enough so that you don't crash and burn in front of 50+ people.;
, There are many, many feisanna in the spring.

, Usually these will be available somewhere in your dance studio. Make sure you have a copy of the official form, because some feisanna require that you submit an actual entry form and ignore index cards or paper. Better safe than sorry. On the flip side, some feisanna will ask that you use an index card. It will probably say, ""Entries to be submitted on a 3x5 card."" This means a standard index card. The information sheet will then give you a list of things to write down (i.e. 1. Name, 2. Age, and so on). Always number the card 1 through 10 and write each tidbit of information down next to the number designated on the form.


If you read about the feis online, there will usually be a link that takes you to the syllabus and entry form.
Some schools will mail you your number if you enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope big enough for however big of a card they say. This is optional, because all feiseanna will give you your number when you get there if you don't have it already.
Sometimes schools will post the list of competitors and their numbers, schools, levels, etc. on their website once they have received all the entries. If such is the case, you can look, but don't write your number on your own index card, because the card they give you will also have other important information on it. This is, however, a great resource to use to see how many people you'll be up against. You can also check to see if your friends will be there.

,,,, The syllabus is the sheet that says which category you belong in, what songs you dance to, and what dances you do.

, if you have never competed before, you most likely fall into Beginner. Check with your teacher to be sure. For experienced competitors, check the syllabus and it will say where you belong. Read carefully above each table where it lists the category name, and then it should say, ""For dancers who have won__________in________category or something similar.

, This is whatever age you are under, or going to be. For example, if it's February, you're 11 years old and you turn 12 in the summer, and your feis is in April, you would list yourself as Beginner, U12.

, Beginners typically do a reel and a light jig, and a slip jig is also a choice if they feel they're ready. Check with your teacher to see if s/he thinks you're ready for a slip jig. Find your U under your category (in the table on the left hand column it should say, ""U12"" and then three numbers). For a reel, light jig and slip jig, the numbers are usually in the 120's. Fill them in. So in the lines it might say, ""Beginner U12, 121, 122, 123.""

,, This should be the head director of your school. The names of student or assistant teachers are NOT appropriate in this field and may be disregarded.

, Most feisanna charge something like $8 per dance. For example, $8 times three dances = $24.

, This is a fee for any parties who want to watch you dance. If you are dancing with no one in the audience with you (sometimes you're better off that way, because family only agitates you at a feis) you have no gate fee to pay. Instead of a gate fee, however, many feiseanna now ask that everyone pays a ""basic fee,"" which is only once per family.

, This is your total fee.

, On the school's website, they will post lots of important information, so check for things like your competition number and which stage and time you're dancing on (there are like 4). It will include information about the venue (not driving directions though!), local restaurants and lodging and anything else they feel you should know about where you'll be dancing. Some studios mail out the competitor numbers to the school you dance at, and you find the index card with your name on the back. On the front is your number.

, Press your palms together as though you are praying, then, slowly, raise your hands above your head (still with the palms pressed together). Slowly rotate your palms outward then lower your arms. Your shoulders should now be sufficiently back. Do NOT do that on stage.

, Your thumb should be on the inside of your fists. Place your thumb against your palm and cover your thumb with the rest of your fingers.

, If you've seen Irish dance, then you probably know that a good Irish dancer will hold her arms close to her side, and she will keep them straight. You should do the same. Straighten your arms and tuck them just behind you. They should always stay against your body and, ideally, you should look armless if viewed from the front.

, It will look very strange if your wrists are turned out, behind you.

,, The middle of your right foot should be touching your left toes

, When you are about to begin dancing, bring your right foot straight out to ""point"" Your right foot should be directly out from your left knee

, To point, curl your toes downward and point your entire foot. Straighten your legs so that you have a smooth line from your hip, to your knee, down to your toes.

, Only your big toe should touch the floor. You can achieve this by turning the inside of your right ankle out (to the left).

Get in the Irish dancing position.,
Next, you do preparation.,
Now, you take the right foot and point it again, hop with your left foot, and place your right foot in the back.,
Next, you do a jump.,
Now, you take your left foot and lift it up so that's bent at about a 90 degree angle behind your right leg.,

,
With your left foot, start on your toe and roll across the ball of your foot to your heel, so you're ending up on your heel.",How to Do the Slip Jig," If you want to begin the slip jig on your right foot, place the heel of your right foot against the toes of your left foot. Turn out your left and right foot. Turning out means to have your foot on a slight diagonal rather than keeping it parallel. If you're starting on your left foot, follow these directions vice versa. Every slip jig starts on the right foot, but These directions will have it starting on the right foot, so follow them vice versa for the left foot way of doing it. Keep your arms glued to your side. They will stay like that for the whole dance. Make fists, but leave your thumbs out and point them downward.;
, That means you point your right toe when the music gets to '7' (The beat will go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) On 8, you'll go up in relieve (meaning going up on tiptoe). Make sure you KEEP TURNED OUT.

, You should now be in the reverse position than how you started, so it should look like you're in Irish dancing position. Repeat this step, but use the left foot to point, use the right foot to hop, and put the left foot in the back. You should be in the same exact position you began the entire slip jig in (Irish dancing position).

, Taking the right foot, you lift it and leap. Your left leg should come up and be bent. It should almost be as if you're kicking your rear. Then, taking your left foot, step with it ON RELEVE in front of your right leg, then do another step with your right leg in front of that one. Step twice more in the same way you just did. Now jump with the left leg, but don't do the two extra steps. (The pattern should be 'jump, step, step, step, step, jump, step, step).

, It should be positioned behind the knee. Go to that position with a hop on your right foot. Then, do the leg lift step again, only hopping on the left foot and putting the right leg in front of the knee of the left leg, again at about a 90 degree angle. Then, do two steps. Step first with the right foot, then with the left foot.

, Then, swing it behind the left leg.

, (Move to the right) Now, abruptly cut the slide and bring your right leg in front, to the 90 degree angle position in front of the left leg. Do two steps (one on the right foot, one on the left foot).

, Now, so five steps in a circle to bring you around to the front again. Start them on your left foot.

,, Step firmly with your right foot, not on releve.

Go to a craft store/sewing store, such as Jo-Ann's or Michael's, to buy the elastics and anything else you may need.,

To put your elastics on, you first need to put your shoes on.,
It helps to sit down to do this, with the foot you're working on stretched out in front of you.

Put the elastic around your foot.,
Twist the front part around, so that the elastic looks like the number eight.

,
Take the front loop of the elastic, point your foot, and put your foot through it.

The elastic should now be wrapped twice around your foot and ankle area.

,
Now, reach down to the arch of your shoe and pull out whatever remaining elastic you can manage to stretch.

,
Try to twist it again, to make another small figure eight.,
Wrap this loop around the heel of your shoe.

Find a dance instructor.,
Get the right shoes.,
Find your perfect outfit.",How to Irish Dance1," Irish dance is an incredibly complicated style unique unto its own in the dancing world. Because of its complexities, it is nearly impossible to teach it to yourself. You can begin to learn basic footwork on your own, but to become a successful Irish dancer it is imperative that you find your own dance instructor.


Most dance studios won’t offer Irish dance as a style, because it is so different from most other popular styles of dance. Try looking for Irish dance studios in your area that specialize only in this unique form. You can google it for nearby dance schools.
There are many private dance instructors/choreographers who can give private Irish dance lessons, so try looking for one in your area. Though it will offer a much different experience to joining a dance school.;
, As with most types of dance, certain shoes must be worn in order to perform a traditional Irish dance. Unfortunately, Irish dance shoes are not available in most dance or shoe stores, they are usually bought pre-used from your teacher or as a competition/feis, or even custom ordered online. Only do this once you have started dance lessons and are 100% sure that you want to continue.


Ghillies/Soft shoes are a type of soft-soled shoes used for dancing jigs and reels. They are similar to ballet slippers in appearance, but have more structure and only lace to the ankle.






Hardshoes are a special type of shoe with a heavy heel attached to the bottom to make sound during a dance. These are similar to tap shoes, but instead of a metal heel hardshoes are made with a wood or fiberglass heel.






If you are interested in eventually entering competitions with your Irish dance, it is good to have a special pair of performance shoes which you keep solely for the times you are in competition. This way, they won’t get scuffed and will always look neat and clean., Only do this once you have started competing. Your dance school should have a school dress/vest but before that you will probably compete in a beginners outfit (white blouse, and a skirt that's your school colors knee-length skirt for girls and white button down shirt, and blue/black pants for boys). Irish dance emphasizes having traditional dance costumes during performances. Although to start you may not want to invest in some of the pricier outfits, eventually it will become necessary to purchase a classic dance costume.


Solo costumes are the most elaborate and are incredibly expensive. You won’t need to buy one of these fancy costumes at the beginning of your dance career, but when you begin to perform in shows having your own solo costume may be necessary.






Beginner, novice, and prizewinner dancers often dance in groups, so you will most likely have to buy a matching dance costume for this purpose.
Irish dancers put a lot of time and effort into their hair as a part of their costume. Typically, long hair is worn in incredibly tight ringlets. If you aren’t able or willing to achieve this style with your hair, you can purchase a wig to be worn for competitions.

Again, rip or cut a piece of black duct tape, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long.

Do the hurdlers stretch.,
Do a plank.,
Stretch your ankles.,
Keep good posture.",How to Irish Dance2," To perform this, sit on the floor with one leg extended in front of you, and the other one drawn up with the knee bend and your foot flat on the floor. Reach forward with both your arms to touch the toes (or reach past the toes) on your extended foot. Keep your leg straight with no bend in the knee, and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Repeat this several times on both legs.

, This is performed similar to a push-up and builds abdominal strength and endurance. Lay on your stomach, and then lift yourself up using your toes and your forearms, keeping your entire body straight as a board. Hold this for at least 15 seconds to start, and gradually add on time.

, You can do this a multitude of ways, but the easiest is to stand and lift one foot off the ground at a time, rolling your ankle in small circles in each direction., Pull your shoulders back and down. Make you neck long, and keep your chin parallel to the floor. You must only squeeze the inner-upper parts of your arms so they stay directly by your side, with your hands in the shape of fists. Your legs should be straight with locked knees. You should always be on your toes, and even if a leg in the air, all toes on both feet should be points. Also, your feet must be pointed outwards. It is a hard concept to grasp, but after a while of dancing it will be second nature to dance with your feet turned outwards. Try walking around home, school, work, etc, with your feet turned out for a half hour everyday. It will train your feet, telling them that they need to stick out. Another way to teach your feet to turn out is to go ice skating. When you skate, your feet have to be turned out to accelerate. Pay close attention to your feet next time you go ice skating

Begin by holding onto a surface at waist height such as a desk or a sturdy chair. Go into full pointe on one foot and pick the other up off the ground while using the desk for support. (It's okay if you have to bend your knee, but as your hard shoes become more broken in, try to straighten it more and more.) Meanwhile, repeatedly tap the heel of your standing foot with the toe of your standing foot. This will help give your shoe the flexibility you need to do a toe stand. Switch feet and do the same exercise on the other foot.

"
"
Do your homework.,
Write down the pro's of the shoe you decide you want (handmade Irish leather, extra padding in the metatarsal and ball of foot area, etc.),
If your current shoes are in American sizes, use the conversion chart they provide you with to get an idea of your UK/Irish size.

,
Also, note the price of the shoe.

,
When your parents bring up the subject of new shoes, make your case.,
If your parents seem interested, answer any of their questions with the list you made (how so, how much do they cost, etc.),
Tell them that they have to be ordered online, and wait for your parents' reaction.

,
If they say yes, buy the shoes and enjoy dancing in them!

,
If they say no, ask them why: because they are uncomfortable with shopping online or because they are wary of what size to buy you?,
If they still say no, stop trying to push them towards buying, but rather towards making a compromise: agree to one more pair of your current brand, and then to this: most Irish dance schools (and some websites) will accept used ghillies and hard shoes (along with costumes, etc.)",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Pair of Corrs Irish Step Shoes," Log onto their website (www.corrsirishshoes.com ) and, in the sidebar, select the type of shoe you need (Irish Soft Shoe, Irish Hard Shoe, Men and Boys Reel Shoe, etc.) and read the descriptions of all of their different makes.;
, and then compare them to the shoes you currently dance in.

,,, Say something like, ""Mom, Dad, I'm not sure I want to get another pair of shoes. I've been reading about this other brand, Corrs, and their shoes seem like they'd be so much more comfortable to dance in.""

,

,,, If they say they are uncomfortable with shopping online, point out that Corrs uses one of the best shopper security systems out there. If it's because they don't know your size, point out that Corrs will help you find the right size via phone or e-mail.

, and give you the money you can use to buy your next pair. See if they would agree to that.

Know what dances you're doing and check the schedule.,

Eat a good breakfast.,
Always be in the hall and ready an hour before you are scheduled to dance.,
Smile!,
Don't become too obsessive.,
Don't walk around the feis in a leotard and bloomers all day.,
Be respectful.,
Participate in trophy dances.,
Tell your teacher how you did.,
Most importantly, have fun and enjoy yourself!",How to Have a Successful Feis," Sometimes the schedule will be very late in coming up on the school's website, so you might need to check a couple of times.;
, At least a week before the feis, start practicing all of your dances twice a day. Make sure that you have the right music for each one. It is amazing what a difference this can make.


It helps to practice at least once wearing your full costume. This way you can get used to the weight, the skirt, the wig, and everything.
Also, when you put your costume on, keep in mind that it should go over your head. You'll need someone taller than you to do this. Don't step into your dress.
If you just got new shoes or new tips, break them in or adjust to them.

, Make sure that all of your clothing is clean and bright, especially your white socks! Do not wash your solo dress or school dress. This can have very bad results.


If you think your dress is dirty, (which, if you take good care of it, it shouldn't get that way) ask your teacher if they know of a good dry-cleaner in the area that they trust with the dresses. Also, if you have a new (or new to you) dress that needs a quick alteration, the place your teacher recommends can usually take care of that, too.

, For example, better height, more turnout, timing, etc. Ask your teacher what they think you could be better at. Practice your dances using these tips, but don't forget about the dance as a whole!

, This is often the hotel at which the feis is being held, which is very convenient (if they're holding the feis at a hotel). If the feis will be held at a large arena or convention center, the hotel will usually be the one that people stay in when they come to see concerts or go to conventions. Also, make sure to ask for the ""feis rate,"" a discount price on the room.

, Get everything out and ready. Don't leave anything till the morning. This includes making snacks. Do you have:




Sock glue

Tape or resin (so you don't slip, because you never know!)
Something to hold your number!


Dancers forget these things a lot, and if you remember it when you pack then you won't have to buy it from a traveling salesperson at the feis!

, Be sure to use conditioner for soft hair. Although you cannot see your hair under the wig, it will make your experience much nicer. Make sure to not put too much conditioner because then your wig will have a hard time ""clipping in"".If you shave your legs, shave. It doesn't matter if you wear tights or bubble socks, it makes a difference.

, This will put the value of your dress up, make it last longer, as well as simply making it more pleasant for those around you. Remember, the one place where dresses stain is the armpits.

, This is crucial to your success. Whole grains contain complex carbs, which are good for your muscles and blood circulation, and meat and eggs are full of protein, which you should be eating regardless of how often you dance. Don't forget milk, yogurt and other sources of calcium and vitamin D, which are essential to your bones.

, Even though most feis' run late it is better to be safe rather than sorry.

, Believe it or not, part of your score is deportment, which means that you need to look like you are enjoying yourself, respecting the judge, and your opponents. In the higher levels, many dancers don't smile at all. If you do, you will set yourself apart and stick out in the judge's mind.


Keep in mind, though, that you never want to have this big, cheesy grin on your face. You need to look like you're focusing on the dance, but also like you're enjoying it.

, While a competitive attitude will only help you, if you are obsessing over every little thing, you won't have fun. And that ruins your day.

, Bring sweatpants and a shirt that will fit over or around your wig.

, If you do place, try not to jump up and down and squeal. There are lots of girls who have not had your fortune, and may be upset by your show of happiness. It is also a bit tacky to wear your medals around the hall.

, While they do not help you move up, they are fun and create the opportunity to take home a trophy. When the results of the trophy dance are being announced, wear your dress and look presentable, in case you need to go up and receive your trophy. This is also important if you're in Prelim. (Intermediate in other countries) or Opens, because all the awards are trophy ceremonies. There will be lots of parents taking pictures, so you want to look nice. Also, don't wear your medals up to receive your trophy. See step 14.

, They will probably be there, and will always be encouraging.

, Listen to music, look at other girl's dresses, check out the vendors.

Stand with your shoulders back and down.,
Cross your feet.,
Put your hands to your sides.",How to Dance an Irish Jig1," No Irish dancer is ever caught slouching. Your head should be held high and proud.;
, You'll be in a position similar to ballet's closed 4th. Then, point your right toe outward. This closed position is what you should return to at all times. This open position should be taken when you point to begin the step.

, They should be just a pinch further back than normal because of the position of your shoulders. Put your hands into fists, but be careful not to clench them -- you don't want to tense up.

"
"
Assume the position.,
Do a hop, side, hop, skip, 2-3.,
Hop, skip, 2-3 twice more.,
Hop, side, hop, skip, 2-3 once more.,
Hop, hop back, hop back 2-3-4.,
Finish the circle leading with the left.",How to Dance an Irish Jig2," This is stance as described in the previous section. Your right toe should be pointed outward and your hands at your sides.

, Lift up your pointed right toe for a hop. Move around to the right side, doing a double hop on your skip, and place your right two down on 2, back toe down on 3. Keep your toes up the entire time, both feet turned out.

, You should be circling counterclockwise, about halfway around in a circle by this juncture. As you move around, make sure your toes are always pointed and your heel off the ground.


Straighten your knee when doing the skips and bring it back fully toward your butt on the return. Keep your torso steady as you use your leg's full range of motion. You should land with your right foot forward on 3.

, Only this time, lead with your left. It should end crossed in front of your right foot, still on your toes.

, Do this with your right leg, lifting your knees high. The first step is a normal hop, but the second two are hops back. The second hop back is with your left leg, landing on the ground on 2, shift weight forward to the right on 3, and back to the left on 4.


When you do your hops, try to bring your foot above your knee. The higher, the better. When you're skipping, try to touch your butt with the back of your foot before you bring it forward.

, Now that you're halfway around, repeat the same steps, but this time starting with your left foot pointed out in front of you. Return to the position on the floor at which you started.


That's it! You've mastered the Lead Around!

"
"
Assume the opening position.,
Point your right foot and put it in back.,
Lift your knee and walk in place for a seven.,
Point and put it in back once more for each leg.,
Lift up your knee, step in, and point in back to finish.",How to Dance an Irish Jig3," Just assume from now on that at the beginning of every dance, your right toe is pointed in front, your left foot is pointed outward, and your shoulders low and back, hands at your side.

, Then, point your left foot and put it in back. When you ""put it in back,"" put it in the same opening foot position -- closed and crossed.

, That's a lifted knee on 1 (the right knee) and walking (on your toes) for 2,3,4,5,6, and 7. On 7, place your left foot solid on the ground.


When you lift your knee, really lift your knee and keep your toe pointed. The more exaggerated you feel, the better it probably looks.

, This takes up an 8-count. Start again with your right foot, taking 4 counts. If you say it aloud, ""point"" is on 1, ""back"" is on 3, with silence on 4. For the left foot, point on 5, back on 7.

, Again with the right knee, lift it high and place it down in front of your left foot. The ""step in"" serves as a ball change; when you place your right foot down on ""step,"" shift your weight to your left foot on ""in."" When your weight is on your left, point your right foot forward and bring it back to conclude the step.


Once you get the basics down, make it ""hoppy."" There should be a livelihood to your points and knee lifts that makes it seem like you're sort of jumping. With every accented step, add a small hop on your back foot.

"
"
Do two tip-switches.,
Rally.,
Pop back.,
Do once more, leading with the other foot.",How to Dance an Irish Jig4," Starting in the opening position, brush the tip of your toe on the floor and quickly bring it behind you. This should go very fast. When you bring it back, place all your weight on it, in preparation for doing a tip-switch with your left.


In most other Irish dances, you would be bringing your foot up to your butt when you bring it back. Not so with the Hornpipe. You should be keeping your leg straight, leading with your heel. The majority of work with this step is done with your feet, not your legs.

, This is a fancy term for tapping the floor twice with your toe. Your feet should be in the crossed position, front toe pointed. Tap the ground twice making a sturdy noise to carry the beat.

, With the opposite foot you just rallied with (that is, the one you had your weight on), do a little hop. As you're hopping, bring your leg around (the one you rallied with) and place it behind on the beat after the hop. Land in the crossed position.


The only time your knee should be slightly utilized is when you go back after the pop. When you bring it back, lift it up and point your toe to the ground.

, The pop back should leave you standing on the foot you didn't start off with before. Repeat as many times as necessary to your music -- since this step is so simple, keep practicing until you can do it very, very fast.

"
"
Do a hop-point followed by a hop-toe.,
Hop 1-2-3.,
Do the point-hop-toe for your left.,
Hop bringing your right foot forward and do 7s to the right.,
Hop back on your right and do 7s to the left.,
Do once more, leading with the left.",How to Dance an Irish Jig5," This means you hop on your back foot (the left) and point with your right in quick succession. Then, hop again with your back foot and bring your right behind (bending sharply at the knee) and place your toe on the floor.


When you think of it, it should be more of a point-hop-toe (if you were to utter it aloud). The first hop is on the same beat as the point.

, With your left foot (the one firmly planted on the ground at this juncture), do a small hop, crossing your right in front on 1. On 2, step with your left and on 3, bring your weight forward on your right. Always keep your feet crossed and toes pointed.

, At the end of your right point-hop-toe, swing your left around to lead. Repeat in the same fashion, always keeping your knees up, toes pointed, and feet crossed.

, On count 1, hop with your right, landing on 2, crossing over with your left on 3, and moving to the right until 7. You'll be making 6 steps to the right, finishing on your left foot.

, This is the same thing, only on count 1 hop with your right, crossing behind your left. Move to the left until 7, finishing on your right.

, Just as in every other Irish step, discussed, repeat the same pattern but with the left foot starting. You'll want to do 7s to the left for starters, and then 7s to the right.


When you finish, end in the opening position.

"
"
Assume the closed position with your partner.,
Feel the rhythm.,
Use the samba bounce.,
Look straight ahead.,
Step on count 1.,
Bring your other foot in for the ah-2 steps.,
Reverse the steps.,
Add in a side step.,
Practice the steps.,
Graduate to the progressive basic movement.,
Learn the whisk.,
Try the stationary samba walk.,
Dance the samba walk.",How to Samba," Closed position is when partners hold each other while facing each other. The leader, usually a man, places his right hand high on the back of the follower, often a woman. The leader holds the follower's right hand high in his left, at about the follower's eye level.The follower places her left arm along the leader's arm, resting her hand on his shoulder. The leader's right hand is placed along the follower's shoulder blade. The follower's arm will rest on top of the leader's. Both partner's arms will be perpendicular to the floor., Sambas have a very specific rhythm. Count your steps this way: 1-ah-2, 2-ah-2, or 3-ah-4. You take three steps in two beats.


The second step, the ah step, is a quick step. Only part of your weight will be put into it. That makes the samba beat feel like bum-ba-bum., Your form will not stay stationary as you go through the steps. You will do the samba bounce as you perform the steps. As you step forwards and backwards, lift your feet like you are stepping over an object, like a log or pencil.Keep your upper torso relatively straight and your knees soft. As you step on count 1, step with a bent knee like you are stepping over something. When your legs get back together, keep knees soft and slightly bent as you shift your weight.


This is a fluid motion. It's like a slight uplifting motion as you move back and forth. Your body should bounce slightly as you go through the steps.

, When dancing Latin ballroom, look straight ahead. The head should be stacked over your shoulders and hips.Think about the saying, ""The nose shoulder follow the toes.""


Look over your partner's right shoulder. This helps give you something to focus on as you dance., When you step on each count, the leader and follower will be going through the same steps, but mirrored. When the leader goes forward, the follower will go backwards. When the leader uses the left foot, the follower uses the right foot.


If you are the leader, take a step forward with your left foot on count 1.
If you are the follower, take a step backwards with your right foot on count 1.Remember the samba bounce. Bend the knees and keep them soft while you go through the steps.

, This next step, on the ah, is a quick step. Step your other foot right beside the one you moved in the previous count. Shift your weight to your other foot, making sure not to put full pressure on this foot. Then, on the 2 count, shift your weight completely back to the first foot. This should be done quickly.Your feet might seem like they are doing a march step as you complete this ah-2 count.
Your weight will end up back on the foot you led with.
If you are the leader, you will be stepping your right foot forward beside your left, then shifting partial body weight to the right foot during the ah count.
If you are the follower, you will be stepping your left foot back beside your right, then shifting partial body weight to the left foot during the ah count.
Let your hips sway as you bounce right and left while keeping your upper body still.
This should put you back into your initial, neutral position.

, Complete the same sequence of steps to the same count, but this time reverse them. The leader will be going backwards and the follower will be going forwards.


If you are the leader, step backward on your right foot, bring your left foot back next to it. Shift your weight quickly to the left on the ah count then back to the right on the 2 count.
If you are the follower, step forward on your left foot, then bring your right foot forward next to it. Shift part of your weight to the right foot on the ah and then back to the left on the 2 count.
When you step with the left foot, make sure you step with the ball flat against the floor. When you change to the quick ah count, quickly press with the ball of the right foot. When you step again with the left foot, make sure to keep it ball-flat., After you have mastered the basic and reverse basic steps, you can add a basic side step to your routine. The basic side step is completed exactly like the basic and reverse basic, except instead of going forwards and backwards, you step right and left.Start in the same closed position. If you are the leader, step right on the 1 count; if you are the follower, step left. Bring the other foot in so it is beside the foot that led.
If you are the leader, you will bring your left foot in and shift partial weight onto it on the ah step. If you are the follower, you will bring in your right foot. Transfer you weight back onto your leading foot on the 2 count.
Step sideways the opposite way. If you are the leader, you will step left on the 1 count; if you are the follower, you will step right. Complete the same steps.

, Turn on some salsa music and go through these steps until they become automatic.

, The progressive basic movement is a combination of the natural basic movement and the basic side step. Start by going through one measure of the basic move, then after you complete that, go into a side step instead of another basic. This allows you to travel around the dance floor., The whisk is a variation on the basic side step. Instead of bringing the other foot to meet your leading foot, you bring the other foot behind you.


If you are the leader, step to the right on the 1 count. Bring your left foot diagonally close behind your leading foot. On the ah count, transfer some weight back onto the foot diagonally behind your right foot, then the full weight back onto the right foot.
If you are the follower, step to the left on the 1 count. Bring your right foot diagonally closer behind your left foot. Shift a small amount of weight onto your right foot on the ah count, then shift back fully onto the left foot.When you change directions, you will be stepping with the diagonal, back foot. The step will be a bit wider than in the basic step.
Remember to keep light weight on the back foot. You are not just pointing the toe, but shifting weight from foot to foot. This step also is a type of march.

, A stationary samba walk is completed in closed position with a two-hand hold, unlike the previous one-hand hold. The arms are extended. The leader has the left leg extended behind him, while the follower has the right leg extended behind her. The inside leg is the stabilizing leg. The partners don't travel anywhere, but remain in one area.


Bring the leg that is extended behind forwards to meet with the stabilizing foot on the 1 count. The leader will bring forward the left leg; the follower will bring forward the right leg. The arms will bend a bit as the two bodies draw closer together.
Step the opposite foot back, with the toe turned out on the ah count. Part of your weight should be in your back foot.
On the 2 count, slide your stabilizing, inside foot back about 3 inches (8 cm), placing all your weight back on the stabilizing foot.Step in and repeat the steps for the other side.

, The samba walk is a travelling position done very similarly to the stationary samba walk, but in promenade position. Promenade position is very similar to closed position, except it's an open V position. The leader's left side and the follower's right side should be turned slightly open. The other side will be close together.For this move, start with the outside leg diagonal behind your inside, stabilizing leg.


Step the back leg forward in front of the inside leg on the 1 count. On the ah count, step the inside leg back, with the toe turned out. You should shift part of your weight to this leg. If you are the leader, you will start by stepping forward with the left leg, then step the right leg back; if you are the follower, you will use the opposite legs.
For the 2 count, slide the front leg back about 3 inches (8 cm) and transfer all your weight to that leg.
Step forward with the back leg on the 1 count, then step backwards with the other leg on the ah count. Make sure the toe is turned out and you shift part of your weight on it. If you are the leader, you will start by stepping forward with your right leg; if you are the follower, you will start with the left.
Slide the front leg back about 3 inches (8 cm) on the 2 count, then transfer your weight to that leg. That completes the move for both legs.
You should be travelling a little across the dance floor as you complete this move.

Stand over your partner in the yike stand.",How to Yike," This dance is done with a partner, so you need to find someone to dance with. Your partner, boyfriend, or girlfriend is a great choice, but if you're single, ask someone at the club to dance with you.While this dance isn't always done with a partner, it often is.;
, Yiking isn't exactly a hands off dance, so if you're going to yike with someone, make sure it's someone you don't mind getting up close and personal with. It involves some grinding and touching of each other's bodies, so make sure you're comfortable with that., If you know what twerking is (moving your butt up and down to the beat), yiking takes it to the next level. Partially, it's more intense because it involves a partner, but you also include more movement (side-to-side)., Start by bending over a bit and sticking your butt out. You can place your hands on your knees if that helps. Also, try to arch your back a bit so your butt sticks out. Your legs should be about shoulder-width apart.With a partner, your butt should basically be up against the other person's front.

, Once you get in position, it's time to swing your hips to the beat. Lift your right leg up and step out a bit, though don't actually move over. Swing your hip to follow your leg, with your butt swinging out. Next, swing your left hip out, though don't step this time. Just move your hip and butt out to the left.Your butt should follow your hip, not lead., Once you've swung right and left (to the beat), move your butt back to the center. Make a wave with your body. Dip your head down and bring it up. As you move, bring the wave along your back and up through your butt. The final point of the move is bringing your butt up., If the music goes faster, you may not be able to dip fast enough to stay in time with the beat. If that's the case, you can change to the tic toc. With your butt still out and in the center, shift your weight back and forth by bringing each knee slightly forward in turn. That will shift your butt back and forth behind you.Don't step forward, just shift your weight.

, As you're swaying, you can also bring it down to the floor. You want to keep your butt in the air, but you'll have your knees almost all the way to the ground (not on the ground) and your hands on the ground. Keep swaying your butt back and forth.Either person can do this move!

, To move to a yike stand, you need to have your forearms on the floor. However, instead of your knees close to the floor, you'll keep your legs straight, lifting your butt into the air towards your partner. You'll continue to sway in time to the beat.You should pivot on the balls of your feet to move back and forth.

, To be on the back end of the yike, you start out with your legs apart, about shoulder-width. With your hands out in front of you, hold on to the other person's waist, at least to begin with., Step out with your right leg, but don't move outward. You're basically stepping into the same place. Follow your hip with your butt. You should be leaning into the person in front of you, not sticking your butt out as much., When your partner dips, dip your hips into it as well. You want to stay connected with your partner through the whole dance. When your partner tic tocs, you don't need to tic toc at the same time, but you should still have your hands on the person's hips or butt to move along with them.You can also add your own moves while your partner is dipping, such as dipping your shoulders or bringing a leg up.

, When your partner goes into the yike stand, the person's legs should go between yours. You should have your legs spread out over your partner, moving your hips along with theirs. Keep your hands on their hip so that you can help keep both of you moving together."

, When practicing the different moves, make an effort to always be moving in a straight line either to the side, front and back. This will be especially important when you are dancing with groups of people.

, While the steps and the counts or each dance are set, your own style will make your dancing stand out. You can choose how to move your hips, upper torso and arms to stand apart from the crowd.

Most people are accustomed to switching on every beat, so holding it for two may seem difficult at first, but it stays in time with the zydeco music, which is based on eight beats.Which foot you start on depends on your partner. You usually start on opposite feet so that you're stepping on the same side.;
, Once you've held for two beats on the one foot, you switch over to the other foot, say the right foot this time. On this foot, you only step for a single beat, rather than two. This rhythm is known as a syncopated rhythm., Now, switch back to the other foot, the left one, but only hold for a single beat. When you go to your right foot this time, you'll hold for two beats instead of one. It takes some getting used to, but with some practice, you can get the hang of it., The last two steps take a single beat each. Just like throughout the rest of the dance, you'll alternate. You'll step on your left foot for a beat, then your right foot for a single beat.To recap from the beginning, you'll step on your left foot for two beats, right for one, left for one, right for two beats, left for one, and right for one, which equals a total of eight beats. Then you repeat from the beginning.

, It can be hard to remember to hold for the extra beat, so zydeco dancers use different techniques to make holding easier. For instance, you can twist or turn your foot to take up an extra beat. Alternatively, you can take a little step, or try a brush, where you sweep your foot along the floor for the extra beat., To get the beat and steps down, try practicing in place by shifting back and forth on your feet to take a ""step."" Count it out loud as ""slow,"" ""quick,"" ""quick,"" ""slow,"" ""quick,"" ""quick."" Once you get the beat down, you can add in movement., The closed position is what you typically think of when two people dance together, such as in a ballroom dance. One person has their hand on the other person's waist (usually the person who's leading), while the other person has their hand on the first person's shoulder. With the other hands, you clasp them together, holding them outward., The open position is, as it sounds, much more open. You stand further apart, about 2 to 3 feet. You mostly don't touch, though sometimes you will touch one hand together (the one that you normally clasp together). You dance facing each other, trying to stay mostly in sync., You don't have to stay in one position the whole dance. You can change it up. Start out in the closed position, for instance, and move into the open position for the middle part of the song, then change back to the closed position for the end., Often, you'll just be shifting your weight back and forth on your feet in zydeco, so it's the extra steps where you'll get movement. For instance, once you go through the first eight beats, you can add a rock step on the first beat, the ""slow"" beat. A rock step is just where you step back with that foot and rock back on it, shifting your weight back. Then, move your foot back forward.It helps to pull towards your partner a bit before you step back.
You can use the rock step to move into the open position. As you rock back, take another step or two back, just staying connected with your clasped hands.

, If you already have the rock step down (or even if you don't), you can also add a side step. You don't actually need to move, but on the other slow step, you step out to the side, then bring your foot back in. So you step out to the side, take two quick steps, then rock back on your other foot., One way to add movement to this dance is to use the slide. When you take a ""slow"" or two-beat step, slide to one side. Your partner should be moving with you. When you get back to the next two-beat step, you slide again the other direction. In between, you shift your weight back and forth on the beat.The slide is done in the open position.
You can also change up what you do when you are doing the ""quick"" beats, such as tapping one foot instead of alternating or creating a ""V"" with that foot.

, As you get used to the stepping movements, you can move around the dance floor by taking steps in different directions. Make sure one person is leading, guiding the other person around, so that you don't crash into each other."

Start by putting on a song with a good beat.,
Start with the side-to-side move.,
Sway right, left, right, right.,
Add some arms once you feel you have the style down.,
Try the ""Cat-Daddy,"" another popular Dougie move.,
Try the ""Wheelchair"" move.,
Now do the Dougie ""Fresh!"",
Don't forget to be loose with your knees.",How to Learn to Dance the My Dougie," Ideally ""My Dougie"" by Lil' Will or ""Teach Me How to Dougie"" by Cali Swag District should be on. But you can technically do the Dougie to any song with a good hip hop beat.






;
, Begin swaying back and forth, starting with the right. Pause for a beat while putting your weight on the foot on the side you're leaning, thinking right step out, left tap. Then sway to the left and repeat.You can do it to the beat, or double-time every third beat.









Put your own rhythm into it so it feels comfortable. Keep your knees loose and remember, right step out, left tap. Left side out, right tap.

Don't bring the ""tap"" all the way in; it's just a light touch on the floor.



, Follow it up with left, right, left, left. This is the same move, only you're swaying the the same side twice after you've swayed both right and left (or left and right). Think, ""one and two and double this side."" The start of each section should begin on the 1 and 5 -- right and 2 and 3 and 4 and left and 6 and 7 and 8.









Start feeling it in your arms. That's the next step! Get your shoulders into the groove, release your knees, and relax your hips. The style comes all from you.
Step out on the whole counts -- 1, 2, 3, and 4. Tap on the ""and"" beats, so it's 1 tap 2 tap 3 tap 4.

, As you're doing the side-to-side movement, bring your hand (on the side you're swaying to) towards you in a fist in a counter-clockwise circle motion, until your arm is bent with your elbow facing down and your first up by your head. Do this move with the sway of the same side and then again with the opposite arm. Don't overcomplicate it!









This arm-movement is the most popular Dougie arm move, but some other versions include arm-pops, rolls, etc. Whatever works for you, include in your Dougie. We'll cover some variations next.
Try ""driving your car."" With the side you're swaying on, grab the steering wheel and sway your arm back and forth. Then bring it in to incorporate other moves.

, Punch down by your hip with the arm of the opposite side (e.g. right hip, left arm). This is similar to the arm movement just discussed, only on a slightly lower level. Bring your hips and knees down with your arms, too, lowering your entire body.








, With both your arms, make forward circles to your sides like you're pushing yourself in a wheelchair (you probably saw that one coming). At the same time, start crouching lower with each rotation, either with your knees going forward or to the sides (like the chicken-wing move with your legs!). Vary this one up with the moves already discussed as the music progresses.








, This move is signature for all styles of Dougie. Bring your hand over the top of your head and slide it off the back, like you're slicking your hair down. Greasing the mullet, if you will. Do this with the side-to-side move, shifting your shoulders side to side, then do it with the other hand. Vary your levels with this move too.








, Otherwise you're going to look very stiff! That is not how you want the dance to look -- it's all about feeling the beat and flowing with the motion of the music. It helps to shake around and let your arms and legs feel free before dancing, just to get in the groove. Add your own personal flair to the dance as well. Basically, just have fun!

Get into a squat position.,
Pop your booty outward.,
Shake your booty back and forth.",How to Twerk1," You don’t want to be too low to the ground, but low enough so that you are grounded and easily balanced. Consider keeping your knees behind your toes to avoid knee injury. Stand with your legs wide apart, lower to the ground, with your feet turned out. This will help you maintain your balance once you start moving. This is the most common way to twerk, and is the least sexually provocative.









Pick a fun, fast beat and start practicing! You can practice twerking slowly at first, to get the basic move down, and pick up your pace once you're comfortable with it.;
, Get into the stance where it looks like you are about to sit into a chair-- think ""chair pose"" in yoga -- your booty should be the main attraction. Make sure to keep your knees bent and to place your hands on your hips. Keep your upper body pretty straight and look straight ahead. You don't need to look at the ground to twerk effectively.









As you pop your booty out, you should lean forward about 45 degrees, shifting your weight to your toes. This is known as the ""Miley Twerk"". If you want to be a bit less scandalous, then you don't have to lean forward as much, and can keep your chest upright.

, If you choose to keep your hands on your hips while you twerk, then you should press your thumbs into your butt bones to help push your hips go forward if you're moving forward; to move your booty back, use your other fingers to pull back on your hip bones to help your booty move backward. If you're comfortable twerking without your hands, then you can lift your arms straight out in front of you, close together and parallel to the ground, and gently sway them as you continue to twerk.









For the Miley Twerk, you should move your hips quickly from right to left; for a standard twerk, pop your booty up and down, arching and straightening your back to get the best results. And don't worry if you don't have a big booty. Anyone can rock this move!
It's all about isolating the lower half of your body. Try to keep the upper half of your body pretty stable.
You can also switch it up with your hands, keeping them up in front of you, out at your sides, or back on your hips.
Additionally, you can get even a bit lower the ground, placing your hands above your knees, with your fingers pointed toward each other and your wrists facing out, and shake your booty with your hands helping you get the most for your money.
If you're really going for it, add a Miley face or hand signal for good measure.

Get a hold of a group of friends and a camera.,
Get two sets of costumes and some ridiculous props.,
Find an appropriate location for going crazy.,
While filming, have someone wearing a mask dance alone for approximately 15 seconds.,
In the same location, record another 15 seconds of everyone else dancing.,
Edit the clips together, dubbing over the entire video with the first 30 seconds of Baauer’s “Harlem Shake."",
Save your changes and share your own “Harlem Shake” video with the world!",How to Make a Harlem Shake Video," It'll pretty hard to do the Harlem Shake if no one's shaking, and even harder to make a video without a camera. The more people in the video, the merrier -- but try to aim to at least have half a dozen or so. With more people, the video will be more visually entertaining.


Get a group together that has vastly different styles. Does Dave do a mean robot? Julia does a creepily accurate impression of Miley Cyrus? Does Jaime get kind of shy in front of a camera, but can bust out an awkwardly funny hip thrust? Awesome.;
, Let's say you're filming your video in the school library. At the beginning, the group is wearing cardigans, glasses, loafers, and pocket protectors. Helmeted man busts in, does his thing, and with a quick cut, all of a sudden the dorks and geeks of the library scene are flailing about in squirrel outfits and massive amounts of sequins. The change-up is what makes the video so darn captivating.


Obviously that squirrel is dancing with a top hat and cane. Sequin girl is holding a boombox above her head and awkward Jaime in the back has so much bling he can barely stand up under the weight. And where did that disco ball in the corner come from?

, You'll be busting out the meanest dance moves since the Macarena, so make sure wherever you are, hitting the floor is completely kosher. You want to find a place that's between the mediocrity of your basement and the illegality of a five-star French restaurant. Unless you know the owner, of course.


Try to have a unique setting where it's natural for people to be going about their daily lives. A locker room, the library (...possibly frowned upon...), the mall, maybe even a downtown walk? Just make sure the people not involved in the video won't ask too many questions!

, This is how long it takes for the song to build up until the beat “drops”. Everyone in the surrounding is to pay absolutely no attention to the masked dancer, going about their business in silent oblivion.


This mask just has to obscure their head. It could be a helmet, a ski hat, a cardboard box -- whatever keeps the dancer anonymous and stands out.

, People should be going all out with the dancing; the crazier, the better! Extensive use of props and costumes is encouraged.


To make the video more visually appealing, incorporate variety. No two people should be dancing the same way, and there should be visual levels; you can have a boy doing the “worm” across the floor, while some people are dancing on tables. The more visually interesting you can make the frame, the better the video.

, The video of the lone dancer should play until the song goes “Do the Harlem Shake!”, at which point the video should cut to everybody dancing. This goes on for another 15 seconds, until the lion’s roar sounds in the song. That is the end of the video.


Your computer probably comes with some type of movie making program. Uploading the video should give you the option to edit, where you will be prompted to your default program. You can also take a quick look at video editing programs with a quick Google search -- many have free downloads.

, Upload it onto YouTube and share it with all your Facebook friends. Maybe yours will be the next one that goes viral. Why not?

Stand about two feet away from a sturdy wall.,
Put your hands on the floor.,
Walk your feet up the wall and bend your knees as you shake your booty.",How to Twerk2," Stand facing away from the wall but within close proximity so you can see the wall in your peripheral vision. Now, this is the most showy form of twerking. Make sure you don't think this is a good idea after you've had one drink too many, or you'll be fixing for a fall. When you attempt the wall twerk, you should already be pretty confident in your twerking abilities. This move is not for amateurs.


You need to have a lot of upper body strength and good coordination to pull this one off.

, This time you want to make sure you have a strong grip on the floor as you will be walking your feet up the wall so you don’t want to fall. Your entire hands should be on the ground to give you the balance you need. Get your booty high in the air to make it easier to get your legs up there. Your hands should be down about a foot in front of your feet, shoulder width apart. As you place both hands on the ground, shift the weight from your legs to your hands.









Your torso and upper body should essentially be in handstand position. Your fingers should be facing away from you.

, First, place one leg on the wall, get it up there until you feel stable, and then move the other leg up to join it. Your feet should be wide apart, about one foot away from each hip. Get your toes firmly on the wall and practice arching your back and hallowing it, creating the basic twerk move. Keep your arms and upper body strong and stable as you rock out with your lower body (which will be above your upper body!). You can think of this as a version of the ""hands on the ground"" twerk -- except that this time, you're up on a wall.









You should aim to be up there for thirty seconds, or maybe even a minute or the length of a short song, but remember that your hands and shoulders will get tired after a while. 
This is also a great opportunity for grabbing a wall twerking partner to join you as you show off those moves!
Make sure to come down gracefully. Move your feet back down the wall, one at a time. You can continue doing the ""hands on the ground"" twerk, or just take a complete break from twerking for a little while until you're ready to channel your inner-Miley again.

"
"
Stand with your legs parallel and separated.,
Put your hands on the ground.,
Pop your booty.",How to Twerk3,"  Make sure your legs are straight and your torso is facing forward. They should be wider than hip distance apart. If they're too close together, it'll be hard for you to bend down to twerk effectively.

, Turn your toes out as you lean down. You can have a slight bend in your legs and make sure at least your fingertips touch the ground. If you're more flexible, nobody's stopping you from getting your entire hands down on the ground. This will help you maintain your own balance.

, Bend and straighten your legs quickly, accentuating the booty pop during the move. Bend and straighten your legs along with the rhythm of the music.  You can also shake and move your booty as you twerk. To do the regular twerk, just arch your back and then hallow it out, letting your booty move up and down, up and down. For the Miley, quickly wiggle your hips from left to right.

, There are often multiple dancers in one video doing different things, and you don't want to get confused over what you're supposed to be doing. If you are learning the dance alone, however, it may be more advantageous and interesting for your audience to follow whichever dancer is in front at the time. It's your choice.

Get loose.,
Jump forward.At the start of the first chorus, you will jump forward with both feet, landing about one step ahead of your original position with both feet landing and the ground simultaneously.,
Jump back.,
Twist to the right.,
Twist to the left.,
Do a four step.The simplest way to do the steps is to take a separate step for each step of a four-count beat.,

Step up, back, then do a cha-cha step.,
Mix it up.",How to Do the Wobble," The music starts up before the dance does. Instead of breaking into the dance “cold” or from a standing position, feel the music and groove to the beat in your own style by swinging arms around or rocking slightly from side to side for an eight-count, until the dance actually starts.;
,


As soon as your feet hit the ground, count the step as step one of a four-count step. Bounce, wobble or shake your booty for the remaining beats of the four-count.

, After wobbling your hips to the front, you need to get ready to do it to the back. Jump backward with both feet, landing roughly at your original position with both feet landing on the ground simultaneously.


As soon as your feet hit the ground, count the step as step one of your next four-count step. Again, bounce, groove or shake your hips for the remaining counts.

, Step back with your right leg so that the foot points straight to your original left. The left leg should remain in its original position with the foot twisted so that it is only partially facing the left.


Your torso should be slightly twisted, as well, so that you are facing the left. Lean back with your torso just a bit to the right.
Wobble to your right side by leaning toward that side and swaying your hips and shoulders. Do this for a four-count beat.

, This time, you will need to step back with your left leg so that the foot points straight to your original right. The right leg should remain in its original position with the foot twisted so that it is only partially facing the right.


Your torso should be slightly twisted, as well, so that you are facing the right. Lean back with your torso just a bit to the left.
Wobble to your left side by leaning that direction and swaying your hips and shoulders. Continue for a four-count beat.

, Keep your body loose and your hips swaying as you step to avoid losing the fun and losing the rhythm as you step. Your arms should also sway or swing loosely.


On beat one, step forward one pace with your right leg.
On beat two, step forward one pace with your left leg, bringing it together with your right leg again.
On beat three, step back one pace with you right leg, returning it to its original position.
Finish up with beat four by stepping back one pace with your left leg, returning it to its original position and bringing it together with the right leg again.

, Your body will need to follow.


The turning should be natural, so you will need to turn to the beat and turn without taking deliberate steps. Keep the swaying or wobbling the focus of this part, rather than the actions of your feet.

, Once you are facing to the left, you will repeat each step all over again.


Jump forward and groove to the beat.
Jump backward and groove to the beat.
Twist and wobble to the right.
Twist and wobble to the left.
Do your steps.
Sway from side to side as you glide to your left. At this point, you will be facing a full 180 degrees from your original position.
Continue wobbling until you make a full rotation or until the song ends.

, Sway them from side to side. You should be able to complete a full sway that goes from left to right within one count of the four-count beat.


Your arms should also cross in front of each other as you wobble your hips. Keep your arms crossing to the beat, as well.

, Your shoulders and hips will take turns swaying from front to back, causing your torso to wobble from front to back. When the hips are toward the front, your shoulders should be toward the back, and vice versa.


Think of a waving flag. Try to mimic the way the flag waves, wiggles, and wobbles in the breeze using your torso.

, The easiest way to occupy your hands while you twist is to do a hand roll, in which your two hands circle each other front and back at the front side of your body, roughly at chest level. Do this hand roll to the beat.The hand roll is not the only move you could use, though. You could also point side to side, wave your arms, or do whatever else feels natural with your own personal groove. This part of the wobble is usually just improvised.

, Once you have the basic steps down, you will want to work on your moves in between each part. You can add more style to your wobble by developing more complex footwork, wobbling different parts of the body, and using your arms.

, Once you get the hang of the four-step, considering adding the cha-cha to your wobble repertoire.


As before, keep your body loose and your hips swaying as you step to avoid losing the fun and losing the rhythm as you step. Your arms should also sway or swing loosely.
On beat one of the four-count beat, step forward one pace with your right leg.
On beat two of the four-count beat, step forward one pace with your left leg, bringing it together with your right leg.
Between beats three and four of the four-count beat, do a cha-cha step. Essentially, you will rapidly step back with your right foot, left foot, and right foot again, taking three steps in two beats. Make sure to sway your hips a bit more during this cha-cha step to emphasize it.

, The final way people often do the steps for the wobble is to do their cha-cha steps in place. As with the other techniques, you should keep your body loose and your hips swaying as you step to avoid losing the fun and losing the rhythm as you step. Your arms should sway or swing loosely, as well.


On beat one of the four-count beat, step forward one pace with your right leg.
On beat two of the four-count beat, step backward one pace with your left leg, bringing it further apart from your right leg.
Between beats three and four of the four-count beat, you will do a cha-cha step. Rapidly step in place with your right foot, left foot, and right foot again, taking three steps in two beats. These steps will not change the ending position of your feet, however. You should also make sure to sway your hips a bit more during this cha-cha step to emphasize it.

, You will need to repeat the steps twice during this part of the wobble. As a result, you can mix things up and use a combination of different stepping techniques described above for each turn. You can also mix up how much or little you wobble different body parts, and how animated your arm movements are. Keep it interesting and have fun!

Go into a basic push-up position.,
Curl your toes in.,
Bring your legs up at a 90 degree angle.,
Kick and push.,
Land back on your toes.,
Try variations.",How to Do the Worm," With your hands even with your chest, rest your body on the ground, Keep your shoulders back and your hips forward to do the worm. Make sure you've stretched your back before attempting it., One of the most important parts of the move is keeping your toes curled in, so you can use them to push and create the distinctive ""wave"" that starts the move. You can't push up if your toes are pointed straight back. Use them to grip and push yourself up and forward once you've kicked.

, Lift your feet so the bottoms of your feet are pointing straight up toward the sky. Practice donkey-kicking up and back to get your hips off the ground. This is the easiest way to get the move started, but takes some practice to get the physics of it right.

, To try the first motion, kick your legs up and back. With your hips off the ground, push up with your hands as you would to do a regular push-up. Let your feet come down first and let your hips, stomach, and chest roll back forward to the push-up position. This will send that wave-like motion through your body.


Get the rhythm down and practice getting more of your body off the ground with each kick.

, It's important to remember that the move starts from your toes. Keep them curled in and land with your toes ready to immediately push off again. Chain several of these 'kick-and-push' moves together to do the worm.

, Once you've got the basic motion down, you can change the way the move starts, how many times you do it, and how high. You can also start the worm from a kneeling position by rolling forward from your knees and kicking up and back when you roll all the way forward onto your hands.


Try a backward worm by starting from a standing position. Put your hands on the ground and kick your legs up in the air as if you were about to do a handstand. Instead, let your body lower to the ground by rolling from the chest to the stomach and the hips. When your toes touch, push off as you normally would and push-up with your hands again. Your momentum should carry you in the opposite direction."

Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart.,
Stick your left foot out.,
Lean in the opposite direction.,
Move the ""stuck"" leg in a circular motion.,
Get your arms into it.,
Switch legs.,
Keep going.,
Add some flair to your moves.",How to Do the Stanky Leg," This a good neutral stance and is perfect for getting you going once the music comes on. Make sure the ""Stanky Legg"" is about to start playing. Now, you can choose whether you want to have a ""something in here stanks"" look on your face or not; some people think it adds something to the dance, while others think it's just not sexy.;
, Plant it on the ground. You can alternately start with your right foot if you want -- what's important is that you keep switching legs.

, That means you should lean towards your right foot with your body and arms.

, For now, your right leg is the ""stanky"" leg -- the leg that just doesn't work right. While you should have planted your left foot down, you should be standing on the inner side of your right foot. Move that foot in a circle, so that your knee almost turns to face your left planted foot. Yeah, this will feel a little weird, and it should.

, You can do whatever you want with your arms, as long as you move them to the beat of the music, leaning them toward the non-stanky leg along with the rest of your body. The most common thing to do, and what is done in the video, is to move your arms up a bit, like you're flapping your wings, and then move them in and cross them. Repeat this one more time before you switch legs, making sure to move your whole body to the beat.


So: move your stanky leg in a circular motion, move your arms up and down twice, and keep your normal leg planted before you switch.

, Now, your left leg will become the stanky leg and your right leg will become your planted leg, so make sure to plant that leg firmly. You can switch legs simply by leaning your body over to your other side, by stepping your stanky leg behind you and stepping your non-stanky leg out before you switch, so your legs are in line with your shoulders, or you can even make it a more subtle motion, by keeping your torso more upright when you switch.

, Once you've moved on the other leg for at least two beats, you can switch right back to the first leg being the stanky leg. You don't have to switch after you've moved your arms up and down twice; you can stick to one leg for a few extra beats if you want, as long as you do what feels good. The Stanky Leg isn't like the Electric Slide, where every little move is coordinated. It's all about having fun; as long as you have one stanky leg, you can do whatever you want with your body.

, Guys can lean forward toward the non-stanky leg in an exaggerated manner, and even move the non-stanky leg forward in front of the stanky leg instead of to the side of it. Girls can shake their booties a bit more, working their hands above their heads and down below their necks to make the dance a little more sexy. And anyone can even drop by squatting down for a second and then popping back up before you switch legs. Once you've got the leg work down, the rest is up to you. You can also add elements of the Dougie dance while you do the stanky leg. Now go out on the dance floor and show off what you've got!

This is when you're moving a part of your body but nothing else -- hence isolating it. It may sound simple, but it's very difficult to move any part of your body without at least minimally affecting another. With the robotic like sounds of dubstep, it's essential.


Stand in front of the mirror. Start with your head and neck and move down your body, attempting to rotate each part of you independently. Go counterclockwise and clockwise with every part -- your shoulders, chest, abs, hips, down to your ankles. Work with the smallest bits -- finger, fingers, wrists, forearms -- once you get the hang of it. Nothing else should be moving.

When you get the hang of moving in circles, experiment moving up and down. You'll be moving on different planes while isolated for the majority of the time. For example, when moving your arm up and down, you're not using your wrist or elbow. Hold it strong, but move your arm leading with your shoulder; in fact, only your shoulder should be working.

;
, There are many helpful YouTube tutorials that take you through this process. Basically, you are moving your abs outwards and back in at a fast paced rate or to the beat of the music. With dubstep, that's pretty quickly.


Think of your body like a clam shell that's opening and closing. Your top and bottom halves should be coming in to meet at the middle. Practice this until you have it down, as it forms many of the basic moves to dubstep.

, You'll be doing a lot of work in slow motion. This means that the majority of the time your weight will not be evenly spread on both legs. And because of the smooth flow of the slow-mo parts and the choppiness of the glitchy parts, there is no wavering in dubstep.


There will be times when you're on your toes or the sides of your feet. Start practicing now! Yoga will help, too.

, Unlike something classic like the waltz (a simple 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), dubstep goes very fast; often you'll be hitting 1/8 notes and the likes thereof. If you can't hear it, you can't dance to it.


Find a song you want to dance to and start drumming it. When you can hit all the filler notes (the small ones aside from the 1, 2, 3, 4) with your hands, you can start doing it with your body.

"

Vibrate.,
Stop.,
Be convincing in slow motion.,
Get twitchy.,
Glide.,
Do the wave.",How to Dubstep Dance2," In almost all dubstep songs, there is a sub-base (where the music itself seems to vibrate) -- the music changes from accenting 1, 2, 3, 4 to 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 quite clearly. When you hear this, it's appropriate vibrating time.


Bend your knees into a slight squatting position. Release them back up mostly, so that you are moving your body slightly up and down. You're basically shaking with conviction ever so slightly. Do this quickly and subtly. You want to minimize your movement but increase your speed as to have your body sort of vibrate, not jerk around.
Do it even lighter with your arms and hands. If your appendages move too much, you'll look like a gay T-rex running from a meteor. Or at the very least like you suffer from epilepsy.

, Dubstep music goes from very fast and choppy to slow and smooth. When you're transitioning, hit a split second dead stop. You'll be doing your robot thang, BAM, and into your slow-motion groove. The stop should be barely perceptible -- in fact, only you should know you hit it -- but it will accentuate the transition.


This will generally always be on the downbeat. There will be a very clear point where your fast movements die and slow motion should take over. Which brings us to...

, Everyone can move slowly. Most of us do. But in order to do slow motion and look like you're actually in slow motion, you gotta stay alert to every part of your body. Your eyes must blink slower, your feet must hit the ground at slower angles, and you even gotta swallow slower.


It's easy to get your core down, but following through with your feet will probably be the hardest part. Once the tip hits the ground, it's tempting to put all your weight down. Ultimately, this is a balance issue that you will get better at with time.

, A common sound in dubstep sounds, quite frankly, glitchy. It's akin to a broken record or a scratched CD when a certain beat is repeated over and over. When that happens, small twitches go from normal, everyday movements, to quite visually interesting shifts.


Start with just your head. Twitch it back and forth along with the music. It should just be 4 or so head shakes -- it doesn't last long.
Work on different levels. Bending at the knees, take your body down a bit on each beat, being careful not to move your arms or neck/head. You're not only working left and right, but vertically.
Isolate your arms. On each beat of the ""twitch"" move your arm/s independently from your body. The rest of you should not be moving. Make sure to hit every beat of the glitch!

, You know the move -- it looks almost ethereal. You're going to pivot onto your toe and lean all of your weight onto it. Remember how we talked about balance? This is precisely why. The knee above your pivoted foot should be bent.


Then, slide the other foot away from you. This foot should never come off the ground. It is literally sliding. If you can't slide, change shoes. Always, always, always have one foot with a pointed toe and one foot on the ground.
Switch. Your flat foot should take up a mirrored pivoted, heel up position and your other foot should be put flat on the ground, turning in. Take this foot and slide it in toward you. Repeat. That's really all it is!
Remember: the knee is bent on the heel that is popped. One heel is always popped, so one knee is too.

, Bet you never thought that would be popular again, huh? There are two basic waves: the arm wave and the body wave. Both of these are heavy on the isolation skills. Let's start with the arm wave:


For the arm wave, hold one arm out. Throw your hand down, followed by bending your elbow up. If it has to be said again, isolations. Then, shrug the nearest shoulder, momentarily followed by expanding your chest. Repeat along the other arm, starting from the shoulder.
For the body wave, imagine pulling a bar through your chest. Your shoulders should roll back and your chest should stick out, starting the wave movement. The further your chest is out, the better. Then, pull the bar down, shrinking your chest back and your stomach out. What's next? The same thing -- pull that bar down a bit more, pulling your stomach in and your hips out.

To end it, pop into a sitting position. Not moving your core (isolations!), pop out your knees (on your tiptoes), fold them in, and center your weight. When you master this wave going down, take it back up in the reverse.

"
Jump to the left!,
Step to the right (four times)!,
Put your hands on your hips!,
Bring your knees in tight!,
Do the pelvic thrust (twice)!,
Swivel your hips!,
End by jumping back and forth and waving your hands to the beat.,
Fall to the ground.",How to Do the Time Warp1," Position your legs close together, with your feet pointed forward or slightly apart. Jump with both feet off the ground, and land a short distance to your left. Keep facing the same direction during this jump.


If you want to make the jump more exciting, wiggle your hands in the air as you jump, or bob to the beat after you land.;
, Keep your left foot planted on the ground, and stay facing the same direction during this dance move. Move your right foot way out to the right, then bring your legs back together. Usually, the dancers actually repeat this movement four times, just touching their toes to the ground the first three times.On the fourth time, plant your foot on the ground, so you're standing with a wide stance.


If you like, move your hands out and in again in time with your feet.

, Throw your hands right over your head. Make an exaggerated wiggling movement back down to your hips.

, Keep still for a moment, long enough for someone to sing ""bring your knees in–."" When they would say ""tight,"" rapidly bring your knees toward each other, without moving your feet. Keep your hands on your hips, bending at the hips if you need to to keep your balance.


Don't worry too much about the timing of this move while you are practicing. It's easier to get the timing down with the music playing, or when practicing synchronized with other people.

, Bring your butt back, then thrust your hips and pelvis suddenly forward. Lean your legs forward and your head and shoulders backward slightly while you thrust, to make it more exaggerated. Repeat this motion a second time.


Keep your hands on your hips.

, This isn't part of the song lyrics, but it's still one of the dance motions. Keep your hands on your hips, and rotate your hips and pelvis in a circle. You can do this in one smooth motion, as though you were spinning a hula hoop, or wiggle as you rotate in time to the song's beat.


If you're listening to the song, do this motion during the lyrics ""that really drives you insa-a-ane.""

, Jump in place, turning 90º to the right, so you're facing where your right arm was before. Jump a second time, turning 180º, so you turn completely around and face the opposite direction. Move your arms and legs in and out to the beat as the chorus finishes.


If you're listening to the song, time it so the first jump happens during ""Let's do,"" the second jump during ""the Time Warp,"" and the arm motions during ""Again.""
You can come up with your own dance moves for this part of the song, since there are no specific instructions. You could even just wave your arms and jump around during this part.

, At the end of the song, after you've done the Time Warp during all three choruses, fall to the ground dramatically as the music fades."

Add variations.",How to Do the Hokey Pokey," This dance is traditionally done with everyone standing in a circle, with enough space between each person so that people can move around without bumping into one another. You should have about an arm's length between you and the people on either side of you.


However, if you're performing the dance for an audience, then the dancers will all stand facing the front, in multiple staggered rows if necessary, so everyone can see your moves.;
, As the first lyrics go, ""You put your right foot in."" Simply place that right foot out in front of you and let it hang a few inches from the floor or just move it out in front of you and point your foot on the floor. You can keep your hands on your hips or at your sides. Most people like to sing the song along with doing the motions, so you can join the singing! This can get your energy up and make it easier to remember what moves to do next.

, As the next lyrics go, ""You put your right foot out."" Just take that foot and move it back to its starting position, next to your other foot.

, As the next words go, ""You put your right foot in and you shake it all about."" Now, just put that right foot in again and shake it back and forth, up and down, or however you'd like to shake it. Just make sure to keep your balance!

, As the next lyrics go, ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around..."" Now, you can just place each arm out and up at your sides at a ninety degree angle, point the fingers of both hands and wiggle them up and down as you turn yourself around. This only takes a few seconds, so make sure to keep up with your fellow dancers!

, After you're done turning yourself around, just clap once or twice at these lyrics. For a variation, you can clap your hands down on your knees instead.


Congratulations! You've done one full cycle of the hokey pokey—now, you'll repeat these same motions with different parts of your body until the song is over.

, Follow the lyrics, ""You put your left foot in."" Now, place your left foot in, a few feet out in front of you. You can either point it or let it hover a few feet above the ground; repeat whatever you did with your left foot.

, Follow the lyrics, ""You put your left foot out."" Now, just move your left foot back to its original position.

, Follow the lyrics, ""You put your left foot in and you shake it all about."" Now, just put your left foot back out in front of you and shake it around as much as you want!

, Follow the words, ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around."" Simply do the hokey pokey dance again and turn around in a circle, so that you're facing forward again once the words are over.

, After you're done turning yourself around, just clap once or twice at these lyrics. For a variation, you can clap your hands down on your knees instead.

, As the first words to the song go, ""You put your right hand in..."" Just dip down a bit and place your right hand in to the center of the circle or out in front of you. You can leave your other arm at your side or keep it up on your hip, depending on what you and the group decide. It's that simple.

, As the song goes, ""You put your right hand out..."" Now, take that right hand and place it back at your side or out at your side. Just exaggerate the gesture a bit. Again, keep your left hand either at your side or on your hip, depending on where it was before.

, As the song goes, ""You put your right hand in..."" Just do exactly what you did before with your right hand.

, Next, the song says, ""And you shake it all about."" This just means you shake that hand up and down, from side to side, or however you want to shake it. You can get a little crazy and really shake it up and down, depending on your energy level!

, Follow the words, ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around"" and do the hokey pokey and turn around again.

, After you're done turning yourself around, just clap once or twice at these lyrics. For a variation, you can clap your hands down on your knees instead.

, Follow the words, ""You put your left hand in."" Place your left hand out in front of you.

, Follow the words, ""You put your left hand out."" Just move your left hand back ""in"" and either return it to its original position or let it hover above your left side a bit.

, Follow the words, ""You put your left hand in and you shake it all about."" Simply place that hand back in and shake it however much you want to.

, Follow the words, ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around"" and do the hokey pokey and turn around again.

, After you're done turning yourself around, just clap once or twice at these lyrics. For a variation, you can clap your hands down on your knees instead.

, Follow the words, ""You put your whole self in,"" and either jump around a foot into the center of the circle or lean your body forward. This is the final ""body part"" that you will move during the hokey pokey, no matter what variations may come before it!

, Follow the words, ""You put your whole self out."" Now, just either jump back to your original position or lean back to your starting position, depending on what you did to ""put your whole self in.""

, Follow the words, ""You put your whole self in and you shake it all about."" Just move your body around from side to side, moving your hands up and down at your sides. You can lower and raise your body, shimmy, point your fingers, or really do anything you'd like to do in order to ""shake it all about"" once last time!

, Follow the words, ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around"" and do the hokey pokey and turn around again.


There are some variations of the end of this dance that repeat the words ""That's what it's all about"" an extra time for a grand finale.

, After you're done turning yourself around, just clap once or twice at these lyrics. For a variation, you can clap your hands down on your knees instead. Congratulations—you're all done! Repeat as many times as you'd like until the fun wears off!

, If you really want to be an expert at the Hokey Pokey, then you should know the song before you begin the dance. This will help you get oriented with what to do next with your body, and it will also just help you have more fun when you're doing the dance! Though the words change slightly depending on where and with whom you're singing them, here's what you should know:






You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out
You put your right foot in
And you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about!
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out
You put your left foot in
And you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about!
You put your right hand in
You put your right hand out
You put your right hand in
And you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about!
You put your left hand in
You put your left hand out
You put your left hand in
And you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about!
You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out
You put your whole self in
And you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about!





, Though the version here only uses the arms, feet, and whole body, you can add as many variations to this dance as you'd like, as long as you still end with the whole body. Once you finish the arms and legs, you can also add other body parts, such as putting the nose, shoulders, knees, elbows, or even your bottom into the mix!


You should also note that, in some versions of the song, the arms go in before the feet. It's all up to you!
In some versions of the song, the lyrics for the lines that say, ""You put your out,"" actually go, ""You take your out,"" instead.

Wear a Halloween costume.,
Dress in glitter and sequins.,
Dress with one of the simpler costumes from the show.,
Avoid stripes if you're going to a Rocky Horror show.",How to Do the Time Warp2," From zombies to princesses, Halloween costumes fit right in for the Time Warp. The flashier and zanier the better, whether that's piles of pink ruffles and glitter, or skeleton face paint.

, One of the dancing characters from the Rocky Horror film version, Columbia, has the flashiest costume of all. Cover yourself in gold or rainbow sequins and glittery makeup to imitate her. Bonus points if you wear a glittery top hat and fishnet stockings, or cover your eyebrows with makeup., The characters Janet and Brad are the quiet, ""normal"" people caught in a group of strange people, which means their costumes are usually easier to imitate. Dress as Janet by wearing a light pink dress and a white sweater, plus a sun hat. Dress as Brad with ""hipster"" clothing, for instance a tucked-in button-up shirt, khaki pants, and combed-back hair., At many performances of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, where the Time Warp dance comes from, people might make fun of you for wearing stripes. This supposedly references a scene in the movie when someone wearing a striped shirt was caught on camera accidentally, but it's a tradition of it's own at this point."

Pick an arm to start with.,
Start moving an arm.,
Switch to the other arm.,
Add in head and chest movements.,
Add a slight bounce.",How to Do the Jerk1," The jerk mainly focuses on moving your arms in time to the beat of whatever song you are dancing to. To get this dance move started you will need to pick an arm to begin the movement with. Either arm will work just as well when you are starting the jerk.








Start with both arms at waist level.
Place both arms in front of your waist.
Pick and arm to get started with.;
, After you decide which arm to start the move with you will begin to move that arm upwards. The overall aim of the movement is to swing your arm up from waist level to a point that is by your head. Keep some of the following tips in mind as you move your arm:








Your arm will be extended in front of you. However, don't keep your arm too tight or straight.
The motion should be loose. You will swing your arm up from waist level.
Bring the arm all the way up to head level.
At the peak of the motion your arm will be bent at a ninety degree angle and your hand will be next to your head.

, After your one arm has gone up to head level it's time to bring it back down. However, you will be moving your other arm up at the same time your first arm is coming back down. Your other arm will swing up in the exact same way as you did with your first arm. The arm going down should stop at waist level, ending a bit behind your waist.








Try to evenly switch your arms, bringing your first arm down and the other up at the same time.
Your arms should be meeting halfway through the movement.
Bring your arm up just like you did with the first arm.
Keep switching arms.

, Although the jerk focuses on your arms you will also need to move your head and chest. These movements will both be small and will be timed with the motion of your arms. Keep some of the following tips in mind as you work to add these head and chest flourishes:









Push your chest out whenever an arm is swung up to your head level.
Sink your chest in when switching arms.
Turn your head to face whichever hand you are swinging up to head level.

, There is no footwork for you to learn when practicing the jerk. However, you will still need to have some leg movement in order to make the whole dance flow. Try to incorporate some of these leg motions into your jerk dance:








Slightly bend your knees when switching arms.
Straighten your legs out when an arm is up at head level.

"
Crouch down on the floor.,
Put out the leg you're going to use as your ""helicopter blade."",
Lift up the hand on the same side of your ""helicopter blade"" leg as you swing that leg past it.,
Plant the lifted hand back on the ground and lift your other hand as your ""helicopter blade"" leg swings past it.,
Jump over your ""helicopter blade"" leg with your other leg as the ""blade"" leg swings past it.,
Swing your ""helicopter blade"" leg all the way around to where you started, and keep swinging it around until you run out of steam.,
Keep practicing.",How to Do the Helicopter," Just get down on the floor while placing your fingertips, or even your palms, all the way down on the ground in front of you. You can squat, with both feet equally positioned on the floor, on your toes. You can also use this position to get a bit more comfortable on your hands and feet, and to feel more secure in your balance. You can lean forward a bit until your palms are on the ground, and then bounce back to your feet. Repeat this movement a few times to feel more stable before you begin swinging one leg around.


Doing this can also help you figure out which leg you'd like to use as your ""helicopter blade."" See which foot you'd rather swing all the way around your body, and which one you feel more comfortable crouching on.;
, Stick your leg out straight to the side. Your toes can be flexed and pointed up or just pointed down at the floor. Maintain your balance on both of your hands as you do this. Typically, if you're right-handed, then your right leg will swing around counter-clockwise. If you are left-handed, then your left leg will swing around clockwise.


However, it may be that you feel more comfortable crouching on your dominant leg and swinging around your other leg. You'll have a better sense of what works best after you try a few times.

, Let's say you're using your left leg. If that's the case, then swing it clockwise, toward your right leg. As you do this, you'll lift up your left arm and hand so the leg can swing past it. One trick to maintaining your balance as you lift up one arm while swinging your leg past it is to plant as much weight as you can on your hands, leaning your chest over your hands, along with keeping your hips up high. This will help you maintain your strength and coordination as you lift up one hand, then the other.

, You'll have to lift your hands up one at a time so the leg can pass through, but you have to keep one on the ground at all times to maintain your balance.


At first, you should do this slowly, but as you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do it so quickly that it'll almost look like your hands are leaving the ground at the same time.

, You'll have to lift one hand, another, and then the other leg so that your ""helicopter blade"" leg can travel all the way around your body. You'll have to time it so your crouched leg lifts up while your other leg swings around so it can come right back down as soon as the leg passes through. Keep your chest forward, about even with your wrists, so you maintain your balance.

, As you keep swinging your leg around, repeating the motion over and over again, you should avoid having it touch the ground as much as you can. If your foot touches the ground, then you may lose your balance as well as your momentum.


Also, if your foot just keeps going around and around without touching the ground, you'll be able to build more momentum and will gain speed, truly making your leg look like the blade of a helicopter.

, As you develop your skills at the helicopter, you'll be able to go faster and faster, until you've truly mastered the move and it feels like second nature. You'll be able to fall into a rhythm and won't even think about when you should lift each of your hands and your crouched leg. Once you've got the basic helicopter down, here are some other tricks you can try:


Do the helicopter with your other foot out.
Do the reverse helicopter, which is the same as the regular helicopter, except you'll be moving your foot back behind you and around instead of in front of you and around. So, if you normally use your left foot, instead of swinging it forward and clockwise, you'll have to move it backward and counter-clockwise.
Transition into a more advanced break-dancing move. The helicopter is a basic break dancing skill, but the beauty of it is that it will allow you to transition into other more advanced tricks, such as the windmill, or the handstand.

"
Listen carefully to the song.,
Snap to the beat.,
Start moving your arms.",How to Do the Jerk2," Your body should feel a beat, which forms the rhythm of the song along with the tempo. Imagine the beat like a ticking of a clock or a metronome. Each tick is a beat, and the speed of these ticks form the rhythm. Find the beat in whatever song you want to dance to.









Doing the jerk isn’t something that most people do without music.

, Once you have found the beat start snapping your fingers in rhythm. Your finger snap will probably occur on a bass note or a drum beat. The finger snap is often incorporated into the dance when people are doing the jerk, so this is a good way to get started.









If you can’t snap your fingers try clapping your hands. The point of this exercise is to prepare your body to move with the rhythm of the song. Doing the jerk is partially about the move itself, but also about being in sync with the music.

, Move your arms casually back and forth across your body as you snap. Doing the jerk will require a more pronounced movement, but for now just swing your arms back and forth as you snap your finger to the beat. If your song is in 4

Add in a double motion.,
Change to the pony.,
Do the twist.",How to Do the Jerk3," You don't always have to switch arms when you are doing the jerk. If there is a change in beat or you just want to change the move up a bit, you can move the same arm twice or more. Adding the double motion can be a simple way to include a bit of variation to the jerk.

Bring your arm up to your head as you normally do.
Bring the arm back down again.
Don't switch to bringing your other arm up. Instead bring the same arm back up.

, The pony is a dance from the 60's that can blend nicely with the motions of the jerk. The move is an easy one to learn and can be a nice addition to your jerk moves. Take a look at the following overview to get the basics of the pony down:Take a big step to your left. Stand in place and step on your right foot then back to your left.
Take a big step to your right. Stand in place and step on your left foot then back to your right.
Have your arms down at hip level on the big step.
Bring your arms up with the smaller steps you take when standing place.

, The twist is a simple dance move that looks great and can work together nicely with the jerk. You will need to be on your toes, twisting the direction your heels face, and moving your weight from side to side. Keep some of the following basic steps in mind when practicing your twist:Stand on your toes.
Shift your legs and hips so that your heels are pointing either to the left or the right.
Shift your heels to the other side.
Keep this motion going and move your body from side to side, shifting your weight to your right or left leg.
You can throw in a squat while you are twisting your feet for some extra style.
Keep your arms loose and at about chest level, twisting them slightly from side to side.

Pick an outrageous setting.,
Get a group of people together.,
Get an outrageous costume.,
Start playing Baauer's Harlem Shake.,
When the chorus hits, everyone should start dancing.,
End the video in about 45 seconds.",How to Do the Harlem Shake1," The beauty of the Harlem Shake is that it can be done anywhere with anyone (it's better with people who don't dance, actually). The more outrageous the setting, the more outrageous the result.


Just stick to places that are legal (even though it's been done on a plane). If you can bust 'er out in a swanky French restaurant or in the middle of Chem class, that's ideal. Somewhere unexpected.;
, They should be pretty inconspicuous and match the setting. A couple of people is sufficient, but you'll probably get a better overall look with at least half a dozen. Whatever your number, make 'em look casual.


The more varied your group, the better your outcome will be. Do you have one friend that can breakdance? Super. Do you have one friend who you have to pay to be in this video, but when he busts out his Russian ballerina impression, jaws hit the floor? Better yet...do you have a friend with an armadillo costume? Speaking of which...

, Alright, so if you and your buddies are getting together and Harlem shaking for fun, might as well toss on your pajamas and make the best of it. But if you're going for hardcore YouTube glory, you're gonna need more of a spectacle. A certain ""look"" is best, but anything that's eye-catching will do.


In most videos, everyone has a certain identity. There's the one guy in the gorilla costume in the back being marvelous at being awkward, the one guy acting gangster as all get out, and the other guy that, for some reason, thought it would be a good idea to swing his belt around his head while his pants fall to the floor. Whatever look you choose, make it count!
But for the record, you're starting in street clothes -- or whatever matches your environment. The key is to start being perfectly blended in and then BAM! Shake. Groove. Slam.

, After a few moments, one person should start dancing. Generally, they'll start at the left side of the screen and move toward the right. In most interpretations, they have some sort of headgear on -- which allows for plenty of creativity!


Helmets, a ski mask, a turkey -- it all works. And it doesn't have to make sense. In fact, the more absurd, the better. Just covering the eyes works, too.

, By ""dancing,"" we mean flailing about wildly however you damn well please. This video is not about looking pretty or hitting beats 1 and 5 with a pointed toe. You do whatever you want as long as it's energized and matches the electronic dance beat of the music.


Don't be shy. Dance like nobody is watching! You can just close your eyes so you won't see the people around you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you have epilepsy or are being possessed, now's your chance! You've been waiting for this moment for years, haven't you?
In most videos, there's an obvious cut where the video starts back up but everyone's changed costumes. You do not have to be a video pro to do this.
This part is when you have one guy dropping trou off to the side, one girl doing hair flips constantly, and another guy in the back doing the electric slide in a giant squirrel outfit. You'll probably also have a friend who insists on standing there and just bobbing his head intimidatingly. Every group has one.

, Part of the reason the Harlem Shake craze is so big is because the ADD generation can handle it. It's quick and to the point. If you make it any longer, it gets repetitive and boring. And how long do you really want to watch yourself seizing?

Alternate popping shoulders, left and right.,
Do it in threes.,
Start using your arms.,
Add personality to it.,
Know that this is different than the video craze.",How to Do the Harlem Shake2," With every beat of the music, you'll pop a shoulder. ""Pop"" here meaning move it up and out to the side quickly. The rest of your body should sort of flow with each pop -- it's not only your shoulders that are moving.


You're sort of moving your shoulders in arch, starting from the inside and going out. When you pop your left shoulder, your right hip should jut out. The hips should follow behind the shoulder by just a split second.

, If you're popping your left shoulder first, go left, right, left. Then pop right, left, right. If you're working with music that's 4/4, you'll be using the half-beats, or the and of 1 and 2 (for example).


Start going faster and faster. Electronic dance music can be really, really, fast and keeping time is absolutely imperative.

, When you pop your shoulders, your arms should be bent at the elbows, with your forearms and hands going toward the other direction. So when you pop left, through your arms right. When you pop right, throw your arms left. Keep your hands in a loose fist.


When you pop a shoulder, it moves up a bit. To exaggerate this, move the other shoulder down a bit. When you add in your arms, this looks especially good and loosens you up. Your arms will then be at slightly different levels.

, Keeping the same basics (popping shoulders and opposite arms), get creative. Move your arms to shoulder level or even above your head. Add in a hand movement on the beats (dirt off your shoulder, maybe?) to jazz it up. It's still the Harlem Shake!


When you're working with music that's 4/4 (as most music is), alternate between working in threes (hitting pop, pop, pop on 1 and 2, 3 and 4), and working in twos (hitting pop, pop on 5, 6). So you might pop your shoulders five times on 1, and, 2, 3, 4 and then five more times on 5, and, 6, 7, 8.

, The Harlem Shake is a dance move that goes back to the 80s -- it's not just some recent YouTube phenomenon, despite what your friends may tell you. The video craze just involves dancing wildly and has nothing to do with this dance move.


However, if you want to get creative, do the Harlem Shake while you're making a Harlem Shake video. Only a few people will understand what you're doing, but they'll appreciate it!

Be patient.",How to Dance the Tango," The essence of tango is something you feel, not something you do. Any master of this art form will tell you that the music has to flow through you in order for you to truly grasp the tango. So start listening! Put it on in your car, have it on while you're doing dishes -- get to the point where you can tell where it's going. Then when you dance, there will be fewer surprises!


Need some names? Di Sarli, Canaro, Pugliese, D'Arienzo, and Laurenz are five names you should definitely check out. Throw on YouTube -- it's all at your fingertips.;
, This is numero uno when it comes to the tango. The embrace is physically simple, sure, but it must also be sensual, loose but firm, and poised. Generally speaking, both parties mirror each other.


Partner A (typically the man, though we'll try to be as astereotypical as possible) raises his (or her) left hand and wraps their right arm around their partner, placing their hand on her (or his as the case may be) back, centered slightly below the person's shoulder blades. Partner B then raises their right hand to partner A's left and places their left arm around B, with their hand on the center of A's back, as well.

, It may have started out in the poorer barrios of Argentina, but that doesn't mean that it hasn't evolved since. In order to give tango its proper due, you must dance with the correct posture. That means your head held high, your spine straight, your core strong and chest lifted, and confidence oozing from your body language.


With the wrong posture, not only will you look a little ridiculous, but you also risk injuring your partner. Imagine if you're all slumped over, forcing them to arch their back in abnormal ways and to step around your slightly-pigeon-toed feet like they're walking on eggshells. That's a quick way to get rid of any prospective partners!

, Before you get going with a partner -- especially if you're leading -- it's important to know the basic step. Imagine going into gym class in a mini-skirt and high heels! No thank you. You gotta be a little prepared for this kind of thing.


For both parties, remember this: slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. But for the leader, here's your five steps:

Forward with your left
Forward with your right
Forward with left
To the right with your right
Feet together, moving left to meet right. That's it! Repeat!


For the partner following (you're just mirroring):

Backward with your right
Backward with your left
Backward with your right
To the left with your left
Feet together, moving right to meet left. Ta da! Repeat!



, There's obviously more to it than slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, but that's the gist of it. Once you have that down and can do it in a counter-clockwise circle, grab someone to work with. Whether you're leading or following, feel their presence and flow with them. Otherwise you're dancing near each other, not with each other.


Experiment with different partners. Some will naturally be easier to work with than others. Certain styles just mesh together better than others. And, of course, if you can find someone who's a bit better than you, learn from them!

, In American style tango, progressive rocks are where you rock back and forth moving your weight from foot to foot instead of taking a step. So in the basic step we talked about, instead of quick, quick being two steps in one direction, it's one step and then rocking your weight forward. Clear as mud, yeah?


If you're leading, you're taking a two steps forward on quick, quick. Instead, take one step forward, and then throw your weight back onto your back foot (without moving it). If you're following, it's the opposite: step back on quick, and then move your weight forward on the second step.

, With progressive rocks and cortés, you can get two moves in one. The corté is the same as a progressive rock but on the first two steps (slow, slow). To give it more oomph, make sure your strides are long and fluid.

, Now have you and your partner facing the side -- this is called the promenade. Instead of thinking forward and back, you're thinking to the left or right. This way you can add in swivels and turns. In most tango forms, the follower (or woman) does most of the dirty work, but men can get in on the action, too!


Let's say, as partner B, you take two steps to the right (slow, slow). Immediately after that second step (and before the third), throw your torso to face the left. Then you resume moving backward. Swivel check!
For turns, the leader turns toward his partner 180 degrees on the first quick step and the one following steps between his feet. Now we're getting fancy!

, It would seem like leading is easier -- being able to read someone's mind is no easy feat -- but leading has its own perils, too. You always have to plan a step ahead and know where you want the dance to take you. So while you're working your way around the circle, think 8 steps into the future.

, You get to have the peace of mind that you just have to go with the flow. But going with the flow can be a little disconcerting if you don't trust. The easiest way to know that you're capable of depending on your partner is to feel their weight. Feel where it's going. Feel where it is between the moves. Balance with them. It'll take you with it.

, You can do all the fancy moves you want, but if you and your partner don't have that synchronicity, that gel, that essence is the tango, it doesn't matter. Don't feel pressured to spice it up. Stick to what you feel. Keep it simple, master the simple, and the rest will come.


Have you ever seen an old couple that just walks a simple dance together? How moving it is because you can see how they just get it? That. That is what you're aiming for.

, The teacher should be able to dance both lead and follow so he/she can teach you both how to do it and how it feels for your partner. Try to find a class that has a dozen or so people so you have a few partners to work with but still can seek individual attention.


There are three types of tango: Argentine tango, International Ballroom tango, and the American Ballroom tango. Argentine tango has become quite popular because of its free form, ad-lib steps and greater focus on the woman. Many amateur groups exist to teach and promote it.

, Whether you're in class or at a party, the tango generally happens in a circle. There are a couple things to know:


It moves counter-clockwise. You don't have to worry about turns, swivels, or anything fancy -- just know that you're moving counter-clockwise.
Generally speaking, the better tango-ers take larger steps and dominate more space. The less-confident dances end up getting relegated to the center of the circle, all smushed in by the more audacious dancers. Don't let this happen to you!

, If you go alone, find a partner to have a ""cabeceo"" with. However, you don't ask; you simply make eye contact. If you meet eyes, you smile or nod. If they don't meet your gaze, move on. It's less intrusive and doesn't leave one party pressured to say yes.


Generally, a round, or ""tanda,"" is 4 dances. So if you're not sure you want to dance with this person for 4 dances, ask them on the 2nd or 3rd!

, The tango requires balance and the willingness to learn. At first there will be a heck of a learning curve, but trust that it will go away. The steps will come. You'll step on a few toes, but they'll heal. If you keep with it, you'll only get better.


The tango is not a dance that can be learned in one evening or with one lesson. That is what makes the tango so much fun! There is so much to learn -- it can take you your whole lifetime to learn and understand the tango. But don't let that discourage you; let it intrigue you. When you've mastered it, you've mastered an art.

Learn to “hold the reins.” Start this arm movement by holding your arms out in front of you, mostly straight and at chest level.,

Learn the pattern.,
Combine your arm and leg movements.,
Practice.,
Bust a move.",How to Do the Gangnam Style Dance," Open your legs, and bend your knees slightly. Your feet should be planted roughly the same distance apart as your shoulders, and your back should be straight.


Keep your posture loose. You won't be standing still for very long.;
, Start with your right foot. Lift it straight up a little ways off the ground and return it, finishing with a small skip-step backward.


To perform the skip-step, let your foot hit the ground and bounce back up slightly, kicking it a few inches back rather than popping it up again. To keep your balance, you will have to hop a little bit, which is also a part of the dance.
Practice going back and forth from your right foot to your left and back again, until you feel like you can keep up a rhythm easily.

, Now that you're comfortable with the movement, you'll need to learn a simple pattern. The dance is performed in sets of four steps that alternate back and forth.


The pattern is as follows: right foot, left foot, right foot, right foot, followed by the opposite.

This means you step and skip once with your leading foot, once with the other foot, and then twice more with the leading foot. After that, switch your leading foot and repeat.


On the last two steps in each set, you'll find it's difficult to skip-step, since it naturally puts your weight onto your other foot. Do what Psy does and just keep your foot light, instead of taking a full skip-step on these steps. Don't kick back on them.
Practice this RLRR, LRLL pattern until you can keep a rhythm doing it.

,


Cross your right wrist over your left and hold them together. Your wrists should cross at the center line of your body rather than on one side or the other.
Lift your arms up and down in a loose bouncing movement, in time with the beat of the song. This movement is repeated eight times.

,


Lift your right arm up until your upper arm is about at shoulder level and your right elbow is pointing diagonally to the right.
Raise your right forearm so that it points straight up, and whip it in small circles to the beat of the song, as if you were a cowboy holding a rope lasso. This movement is repeated eight times as well.

, Fortunately, the pattern for the dance's arm movements is very simple. Start by ""holding the reins."" To a steady beat, bob your arms eight times, then switch to the ""lasso"" movement and wave your right arm eight times.

, Start with your arms holding the reins, and lead off with your right foot.


Know the combined pattern. Each set of eight arm movements corresponds to two sets of leg movements. Therefore, when you start out as described above, you'll “bob the reins” eight times, and step right, left, right, right, then left, right, left, left, all at the same time. Your arm movements and steps should match up.
Keep your head high. If you really were riding a horse, you'd want to be looking ahead to see what was down the road. Look straight ahead as you dance, too.
Feel the dance. Don't think you have to dance stiffly or in a controlled manner. As long as you're getting the arm and leg movements synched up properly, the rest of your body will naturally want to bounce and bob along with your limbs. Cut loose and get into it.

, Start out slowly and practice the dance over and over again, gradually speeding up until it seems like second nature to you. Gangnam Style has a fast tempo, so work your way up to it to avoid being frustrated.

, When you're ready, crank up the music and start dancing. Go out and show it off to people, or teach it to your friends. Have a good time!

These groups most often form in the middle of the dance floor. If you need a partner, start there., When you find a potential partner, glance at them twice. Offer a smile. Don’t stare. Someone who is interested in you will give you a sign, such as returning your glance and smiling.If you want to dance with someone you know, such as your significant other, you can avoid searching for a partner.

, Work your way over to potential partners. At low-key dances or when you’re not already dancing, simply walk over and ask for a dance. At a club, you can set the mood by dancing over to them and monitoring how she responds. Ask them for a dance. If they turn away, move on.


Out on the dance floor at a loud, packed club, you may get someone’s attention by gently touching their shoulder. Keep in mind that this can be offensive to some people.
Remember to check the area around your potential partner for significant others or protective friends. Avoid this trouble and approach someone else.

, Out on the dance floor, you may see groups of people grinding together, usually a mix of men and women. It’s not unusual to see two women “sandwiching” a man, grinding against him from both sides. This is a simple way to help you find a dance partner or start grinding with a new partner.

, When you start dancing, time your moves according to the song. Some songs are better for grinding than others. These are usually upbeat, energetic songs instead of slow dance songs. No matter how you grind, keeping to the beat helps you dance better.

, Many front grind moves are less intimate than grinds from behind and are good when you or your partner don’t want to get too close. Face your partner. Flex your back so that your chest bumps into theirs. Move your body backwards and repeat., Stand face to face with your partner. Start by sticking your chest forward as you would in a bump. Let the rest of your body move forward gradually all the way down to your pelvis like a wave is running through you, then repeat the move., Hip rolls are similar to back grinding, except you face your partner. Move one side of your hips forward towards your partner. Roll your hips in a circular motion to the other side, back, and around., Wait until they turn around and start dancing with you. Grind dancing is sensual, so putting your hands on your partner’s hips is often a good move, but you need to make sure first that they’re okay with this.


Leave your hands on their hips and go no further. Don’t assume that this is anything more than a dance. Unwanted touching is still inappropriate.

, Bend your knees slightly and sway side to side at first. Follow your partner’s lead. Often, grinding starts by both you and your partner moving in circles. Keep your knees bent as you move your waist around in a circle.

, If you’re dancing with a stranger, they may not be comfortable with full-on contact. One way to grind in spite of this is to lean. Stand directly behind your partner. Lean in the opposite direction they lean, then dance as usual.You’ll know your partner is uncomfortable if they seem hesitant or pull away from you. It’s better in this case to lean away or move back a little so you apply less pressure.

, A normal grind dance is about being close to your partner. Get close enough to them while dancing so that your hips press against theirs. The more comfortable your partner is with you on the dance floor, the more willing they will likely be to increase this contact. Allow them to take the lead if you’re unsure if you should press more.

, It wouldn’t be very fun if you stood there and moved your hips in a circle for an entire song. To make the dance better, try changing your moves. Stay close to your partner but add in a move such as dipping from one side to the other. Use your hands to help guide your partner’s hips.

Start dancing with your girlfriends.,
Move closer to the guy.,
Start ""accidentally"" brushing up against the guy.,
Step in front of the guy.",How to Grind (for Girls)1," Unless you already know the guy you want to dance with and he's led you to the dance floor, you'll have to approach the dance floor on your own first. (If you already have a guy, then you can skip this section). Take a trusted girlfriend or two with you and have a great time dancing, doing your own thing, and going a little crazy.Don't look around like you're desperate for a guy to dance with, even if you've found your target -- instead, let the guys see what a great time you're having and they'll come to you.
Show off your dance moves with your girlfriends. Let the guys see that you can work your body, follow the beat, and have a great time.;
, Once you've found your guy -- and maybe even locked eyes with him from across the room -- you and your girlfriends should start moving closer to him. Make this a natural, gradual move, and wait for him to come closer to you, too. If you lock eyes from across the room for one second and then one inch away from him the next, you won't look cool.


Make your way over to him during the course of a song.
Make sure that your girlfriends follow without crowding the guy.

, At this point, you should lock eyes with the guy, and maybe even give him a cute smile and then look away. Then, move even closer to him and let your body brush up against his, whether you're facing him and touching him with your hands, or turning away form him and occasionally brushing up against him with your desire., Show him what you've got by stepping in front of him so that you lock eyes and know you're going to dance with each other. Spend a minute dancing in front of him, moving to the beat, and then slowly begin to turn so he can start dancing behind you and you can officially begin to grind.

Step in front of the guy, facing away from him.,
Bend your knees.,
Move your hips and butt.,
Move your arms and chest.",How to Grind (for Girls)2," First, you have to get in grinding position. Though you can mix it up once in a while, typical grinding position is when a guy stands behind a girl. You can leave about a foot between your bodies and don't have to get incredibly intimate to start grinding with the guy -- especially if you don't know him.

, Both you and the guy should bend your knees so that you're lower to the ground. If the guy is much taller than you, then you won't have to bend your knees very much. If the guy isn't much taller than you, however -- this is likely to happen if you're wearing high heels -- then you should bend your knees a bit further so he's a bit above you.

, Now, move your hips and butt in one continuous circular motion, continuing to move from side to side while moving your legs up and down just a bit while keeping your knees bent. If the guy knows what he's doing, then his hips should find a similar rhythm to yours -- your hips should move in the same direction to the beat of the music.









If you're feeling bold, you can touch the guy's front side with your butt as you move it from side to side. But you can also maintain a distance away from the guy.

, Move your arms and chest to the beat of the music, gyrating your arms and chest in the same fluid motion. Look ahead or slightly down as you continue to work your arms and chest while you move your hips. You can bring your arms down so they're on your knees or near your waist, and wait for the guys hands to land on top of yours or around your waist as you continue to dance.








"
"
Move from side to side.,
Turn it around.,
Touch the floor.,
Do the slow grind.",How to Grind (for Girls)3," You don't have to dance right in front of the guy the whole time -- that can get boring, and you may actually want to see your dance partner once in a while. So, you can move over to the left, continuing your circular motion and bent knees motion, while the guy moves to the right, so you can look up and see him. You can switch places and move to the right while he moves to the left, and keep moving back and forth.

, Turn around to face the guy instead of turning your back to him, and place your arms around his neck. This is called front grinding -- it's more risky and more sexy. Let him put his hands on your hips as you continue to move your waist in a circular motion. Move your hands away from his neck, and up and down his chest. Then, turn back around again.


You can even place your fingers in the guy's belt loops for a few seconds.

, When your back is to the guy, you can move your hands all the way down to the floor or near it, as you raise your butt more and more in the air. This is a more intimate move that is sure to make the guy go crazy -- as long as you have the confidence to pull it off.

, Don't be intimidated if a slower song comes on at the club. You can still grind more slowly to the music, using the same moves you used to grind to fast-paced music, just at a lower speed. The slow grind is even sexier if you can pull it off. Don't let the guy see that you've been thrown off -- just continue to move to the music without skipping a beat.

Men who moved their heads, necks, and upper bodies in a fluid manner, following the rhythm of the music, were ranked as more sexual appealing by a group of female judges. If you're a man, remember to keep these body parts in mind when dancing. It could make you appear more attractive to women. Bob your head from side to side. Sway your upper body with the movement., If you want to practice dirty dancing, learn some basic moves. Having a few specific moves in mind may be better than simply improvising.


Learn the basic rhythmic step. Step right, then bring the right foot together with the left. Then step left and bring the left foot together with the right.
Practice a basic dirty dancing hold. The man places his right hip so it's glued to the woman's right hip. Then, the man takes his right leg and places it between her legs. The woman wraps her hand around the man's neck and the man places his hands on the woman's hips.
The basic dirty dancing dip involves one partner wrapping his or her arms around the other partner's neck. Then, this partner bends over while the other partner reaches one leg upward.

, Bend your knees a little bit. Rock your hips from side to side, swinging your behind down toward the floor as you sway.You can spice this movement up by rotating your pelvis in a circle as you swing your hips from side to side. Imagine it like you're moving a hula hoop with your hips. You can put your hands on your hips or move them in the air with the beat of the music., Grinding is a popular dirty dancing move that involves rubbing your hips on the groin area of someone dancing behind you. Keep your feet hip-width apart and gently bend over. Keep your back arched so your behind sticks up into the air. Then, wiggle your hips gently against your dance partner's groin. If you're doing a lap dance, rise and fall against your partner's lap while wiggling your hips., Hold most of your body still while you move a only certain part.For example, you might stand close to your partner and stay still except for rocking your hips or locking your knees.


You can also work on contrasts, such as making a fast spin end in a slow caress or carrying a hip sway all the way to the ground.

, Touching your partner's body can help enhance the experience of dirty dancing. Rub your hands gently over your partner's legs, back, and sides. Try touching your partner's face in a slow, sensual manner. You can also wrap one leg around your partner's side, although this may be slightly more complicated.

, Do not just focus on touching your partner's body when dirty dancing. Engaging with your own body can be sexually appealing as well.


Engage with your lower body. Run your hands up and down your legs, touching your knees and upper calves. Touch or slap your butt. Have fun and do what feels comfortable.For the upper body, touching the shoulders or running your fingers through your hair can be sexy. For women, you can try touching your breasts., Some people are attracted to those who can dance well. Try to pay attention to the beat of the music you're dancing to. Move your body with the beat of the music. Try to have your movements follow the song. Dance faster for a quicker paced moment in a song. Slow down as the tempo does. Having a stylized routine is something many people might find appealing., If you want to be good at dancing dirty, it's like any other skill. It requires a great deal of practice. Strive to spend some time each day practicing a dance routine.


If you need inspiration for dance moves, there are many tutorials on YouTube and other video sharing sites that go over sexy dance moves. Try practicing some of these routines in front of the mirror.

, If you want to be a good dancer, try to forget insecurity. Do not get hung up on what others might think. Focus on yourself and your body. In clubs and other places where people dance publicly, you may occasionally get a rude comment. Try to ignore negativity. It usually comes from a place of insecurity., Having a positive body image can help you be more comfortable with yourself. This can help you feel better about dirty dancing Work on building a strong body image.


Focus on the function of your body over its form. Instead of feeling bad about your weight, physique, and other aspects of your physical appearance, focus on how strong your body is. Allow yourself to be amazed that you can bike to work uphill. Embrace the fact you're able to keep up with friends on a weekend hike.Practice positive self-talk. Spend some time talking up your body each day. Say to yourself, ""I love my arms"" or ""I enjoy how my legs look these days."" It may sound strange at first, but praising your body can help you feel better and more confident.Get rid of things that trigger a poor body image. Ditch the bathroom scale. Don't go out to lunch with people who are dieting or complain about their own bodies. Avoid mirrors if you tend to scrutinize yourself., There are many classes you can take on dancing, dirty dancing in particular. Look for classes in your area. If you're female, a pole dancing class might actually be helpful. Many women find such classes surprisingly empowering and welcome to women of all shapes and sizes. You could also look for a belly dance class or an erotic dancing class.

, Look for clothing that is sexy and form fitting. However, make sure you can still move in the clothing. Pants that are too tight, for example, can be constricting when dirty dancing. Choose provocative, revealing clothes that are loose enough that you can move in them.

Take dance classes.,
Move to the music.,
Wear booty enhancing clothes.,
Be confident.",How to Booty Bounce1," The best place to learn how to booty bounce is by visiting a dance class. There are so many genres of dance that incorporate swaying your hips and bouncing your butt for sexy movements. Some dance classes to consider taking are:Salsa: In this dance style you'll be swaying your hips a lot, but occasionally you can do up a booty bounce.

Hip hop: This is probably the style of dance that you will booty bounce in the most often. Hip hop involves getting low to the floor, and moving to the beat of the music. While hip hopping you can pop, lock, and drop it or do the twerk to incorporate that booty bounce.
Zumba: This is the perfect dance class to take if you want to exercise and move your booty. Zumba combines latin dancing with other styles so you can sway, pump, and move your booty to the music.;
, If you want to booty bounce and feel comfortable and confident at the same time, you need great music. If you are in a club or just at home practicing, put on some soulful music, or music that you can easily dance to. Then, move to the music, feeling the rhythm in your body. Practice shaking and bouncing your butt in different ways. Do the twerk, or experiment with other body movements.Bouncing your booty is really all about doing what feels good. The best way to bounce your booty is to get in a position where you are lower to the ground and your knees are bent. Then you'll have more movement in your booty and it will pop out more.

, To really draw attention to your butt, you need to wear clothes that accentuate your booty. Choose some tight, high waisted jeans to really round out your behind. Or wear some cut off shorts to show off your legs. Wear what feels comfortable to you, and what is easiest to dance in.You can also buy booty enhancing clothes like booty pop shorts, which add extra padding to your butt area. A tight dress or skirt can also enhance your booty by making your waist look smaller and your butt look bigger.
Some things you might avoid are looser pants, longer skirts, or flowy dresses. These outfits are cute, but they won't cling to your butt and so your booty bounce will be less noticeable. If you just want to dance and shake your butt and don't care about people noticing, then wear whatever you want.

, One of the most important things to remember when booty bouncing is to be confident. If you look insecure about your booty dancing, people will notice and you won't be able to pull off a really good bounce. Whether you have a small behind or round booty, don't be afraid to shake it. Don't compare you booty to other people's booties. As the saying goes just ""shake what your momma gave you."""
"
Spread your legs apart.,
Bend in a squat.,
Arch your back.,
Straighten or round your back.,
Accent your behind.,
Practice with some music.",How to Booty Bounce2," Before you start bouncing your booty, you'll want to get in the right position. Start off by standing with your legs apart, wider than your hips. If you want to get lower to the ground, you can spread your legs about three feet apart. Make sure you don't spread your legs out too far, as you won't be able to do the proper booty bounce. Keeping them too close together, though, will make it harder for you to go lower to the ground. If you aren't sure how far to spread them, stand with your feet together and then jump your legs out at a comfortable position. If you feel a stretch in your inner thighs, you might have jumped your legs out too far.

, Now that your legs are spread apart, bend your knees so you are in somewhat of a squat position. If you can go lower, then go lower. If not, squat to a position that is comfortable and easy to stay in. Place your hands on the top of your thighs with your fingers turned towards each other. Lean your upper body over just a bit, so that your chest is over your knees, but keep it popped out.In this position, you want to make sure your chest, shoulders, and neck are not hunched over. You don't want to look defeated, but you want to look comfortable and chill. Try to keep your shoulders back and your head up.

, You have your position so you can begin to do the moves for a twerking booty bounce. Remaining in your position, arch your back, so that your chest pokes out even more. This will push your shoulders back and if you were to look at your back from the side it should form a small scoop.As you arch your back, your butt should pop out and perk up somewhat. If it's not doing this, you may need to arch your back some more or get lower to the ground. Also, your butt size will determine how much your booty pops out. In this move, you are getting down in a lower squat.

, Take your arching back and pull it back to round it somewhat so that your shoulders come forward and your chest comes in. You don't want to hunch over, but you also don't want perfect posture here, so just relax your back to what feels comfortable. Then, rotate from arching your back to rounding your back at a quick pace, going back and forth from one move to the other.To arch your back, imagine someone is pulling a string attached to your lower back, causing your back to be rounded instead of arched. Your main focus should be on rounding out that part of your back, first. You don't want to just hunch over and round out your shoulders. You're also lifting yourself up a little bit. When you are in the arch you should be in a low squat, but when you round out your back, your squat will lift up.
To get the beat of this move, as you are practicing say the words ""arch"" as you arch your back and then ""drop"" as you straighten out your back. Essentially when you arch your back your butt is perking up and popping out. Then, when you round and straighten your back you're kind of dropping your shoulders and your butt so that it bounces back to a relaxed position. In this move, your squat should be higher than it was when you were arching your back.

, There are two ways to do the previous move described. Now that you have practiced generally popping out your booty, you can begin to really draw attention to your booty bounce. The two ways to move your booty in this move are:Booty up bounce: As you are arching your back, pop your booty up. Before, it may have popped up naturally, but now you really want to put movement in your booty. Imagine something is pulling your booty up by a string. Try to lift it upwards as much as you can. When you arch your back, this move will require more force from your booty. Instead of having our booty poke out on its own, you are going push it out. As you are practicing, every time you arch your back say ""up."" Then, try to do five in a row, saying ""up, up, up, up, up.""
Booty down bounce: As you are relaxing your back and rounding it out think about bouncing your booty down. Instead of focusing on the booty bounce when you are arching your back, focus on the bounce when you are relaxed. Think about pulling your booty down every time you relax your back. When you pull your booty down you should be squeezing your booty and this should also cause your butt to round out as if it's curling under. Try five in a row saying ""down, down, down, down, down.""

, Now that you know the moves, you can practice them with some music. Choose some fast paced music you can dance to and twerk your booty, making it bounce up and then bouncing it down. If one feels more comfortable for you, then do that one most of the time.

Adjust your weight.,
Target your glutes.,
Strengthen your legs.,
Tone your butt.",How to Booty Bounce3," Booty bouncing can really depend on the type of booty you have. Bigger booties may be the easiest to bounce, but smaller butts can still be bounced too. However, toning up your booty or changing your diet can always be helpful because you will have more muscle to bounce rather than fat. Fat may jiggle better than muscle, but muscle will look sexier and more sensual.Toning your butt will also give you more endurance when booty bouncing. Because booty bouncing often involves some form of squatting, toning up your legs and butt muscles will help you squat for longer, thus allowing you to booty bounce all night long.
If you want to make your butt look bigger, you can exercise but you may also try eating more. If you are exercising, you will likely be burning more calories, so your body will need more calories in order to keep up. If you already have a big booty and want to tone it up for a better bounce, consider cutting some calories out of your diet and eating more fruits, vegetables, and protein. Also, make sure to drink lots of water!If you are trying to gain more booty, focus on strength training. If you are trying to lose booty, focus on cardio.

, There are many ways to tone your glutes, but one really effective way is by doing a glute bridge. Lie down on your back and place your feet on the floor about a foot away from your butt with your knees bent. Slowly lift up your butt from the ground until your knees and thighs make a straight line. Then, lower back to the ground and repeat.For the most effective workout, do this to an entire song. Your butt and glutes are going to burn, but it will really help strengthen and build the muscles in that area, resulting in a bigger looking booty.

, One of the most obvious ways to build up your leg and inner thigh muscles is by doing squats. Since that's a big part of booty bouncing, squats are the perfect exercise for you. Place your feet hip width apart and bend your knees while lowering your butt to the ground. Go as low as you can while still keeping your back straight and upper body lifted. Then, lift yourself back up and repeat.To target more of your inner thighs, place your legs farther apart and do plié or sumo squats. This will still work out your legs, but will really target your booty, glutes, and inner thighs.

, Some of the best butt exercises are donkey kicks and fire hydrants. Get on your hands and knees, and lift one leg up, with your foot towards the ceiling and your knee bent at a 90 degree angle. Then, pulse that leg up for 12 reps and repeat with the other leg. If you can, try to do three sets of 12 reps on each leg, or do each leg for one minute at a time.For a fire hydrant, stay in the same position, but lift your leg out to the side, with your knee bent (imagine you are a dog relieving himself on a fire hydrant). Then, bring your leg back in, keeping your knee bent, and lift it back out again. Do 12 reps and repeat on the other side.

Claim your pole.,
Dress appropriately.,
Avoid body oil or lotion.,
Stretch.",How to Learn Pole Dancing1," More and more gyms are offering pole dancing classes as a creative way to get fit. Call yours to see if they offer one. You can also find out if fitness center chains that are known to offer pole dancing classes are in your area. Many independent teachers offer pole dancing classes in local gyms and halls too, so it's worth checking to see if anyone offers lessons near you. If you can't find anyone to teach you this challenging activity, then you can even buy a pole to install at home.


If you want to pole dance in the comforts of your own home, then you should get a free-standing pole that you can install in your home after carefully following the instructions. The pole should be completely fitted to your ceiling and floor and should be secured in a place that gives you lots of space to move around.;
, As you prepare to pole dance, you should wear comfortable clothes that expose your arms and legs. Sexiness is optional. Baring your skin will allow you to get a much better grip on the pole with your arms and legs so that you can perform these moves safely. For even better foot grips, try going barefoot. You can wear heels if you're comfortable with the pole and want to feel sexy, or some trainers to get a good drip on the pole.

, Avoid putting any oils or lotions on your body before you begin to pole dance. This will make you slide from the pole and can even be dangerous. You can even wipe down the pole before you use it to get rid of any oils or grease.

, Just as you would before any other form of exercise, you should do some light stretching and warming up before you begin to pole dance. Stand straight and then bend down to touch your toes, roll your neck and shoulders, and stretch your hamstrings by pulling one foot back with your toes touching your butt until you feel a nice stretch on each hamstring.


Pull back your fingers with your palms facing away from you to stretch your wrists. Your fingers and wrists will need to be warmed up to grip the pole.

"
"
Grab the pole.,
Step around.,
Hook the pole with your leg.,
Arch your body.,
Straighten up.",How to Learn Pole Dancing2," Start at the back of the pole, with your inside foot close to the base of the pole. Use your dominant hand to grab the pole at about head height. Allow your arm to straighten, so your weight is hanging away from the pole.

, Keeping your outside leg straight and swing it out to the side and step all the way around the pole, pivoting on your inside foot at the same time. Allow your knee to bend slightly as you turn to make the movement more graceful.

, Place your outside foot down just behind the other foot. Transfer your weight to the back foot and hook your inside leg around the front of the pole, getting a good grip right behind the knee.

, To finish off, arch your body backwards, lowering your hand to allow for a deeper arch. This is where flexibility comes in. Arch your back only as far as you feel comfortable and make sure that you have a good grip with your leg and your hand. You can tie your hair up or let it fall behind you if it makes you feel sexier.

, Straighten your body and your leg down from the pole and prepare to do the next move. The basic wrap-around move is a perfect move for beginners of pole dancing and is a great transition to more complicated moves.

"
"
Face the pole.,
Wrap your leg around the pole.,
Wrap your other leg around the pole.,
Move your hands up.,
Pull your knees up.,
Squeeze the pole with your legs and straighten up.,
Repeat these steps until you're done climbing.,
Come down.",How to Learn Pole Dancing3," The first step to doing the basic climb is simply to stand about a foot away from the pole while facing it. Hold on to the pole with one hand., Bring up the leg on the same side of your body as the hand that is holding the pole. Then, bring your leg up to the pole as you wrap your other hand around it. Flex your foot and place it on one side of the pole, with your knee on the other side. You'll need to use this leg to really anchor yourself to the pole and create a sturdy base for your other foot to land on.

, Now, pull your body up with your hands. Swing your free leg around and hook the back of the foot behind the first foot, and place the knee of the leg only the pole, so you have a firm grip on the pole with both of your knees. These two legs will now create a platform for you to use as you climb the pole.

, Move your hands about one foot up the pole to give yourself room to straighten out.

, Use your abdominal muscle to pull up your knees about one to two feet.

, After you bend your knees, you should lean back a bit and then squeeze the pole with the muscles of your legs and use them to straighten your body as your hands move up the pole.

, Repeat these steps a few more times until you've reached the top of your pole or the end of your comfort level. This plan will help you climb the pole while getting a great workout and looking sexy in the process.

, You can either slide down using the basic fireman slide, or you can hold on to the pole with your hands and release your legs just for a moment, bringing them out in front of you and rocking your hips as you move your legs down to the ground. This method will take a bit longer to master but it will look sexy and will look and feel fantastic.

"
"
Grab the pole with both hands.,
Swing around the pole.,
Spring up on the pole.,
Spin.,
Stand tall.",How to Learn Pole Dancing4," Stand next to the pole so that it's closer to your weaker side. Then, place both of your hands on the pole so you're gripping it like a baseball bat, with your hands a bit more than a foot apart. The hand closest to the pole should be on top and the hand on your outside should be on the bottom. Your lower hand should be at about eye level.

, Take one step with the foot closer to the pole and swing the leg on the outside around the pole to get your momentum going. This will give you enough speed and power to comfortably swing around the pole.

, Pull up on the pole with your hands so your arms are supporting the entire weight of your body for a second. As you do this, jump off on your inside foot and grab onto the pole with both of your knees. Make sure you have a firm grip on the pole so you don't slide off.

, Continue to hold onto the pole with your hands and knees as you spin down around the pole until you land on both feet. The higher your arms are positioned on the pole originally, the longer you'll spin before you reach the ground.

, Once you've landed, just move your hips back and get back into a standing position.

"
"
Do the body wave.,
Do the backwards wiggle.,
Wiggle down the pole.",How to Learn Pole Dancing5," This is the perfect standing transitional move between any spinning or climbing moves. To do the body wave, just stand facing the pole and grab it with your dominant hand. Your knees should be slightly bent and your feet should be positioned on either side of the pole, so that your torso is about a foot away from the pole and your feet are comfortably spread apart.


First, push your chest forward toward the pole, then push your hips back, and then push your shoulders back, and then push your hips forward again and repeat this movement. The body wave should look like one fluid motion instead of a series of moves.

, To do this sexy move, start by standing straight up with your back against the pole. Reach up behind your head to grab the pole with both hands. Then, gyrate your hips from side to side as you slide down the pole until you're crouching. As you do this, run your hands down the front of your body all the way to your knees.


Then, push your knees apart so that your legs are momentarily spread and then quickly pop back up into a standing position.

, For this type of gyrating movement, you should stand facing the pole with your feet on either side of it at a comfortable distance. Grip the pole with your dominant hand just below the height of your head. Then, gyrate your hips from side to side as you slide down the pole until you're crouching. Once you're crouching, push your hips back and raise your body up until your upper body uncurls into a standing position.

Pick the right music.,
Get your grounding.,
Know how to stop and start.,
Learn to freeze.,
Practice your robotic expression.",How to Do the Robot1," The robot should be done in pace with the music, so music with distinct beats, such as Electro-Funk, is perfect for this dance. But there are other popular songs that aren't necessarily suited for this dance, but have been used to perform the Robot before. Once you've chosen your song, you can play it as you learn the basics, so you get used to dancing to the rhythm of the song. Try one of these or find your own:









Styx's ""Mr. Roboto""
Jackson 5's ""Dancing Machine""
Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean""
Timbaland's ""Bounce""
Daft Punk's ""Around the World""
Kraftwerk's ""The Robots""
Jonathan Coulton/GLaDOS ""Still Alive""
Bender & The Robot Devil ""Robot Hell Song"";
, Work on lifting your shoulders up, and sinking them down abruptly. You will do a more subtle version of this move as you move up and down or left to right, so get used to the feeling of lifting your shoulders and then lowering them below their natural positions -- like an exaggerated shrug.








, To master this trick, just move your body in one direction, abruptly stop, jerking your body into that position -- this is called ""freeze busting"" your body into a new pose. This is when jerking your shoulders downward will come in handy. Then, move in another direction and repeat this motion: move, jerk your body to a stop, and then move in another direction and do it again.









Stop and start your body naturally to the beat of the music. If the song is a bit slower, then you should stop and start less often.

, Now, practice the stop and start again, but when you stop, hold the position for a bit longer -- up to two or three seconds, depending on the beat of the music. You should not only freeze your body, but also freeze the expression on your face.








, The robot's face should look vacant and empty -- robots don't show emotion. However, you can try looking a bit crazed or bewildered, like you're surprised or have been programmed to move around and do the dance. Pretend you were sleeping and someone suddenly threw you onto the dance floor. Just don't smile or nod at the crowd, or that will break character.

Listen for the right music.,
Find your partner.,
Get into position.,
Move your hips in the same circular motion.,
The guy should put his hands on the girl's hips.,
Get low.,
Grind in a group.,
Do the side-to-side grind.,
Grind while facing your partner.,
Master the slow grind.",How to Grind," While you're waiting for some hip-hop or house music to come on, scout the dance floor for some partners that you might want to grind with. You don't want to get to the dance floor in the middle of a slow song and miss your chance to grind. You can either way to go up to someone, or just go to the dance floor with your friends, and get ready to mingle.;
, If you're brave, you can go up to a potential partner and ask, ""Hey you want to dance?"" But if you want to be more slick about it, just rock out on the dance floor until someone special catches your eye. Then, you can nod and smile at the person as you come dance closer and closer to each other until you're brushing up against each other. Just don't come up to a complete stranger without making eye contact, or you'll be brushed off.

, Usually, the guy gets behind the girl to start grinding. However, you can always grind face-to-face. Then, the girl should slowly turn away from the guy until she's dancing with her back to him. The guy should be behind the girl, at a respectable distance, but close enough to put his hands on her hips or sides when the time is right.


Standing about a foot away from the guy at first is about the right distance. You can move closer together as you get more comfortable.

, While normally the guy is behind the girl, feel free to switch things up. The girl's hips should move in a circular motion, and the guy's hips should match that motion. Before the guy puts his hands all over the girl, the dancing pair, or trio, should find a comfortable rhythm.


If you're in front, move your booty around in a pattern at around the crotch level of your partner. You're in control.
If you're behind someone else, follow her movements. Your pelvises can be directly aligned or slightly off so that of your legs is between your partner's legs.

, Once you found a comfortable flow, the guy should put his hands on the girl's hips. He doesn't have to grip them too firmly -- just enough to gain his footing and to settle deeper into the grind. The girl can bend her knees, so the couple can move lower to the ground.


As the girl gets low, her hands can travel down her thighs and even to her knees.
The girl can keep her arms loose. She can move them up and down to the beat of the music while grazing her own thighs or knees.

, Guys should expect a booty shake, and girls should expect to shake their booties. Gradually, a girl will get lower to the ground, putting her hands on her knees, or holding the guy's hands near her waist. As she leans forward, her backside will raise in the air, brushing up or hovering near her dance partner.


The guy's hands can travel up from the girl's hips to below her waist, at the top of her backside. This will work as long as the guy is respectful and the girl is comfortable with this movement.
If you're up for it, the girl can get even lower to the ground until her hands are nearly touching or touching the floor and her booty is raised high.

, Sometimes a group of people start grinding together in a chain. Usually, you'll see either a mix of men and women alternating or just women. Sometimes two women will ""sandwich"" a man, and others will latch on. Don't hesitate to go with whatever makes you feel good.


Grinding in a group can be even more fun than grinding with just one partner, but it will require more coordination. If one person in the group bends down, everyone else will have to adjust accordingly.

, Dancing the same exact way can get old after a while, so once you and your partner have been grinding the traditional way for a while, go for the side-to-side move. This way, the girl moves to the left while the guy moves to the right, so they're always on opposite sides. Though you'll still be turned away from your partner, you can look up or down at him or her during this move.

, Don't be afraid to turn toward your partner and grind while facing him or her. The girl can put her arms around the guy's neck while he keeps his hands on her hips and both people continue to move their hips in a circular rhythm. You don't have to stay facing your partner, either. You can mix it up by turning around and then turning back toward your partner whenever you want a change.

, You don't have to rush off the dance floor if a slow song comes on. If you're comfortable with your partner and having a good time, there's no need to stop the fun. Just keep doing what you're doing -- only slower and sexier. Don't skip a beat. Just transition right into the slower dance move. If you hesitate, your partner may think you don't know what to do.

Imagine that you are hula hooping. Move your hips as though you were trying to keep the hula hoop in place, and then slow this motion down slightly. If you want, use an actual hula hoop to practice moving your hips. This will help you to isolate the motion and become comfortable with it.
Keep your weight on the balls of your feet while you are dancing. Doing this will give you greater control over your hip movements.
Bend your knees slightly inward and roll to the insides of your feet. This gives you a larger range of hip motion.
Don’t forget to straighten your leg. When you are circling or swinging your hips, alternate which leg is bent and which is straight. This exaggerates your hip motions.
Change speeds. When you are moving your hips, focus on doing a few hip circles slowly and then a few at double speed. This will give a visual variety to your dancing.
Remember that hip movements are important for both men and women. Think about Elvis. He was one of the first people to popularize hip shaking as a new, sexy dance.If you want to get even raunchier and stand out, you can try popular sexy dances like twerking, which involves bending over to shake your hips and backside.;
, Even though sexy dancing emphasizes the body, you want to make sure your arms don’t look awkward or stiff and ruin the effect of your other movements.


Pick a position. For sexy dancing in a club setting, you should put your arms in one of four positions: above your head, behind your head, at the level of your chest, or by your side.
No matter which of these positions your arms are in, they should have a slight bend at the elbow.
If your hands are behind your head, you should bend your elbows more sharply and rest your hands on your hand.
Hold your hands in a relaxed, almost closed position. It should be like you are about to create a fist.
If you want to show off your chest, keep your arms slightly behind your body.
Gently move your arms back and forth to the music. This doesn’t have to be a drastic movement, just enough not to draw attention to them.
You can also periodically run your hands along the sides of your body to accentuate body rolls or sexily run them through your hair.

, Expression is the icing on the cake that makes your dancing truly sexy and appealing to others. Work on your facial expression by practicing with a large mirror.


Smile with your eyes.To see what this looks like, smile widely and then cover your mouth with your hand. Look in the mirror to study what your eyes look like. Make sure there is no tension in your forehead.
Also, lose the tension in your jaw. You want to hold your mouth slightly parted in a comfortable pout. The edges of your mouth should be just barely upturned.
As you are dancing, occasionally make eye contact with people you find attractive, and then after a few seconds, cast your eyes down and look away but keep dancing. This makes you seems mysterious and desirable.
Keep your head loose. Allow your neck to move to the music but don’t think you need to move it around too much.

, A large part of sexy dancing in public places is dancing with other people. As you are dancing, gauge how the other person is responding to you.


Move incrementally closer. Dance as if you are unaware of anything but your dancing, while moving closer to the person you want to dance with. Move one step at a time.
Try to make eye contact. If the person returns this contact or smiles at you, keep moving closer.
Begin to brush up against this person slightly as you are dancing. If they don’t move away, begin to grind against them more intentionally.
If you are behind your partner, lightly place your hands on their hips as you dance.
If you are grinding in front, keep your arms next to you or reach up behind you and put them around your partners neck.

, Dancing is a lot like a puzzle, a series of small moves that flow together to make something awesome. Have a few great puzzle pieces up your sleeve that you feel comfortable doing.


Focus on your assets. Think about which parts of your body you want to accentuate. For example, if you want to accentuate your rear, you’ll want to focus especially on large hip movements.
Practice your expression, and decide where you like to hold your arms when you dance.

, Even if it's not the kind of dancing you'll do at a party or a club, learning a specific kind of sexy ballroom dance will give you some moves you can transfer into other situations.More importantly, it'll give you a boost of confidence and coordination.


Some sexy dances include the tango, samba and salsa from Latin America or belly dancing, of Middle Eastern origins.
Use dance DVDs and online resources.This way, you can watch the routines and decide what you’d like to learn.
Take a class. When it comes to dancing, there’s nothing quite like dancing with an instructor to correct you. If you take a class, you will be able to practice your partnering skills with your peers.
If you want to take a class, try sites like Groupon, which often offers local discounts on class passes.Check the calendar sections of local community papers. Often, these will list free or inexpensive dance classes at local community centers, restaurants, or bars.

, When you’re learning how to dance sexily, music matters. Make yourself a list of songs with a good beat and sexy lyrics.Pick songs you love, and you’ll be more likely to stick to practicing.


Sexy songs can be either fast or slow in tempo.For club style music, listen for a steady, loud drum beat in the background of the music that makes you want to tap your foot. Listen to pop artists like Beyoncé or techno remixes.
For more sensual music, listen to jazz standards with vocals or R&B artists.
Listen for lyrics. Pick songs with a good beat, but also try to pick songs that have a romantic or sexual theme.
If you want to do a Latin style of dancing, listen to Spanish pop music. If you don’t speak Spanish, the foreign language can make it seem even more exotic.
If you don’t want to create your own mix, you can find premade club playlists on music platforms like Spotify or LastFM.

, Like any skill, becoming a good dancer takes consistency. Make it a habitual part of your every day routine.Start at a set time each day, and commit to spending 20 minutes dancing by yourself.
Make your playlist exactly 20 minutes long. That way, you’ll know when you’re done by the music, and you won’t have to time yourself.
Listening to the same playlist every time you practice can help make you more comfortable dancing sexily.

, Even when you’re practicing on your own, it’s difficult to get in a sexy mindset in a bland setting. Jazz up your space.Close your door, dim your lights, and light a few candles. Try stringing up some small twinkle lights to add ambiance. Swipe on some lipstick, if you want.
Use the best sound system you have. If you’re practicing in a place where people can hear, try using headphones and a small music player instead. You want the music to be loud but not blaring.
Get carried away. When you first begin to practice, don’t worry about specific moves or how you look. Just let yourself get carried away in the music. Closing your eyes at first can help you relax, forget where you are, and not worry about what you look like.
It is important to focus on losing your self-consciousness.This is the barrier that keeps most people from trying to dance. As you are dancing, try focus on the lyrics of each song. This will help keep away any negative self-talk by giving you something to focus on while you move.
Remember that you’re your biggest critic. If you work on letting go while you practice, it will be easier to let go in a social setting.

, If you feel great about your body, you’ll feel sexier, and you’ll be able to keep up on the dance floor.


Try doing workouts at home specifically designed to help you become a better dancer, like a ballet bar routine or a yoga class.
If you don’t have time for a full work out, try just doing a few squats, push ups, and sit ups right when you get up in the morning.

, Before you go out dancing, choose the right outfit. You want to wear something that accentuates your best features but doesn’t make you uncomfortable.


Choose a favorite outfit. It can be tempting to wear a new dress, skirt, or pants on a night out, but try to wear something you’ve worn a lot and know you’ll be comfortable in. You don’t want to be worrying about your clothes while you are dancing.
Wear black. Black is a great go-to color for anyone and any body type, whether you’re a man or a woman.It will make you feel put together and suave and will ease your self-consciousness.
You can dress it up with statement jewelry and bright shoes.
Ladies, consider wearing flats. If you love heels, wear them, but don’t feel like you have to. Cute flats can make the different between staying on the dance floor and sitting out dances.
If you’re a man, think about switching up your shoes. Instead of dress shoes, wear cool sneakers like Vans or Converse. They will be more comfortable and give you a casual, fun look.

, You want to look flawless and put together on your night out. As you are getting ready, allot more time than usual to take a shower and clean up.


Trim any facial hair.
Shave and moisturize, if you want.
Brush your hair, and style it. Keep it in place with some hair spray.
Put on a splash of your favorite cologne or perfume.
If you normally wear makeup, try a smoky eye or add a bold color to your lips.Remember, you want to look like a sexier version of yourself, not a completely different person.

, Having a bit of fun before you go dancing can help put you in the right mindset.


Listen to upbeat music that you love, and move while you get ready, even if it’s just dancing from your chair while you do your hair.
If you’re of legal age, have a drink. A drink or two before you go out can give you that little extra confidence boost you need to just let go and have fun.

, If you get ready to go out by yourself, it can be easy to get nervous about trying to be sexy.


Your friends will tell you how great you look, and give you tips on your outfit.
Having friends around will also help you to relax and just have a good time.

, If you're nervous about what people will think of you, consider just taking one friend and going to a place outside of your usual sphere so that the people you're dancing around are mostly people you don't know.


In a new crowd, no one will find it strange that you’re dancing sexily.
A change in setting can help you feel free to change up your style and let yourself go.

, As you dance, make eye contact with people you find attractive. If they approach you, get slightly closer to them.


If no one, asks you to dance, ask them. Even if you’re shy, you’ll be glad you did.Mirror the movements of the person you’re dancing with. Try to react to how they’re moving so that you are in sync with them.
Don’t be afraid to put your hands around their neck and dance up close and personal. However, if you don’t want to dance with someone, you can always say no thank you and move away.

, Good dancing rises from the heart.Let rhythm guide your movements.


If you don’t like a song or can’t hear the beat, don’t feel like you have to dance. You’ll feel more confident dancing to songs that you like.

, More than anything, relaxation is key to feeling––and looking––sexy on the dance floor. Slow down, relax, and let your body move to the music.

, When dancing, be aware of others around you. Most places may be packed but that shouldn't stop you from dancing sexily. Try not to bump into others unintentionally.


When you’re dancing with a partner, keep track of how they are dancing, and where their feet and arms are.
Try to slip your hands around your partner’s waist or neck.

, If you dance like yourself, you’re bound to look sexy. Above all, remember that you want to have a good time. Even if you feel a little awkward, smile. If you make a small mistake or trip, laugh out loud about it. The ability to laugh at yourself makes you sexier.


A happy face and genuine laughter also makes you much more approachable to people that might want to dance with you.
However, don’t go over the top. Be sincere in your dancing, and imitate if you want to. If you see someone across the dance floor dancing really well, feel free to try imitating some of their moves.

Move your head to the left.,
Bend down.,
Wave your right robot arm.,
Slowly straighten your back.,
Pop open.,
Wave your left robot arm.,
Move around.",How to Do the Robot2," Lift your forearms until they're parallel to the floor and perpendicular to your shoulders.This is known as ""silver gold technique"". Keep your elbows close to your sides. This will be your first move when the music turns on, so look slightly bewildered, like you've been jolted awake. Stop abruptly as you ""lock"" your arms in their desired position -- you can do the shoulder shrug right before you stop.








, After stopping for a second or two, start again and shift your forearms to the left while keeping your elbows at your sides and your torso pointing straight ahead. Your right arm should be draped across your stomach and your left arm should be extended out. Once you've reached this position, stop again.









Keep your face undisturbed by your dance moves. If you were looking to a particular direction, let it be the front or side stay how you are. This will amaze the viewers.

, Now, dip back slightly and then move forward, like you're a machine adjusting for a new movement. Then, move your feet so that they are pointing to the left too, in the same direction as your hands. Your feet should move mechanically, shifting to the left side to follow your arms, not fluidly, as they would in a normal dance move.








, Now, your head can jerk to the left and meet your arms and feet. You should do this any time you make adjustments to your body. Instead of having the head naturally follow your body, wait a second for the robot head to ""catch up"" as it gets the signal to move. Facing forward while the rest of your body moves to the side will emphasize the mechanical and disjointed nature of your dance.








, Then, bend downward toward your feet, so that your back is raised just above a ninety degree angle and your arms are both pointing to the left. You can shift your arms slightly so they're pointed in front of you instead of to the left, just as they were initially. Freeze. You can practice freezing in this motion longer than the others. You can also just freeze for a bit longer whenever the beat slows down.








, Take your right arm which is bent -- the arm closest to your audience, and jolt it upward so it straightens out, and then move it down to bend it again. This should look halting and not fluid. Repeat this motion three or four times, continuing to jerk it upward and then bending it again.








, After you move your robot arm down one last time, slowly straighten your back while facing your left and then face forward again. Keep your forearms bent at a ninety degree angle at your sides.








, Jerk your arms and shoulders back and your chest forward. Look slightly more alert and surprised when you do this. Freeze for a second or two. Keep up a bewildered expression as you transition into your next move. Then, stand straight up and jerk your arms around, one at a time, continuing to move your body as un-fluidly as possible. Move slightly to the left as you move your forearm down and up on the left side, and do the same on the right.








, After you've danced around for a while, repeat the same wave move on your left side. Just point your arms the the right, follow them with your feet, bend down, and then jerk your left arm up and down three or four times. After that, slowly make your way back up.








, You can move in erratic directions, continuing to move your arms up and down, stopping and starting and locking your body into new positions, popping open, and waving your robot arms from time to time. Just keep up this motion until the song is over or until you're tired -- then you can use a robotic voice to thank your friends for their support for your out-of-this-world moves.

Look at what you listen to daily.,
Know classic metal.,
Understand the sub-genres.,
Learn some metal facts.,
Welcome other tastes in music.",How to Tell if You Are a Metal Poser1," Make sure you actually listen to metal on a daily basis. Listening to a few metal songs at a friend's house or on a game doesn't make you a metalhead. If you use a software to play music, you can easily check what you’ve listened to by date and how many times you've listened to a song.


You should have at least a couple tracks from a metal band in your recently played playlist.;
, There are “godfathers” of metal that you should know, if you consider yourself a metalhead. There are also several bands that fall on the line of metal and classic rock. The reality of the situation is that genres are malleable and shouldn’t be taken as a strict label. Some of the classic rock/metal bands are Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Iron Maiden. Other classic metal bands are:


Metallica
Megadeth
Slayer
Death
Judas Priest
Pantera, Make sure you know a few bands of every subgenre of metal. Just a few major metal subgenres are thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal and speed metal. Many metalheads consider adolescents who listen ""metalcore"" and claim to be metalheads to be posers.


Metalcore includes bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Of Mice and Men, and Escape the Fate.
A list of a few bands and their respective subgenres are in the tips section.

, Know random trivia about bands like Motorhead, Metallica, Pantera, Death, Iron Maiden, Children of Bodom, and any other band you like. Statements like ""Slipknot Sucks!"" or ""Metallica is the only good metal band"" are typical statements from a metalhead poser. If you only like one band, you don't like metal thus you're not qualified to be a ""Metalhead"" but rather, you are a ""Bandhead"".However, there is one exception to this rule. If a person likes Metallica and has only listened to Metallica, then he or she can still be considered a genuine metalhead, but an adolescent metalhead to say the least.
There are ways to learn metal information, for example, by watching episodes of “That Metal Show”
There is great information about metal music in various guitar player magazines and a select number of music/rock magazines.

, Being a metalhead does not mean you reject every other genre of music. A metalhead (as well as everyone else) should exercise an open mind and be reasonable. Metal in general may be considered good music, but not all good music is metal.


Being a metalhead is a matter of personal expression. If you are open to showing your passion, don’t make fun of others who wish to share what they love.There is also a growing community of electronic and experimental musicians that are inspired heavily from metal. Noise as a genre of music isn’t a genre of metal, but the music and musicians doing this are metal.

"
"
Be around fellow metalheads.,
Practice kindness.,
Respect the metalhead title.,
Wear metal clothing.,
Avoid poser trends.",How to Tell if You Are a Metal Poser2," Make sure you have friends that love metal. The biggest reason to surround yourself with fellow metalheads is to share your thoughts on metal and learn from them but don’t exclude any of your friends who don’t appreciate or like metal. If they are your friends, you should be able to get along regardless of music preference.

, Be sure to not be a jerk. Metal is aggressive, but this doesn't mean you have to act aggressively. Metal music is an expression of human emotions. Metal became so popular because it is an outlet for fans and musicians to channel the darker emotions of life.


All good art channels universal human emotions in a way that reacts with you. Metal certainly can have a moving effect on you, but don’t let that alter the way you treat others., Claiming to be a metalhead does not make you one.You should also realize that metal has almost nothing to do with fashion. It is okay to wear a t-shirt of your favorite band or a leather jacket, but you certainly don’t have to.


Metal is completely about being yourself; there is no model to follow. Be a metalhead out of your love for this music, not for the fame or the attention.
Remember: being a metalhead does not mean making all of your conversations based around music., While style doesn’t dictate a metalhead, you can still look good while rocking out. Check online to see if your favorite band has merchandise that you like. The classic metalhead will have a handful of metal band t-shirts. It is similar to the punk aesthetic in this sense.


Wear guitar pick necklaces, or other instrument related things, if you can play the instrument.

, There are several aspiring metalheads who get wrapped up in trending dress styles. Stores like Hot Topic can have plenty of gear, but a lot of their merchandise is for fading trends. If you find a t-shirt from a band you like that you think is cool, go ahead and buy it. Avoid spending all your money at a store like this.


Being a metalhead is all about authenticity. You cannot buy your way into a lifestyle.
At the end of the day, being a metalhead is about the music and your devotion as a fan.

"
"
Play an instrument.,
Learn classic metal songs.,
Start a metal band with your metalhead friends.,
Go to good metal shows.,
Keep your metal roots as you grow up.",How to Tell if You Are a Metal Poser3," Choose an instrument from the classic arrangement of metal. You have the guitar, drums, bass, or keyboard. Keyboard isn’t as popular of an instrument for metal, but it does have its place. Pick what you love the most from the genre. If you catch yourself playing air guitar during a Van Halen song, pick up the guitar.


If you notice yourself tapping out rhythms while listening to motorhead on the bus, start playing the drums.

, Once you start playing an instrument and learn the basics, attempt to play a song you know well. It is easier to learn songs that you already know by heart. This way when you are reading tabs online, you won’t need to listen to the song repeatedly.


You can get far by learning classic metal songs like “Master of Puppets,” “Thunderstruck,” or “Iron Man.”, The best way to start a band with your friends is by assigning instruments in the beginning. That way each person can pick out an instrument to learn and dedicate time to practice. Once you all become decent at your instruments, try to write a song together.


It especially helps if you have this conversation before Christmas.
It is easier to write a song as a band if the guitar player creates a riff before practice. That way she can show it to the group and the band will waste less time.
It is also good for a band to become comfortable together by learning metal songs.
Have a decent space to practice music., Look at local venues in your area that host metal shows. A lot of venues host shows that have age restrictions like “18+” or “21+”. Look on the venue’s website before showing up to the venue.


If you follow a specific metal band, check to see if they have an upcoming tour.

, Many people start out as metalheads in middle school but start to lose their roots as they grow up. Be true to your metalhead roots if you want to be a true metalhead. Even if you take a break from listening to metal for a month or a year, you can still enjoy metal.

Start with something small, like a Guitar Hero controller or a ukulele, before jumping into anything serious.,
Wear a hooded sweatshirt.,
Check the height of the strap, make sure it's not too high and restricting, or low and loose.,
Move on from your toy guitar to something a little more serious.,
Know that now that you can seriously smash windows and such, it's time to reinforce that non-locking strap.,
Test your technique with an electric guitar of little value.,
Feel free to try this with a more valuable guitar when you have the technique mastered, but never try it on your most important guitar.",How to Spin a Guitar," Obviously spinning these will not teach you how to spin an electric guitar, but they will teach you what not to do, such as what to do with your back during the rotation.;
, The strap will certainly scratch up your neck. You're going to begin practicing with front flip style spins, with the headstock in front. Make sure you have about 2 yards (1.8 m) of open space in every direction.

, If it's too high, the guitar may get caught on you. If it's too low, it will take a lot of power to get around, plus you'll have a very destructively large radius of swinging axe.


Without holding a pick, try to throw the guitar over your shoulder, making sure that the strap is resisting the guitar. It may take a few tries to get a feel for the rotation and power needed. Do not try to launch it on your first try. If anything, be light on your first few attempts. This plastic Guitar Hero controller is going to slap you in the back a few times.






If you're still not getting it, the trick is to have the guitar pulling against the strap, making the strap rotate around your body. Two examples, a bike chain, and a hula hoop. Surely a bike chain will not work without the proper tension. Now think of a hula hoop. The best way to keep it going around is balancing the speed and force with which it is spun.






When you feel you have figured how out to complete the spin, hold a pick properly, and try again; after all, you'll be doing these while playing.







, If one is handy, start with an acoustic guitar of little value. The method is actually different from the electric guitar throw, but an acoustic will be great to learn with due to its bulk, because you will need to be careful.

, If you have electrical tape, hockey tape, or duct tape, make some close passes to the strap button, sealing off the line used to take the strap on or off. Optionally, you may also tape the strap buttons to the strap. If you do tape the buttons, there will be a slight difference in the feel of the guitar while playing, but it will be more secure during spins. If you don't, you'll retain the natural feel, but you are slightly more likely to have an accident.


When you think you have a tough fit, give that guitar a few tosses, without a pick first, then later with one.


, That does not mean your brother's Stratocaster that you don't like, or your dad's old guitar that he keeps in that case in the attic, that means the guitar grandma bought you from Toys 'R' Us.


Step over the cord so it's behind you. Watch performers who spin their guitar on stage to see exactly how they deal with the cord, especially when spinning more than once.
This strap must be seriously reinforced. You're pushing a lot of weight this time, and you shouldn't wouldn't worry about the guitar as much as the windows, walls, televisions, and whatever else is within eye shot of you. This strap must never come off, especially when you consider doing these in a live setting. Hitting an audience member with your guitar could cause an injury, or even death.
Once your strap is reinforced, you're free to swing that thing wherever you want. It's easier than the acoustic to get around.

, Accidents can always happen.

Wait for the pit to break open.,
Listen to the music and go with the flow.,
Two-stepping during fast paced breakdowns is a good idea.,
Throw down when the music gets heavier and starts to sound very brutal.,
Throw in some spin kicks if there's room, or maybe try something that's unique.,
If the song seems to stop abruptly but the band still looks ready to go, then you're in for a breakdown any second.",How to Hardcore Dance," If you want to help open the crowd up then find some people around you who are into dancing and tell them you want to hardcore dance. Everyone should gather in a group and when the music starts begin pushing people out of the way by walking backwards with your arms extended. This is the more polite way to do it, and there are many other ways such as running as fast as you can at the people around you and jumping toward them.;
, Someone around you is going to know what they are doing, so just watch and see what everyone else is doing. Don't try to rip off peoples moves though, as this could get you tackled for being a rook. Just try to make sure you're not doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.

, This move is performed by taking your right leg and swinging it in front of your left, and then respectively pulling your left leg out from behind your right and throwing it in front(2 steps vary from city to city). If you're doing it right (and many beginners don't), you will have a running in place like effect going for you. You should try to move your arms to the beat as well, maybe by grabbing the air near your feet. Since hardcore dancing is done at hardcore shows making a gangsta limp hand or other similar things is not recommended seeing as most of the people there will not like rap or hip-hop.

, Swing your arms around with a closed fist back and forth in front of your body, perhaps balancing yourself on one foot and switching now and then or planting your feet and bending your knees. It helps add to the effect if you appear as though you have no absolutely no concern for the well-being or safety of anyone around you. This is usually referred to as ""the windmill"".

, As long as it goes with the flow of the music and is particularly violent in nature, it may be accepted in the circle. You can also try some other trademark moves like ""picking up the change"", which is performed by standing with your feet shoulder length apart and brutally punching downwards at the ground. This can also be performed instead by punching the sky or air that is directly in front of you.

, Put your fist up in the air and start walking across the circle, and throw it down just as the music starts again, then proceed with step 4. Sometimes this sudden pause is the queue for a Wall of Death. That is where the crowd parts into two sides and slams into each other like in the movie Braveheart (this move is also called such). If you are in the circle, and the crowd appears to be shifting, move to one side or you will be trampled unless you join the fray.

Choose the right footwear.,
Get warmed up.,
Choose some music.",How to Street Dance1," You will want sturdy shoes for street dancing.


Well made sneakers or high top hip hop shoes will work very well for street dancing.
Try to avoid wearing old, beat up shoes. The style of sneakers you wear doesn't matter as much, but it is important that they are sturdy and comfortable.
Try to get a pair of high-quality shoes made from strong canvas or leather, with a strong support sole.;
, You don't want to just start dancing without warming up. This can lead to an injury.Try skipping, jogging in place, or jumping rope to warm up your muscles and increase your heart rate.
Try gentle stretches of the major muscle groups, holding them for 10-15 seconds each.
Steady - rhythmic activity will also prepare you for dancing.

, Street dance is all about music that has a strong beat.Hip hop or rap music is traditionally used for street dancing.
You want to avoid anything slow. Keep the music vibrant and up tempo.
Feel the beat of the music and use it to help you move to the music.

Practice balancing on all sides of your feet. Once that's easy, balance on one at a time. Throw your body around both slowly and quickly. Once balancing in one position becomes easy, work on transitioning from one stance to another, never wavering.;
, Just like in dubstep, isolations are key in krump. This means being able to move one part of your body without moving any other. The most important skill you'll have in this domain will be in isolating your chest, but you should practice isolating every part of your body. Start with your neck and work your way downward.









Rotate each part of your body in circles, taking turns going both clockwise and counterclockwise. Your head should be simple enough, but your shoulders will be a bit more difficult. Make sure you don't move your core as your shoulders rotate. When you get to your chest, make sure you're not moving your shoulders or stomach. Practice going to the sides and back and forth, too.

, You're in a slight squat, bending at the knees -- kinda like you're playing D in basketball. Your balance is centered. This will be the position you always return to when in doubt.









Even make your stance ""buck."" That's the slang term for being aggressive. If someone tells you your style is buck, that's a compliment! You're hitting your moves hard and on point.Keep this in mind as you learn the moves we detail below.

, One of the basic tenets of krump is the stomp. There are three to work with:










The lift stomp. Just like it sounds -- you lift your leg up before you bring it down to stomp. Generally, the knee stays bent at near a 90º angle.

The kick stomp. Also self-explanatory -- bring your leg straight, kick it out, and bring it back down to a stomp.

The slide stomp. You guessed it -- you slide out (either forward or to the side) and raise it up before finishing in a stomp.

, Once you've got the isolations down, the chest pop will be a piece of cake. You simply pop your chest forward quickly and bring it back -- it's sort of like a pulse. Experiment with a stomp, followed by a chest pop. If that's easy, grab your shirt and pop like you're pulling yourself forward.








, The origins of krump are clearly seen in the arm swings. They're aggressive yet under control -- think of them as Muhammad Ali jabs. They can be to any direction, just make sure they're quick and punctuated and not flailing all over the place!









Your hands can take any position you'd like. They can be punches, your hands could form blades, be holding apples, however you'd like to do it is fine, so long as it fits your spirit and the music.

, No, not to foreign lands. Travel across the floor. This is most often done in a slide or glide (also like in dubstep), but can be done in any way you can imagine.









To glide, put all your weight onto one foot and point the other. Slide the pointed foot across the floor and switch your weight. Keep switching until you've traveled far enough. That's really all it is!

, Once you've mastered stomps, chest pops, arm swings, and traveling, you're really pretty much done. Hard to believe, huh? The rest is where you and your character come into play. A trick can be whatever you want it to be!









Syncs are really just a combination of moves, often done at once or in close sequence.Puzzles are movements (often many) done with your hands and arms.Think of a badass mime.
A kill-off is when you demonstrate how you would literally kill someone. But it's dance-y and beautiful and thus not clearly violent. You might simulate a butt-kicking, but it only lasts a matter of seconds.

, Also similar to dubstep, part of the ""look"" of krumping is hitting a beat fiercely (like in a chest pop) and then taking the next few beats slow or fluidly. Listen to the piece of music you're working with. What beats sound like they pop and which beats sound like they flow?








, Krumping is a manifestation of your inner self. If you are silly, aggressive, or stylish it should show in your dancing. It will become your character and determine your original style. Make up your name and start practicing tailoring your moves to your character. No two people should krump the same!








, If ever there was a purpose for YouTube, it was now. You can even watch competitions by the pioneers of krump -- along with some pretty inspirational documentaries about the lives of those its improved. And, of course, tutorials on how to do it!









Any video with Tight Eyez, Retro, or Ruin will be worth your while. Also look at the Krump championships and at how battles are structured. EBS (European Buck Session) has tons of stuff, too. Maybe you could go to next year's finals!
If you live in a big city, it's possible that there are classes on this style of dance in your area. Krump isn't something that should be done alone! The positive, unstoppable feeling it breeds gets magnified in a group.

, If you watch yourself in the mirror when you first start, it'll be easy to get discouraged. You'll just end up thinking, ""Geez, I look like a mentally handicapped beached whale compared to the videos."" While it's easy to suck at krumping, it'll come with time. You gotta experiment and fail to get better. In fact, that's the only way.









Try recording yourself or coming up with a routine at first. Eventually you'll want to be able to do it off-the-cuff, but for now you need structure. Doing the same moves over and over is a necessary part of the learning curve.
Use your krumping to say something. Think of your message -- it'll help cue you as to what moves feel right.

, Since it's all about the spiritual, your freedom, and your inner motivation, this dance is a reflection of you -- and if you don't know what you're feeling or what you embody, your dance will reflect that. So find a part of you that you want to let out. Look inside to bring it to the surface. It'll make your dance that much better.









And that much more unique. It doesn't matter what you do -- you just gotta do it with purpose, conviction, and, most importantly, passion.

, If you're part of a ""fam,"" you'll be able to get into battles pretty quickly. The more you win, the higher level of krump you'll be able to achieve. You can even change your name as you get more victories under your belt. Though battles aren't necessary to krump, they are an integral part of the scene.








, Krump stands for ""Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise."" It was started by Tight Eyez, Lil C, Big Mijo, Slayer, and Hurricane.Though on the outside it looks incredibly violent (heck, you have moves showing the other person how you would kill him), its proponents are actually actively non-violent. It is a spiritual form of dance with Christian roots and most of those who krump see it as a means of getting closer to God, whoever or whatever that is to them.









Because of that, you'll never see booty dropping', grinding, or other overtly sexual movements that would deface the krump name. It's about expressing yourself, sure, but it's more about praise and feeling a universal connection to the spirit of the music.

, Krump was started for those who needed an alternative to violence. It's a spiritual outlet that allows its artists an escape, a means of expressing themselves, and a means of being free. Krump is hope, life, regeneration. Krump is transformation from the self to the spirit. It breeds positive excitement and energy. Krump is passion. Krump takes you from your body and turns your spirit into a warrior. It's so much more than arm swings and stomping.









Krump keeps kids off the streets. Now there's a slogan for you! Its purpose is much greater than what meets the eye. It's a way of living, a way of thinking, and a way of being.

, It should go without saying that in order to krump, you kinda gotta be able to hear the tempo and feel the rhythm. It's essential that you not only can carry a beat but also feel the build up, the crescendo, and sense when to use your power and when to keep it brewing. Find a piece of music you really like and get to know it like the back of your hand.








, Part of the beauty of krump is the family mentality that it inspires. If you get in a group where you all get it, that bond can't be broken. You and those with you create your own safe haven based on self-expression and artistic freedom. You'll watch other, not judging, but seeing the passion fill them as they dance.









Because of that, it's not really about skill. If you feel it, those around you will be able to tell. Even if your moves aren't all that, it doesn't matter. If you get it, it'll show. If you feel better afterward, that's all that matters.

Perform a pop move.,
Lean to the right to perform a pop move on the other side.,
Follow the ""pop"" dance moves with a ""lock"" step.While ""pop"" steps are more sharp and stiff, lock moves are more fluid.You will begin this by turning to your right slightly and bending both knees.,
Mix up pop and lock moves to add variety to your dancing.",How to Street Dance2," To do this you will first lean to the left.Raise your right arm to shoulder level as you lean.
Once your arm reaches shoulder level, flex your muscles and ground your shoulders.
This will result in a sharp, ""pop"" of a dance move.
Repeat this once more, leaning to the left.

, This will be very similar to doing this move towards the left.Raise your left arm to shoulder level as you lean to the right.
Once your arm reaches shoulder level, flex your muscles and ground your shoulders.
This will result in a sharp, ""pop"" dance move in the opposite direction of what you just performed to the left.
Repeat this move again, leaning to the right.

,
From this position, bring your elbows up and out to the sides. Lock into that arm position twice, using fluid movements.
Finish the move by turning your left arm in, rotating it all the way under and extending it straight outwards while pointing your finger.
Repeat this last arm move to the other side.

, Street dancing is all about free flowing freestyle moves.Feel the beat and incorporate these moves with the beat.
Be creative and add your own spin or flare to these basic moves.
Make your movements big and slightly exaggerated to emphasize your dancing.

Start with your feet apart.,
Roll your shoulders forward, then look down.,
Roll your shoulders back and lift your head.,
Ground yourself in starting position.",How to Street Dance3," They should be about shoulder width apart.Lift your heels up off the ground.
Then push your heels back down onto the ground, bending your knees slightly.
Your hips will now come forward, followed by your ribs and chest.

, This is one of the most important parts of this key dance move.If you don't roll your shoulders forwards and then look down, you aren't completing a full body wave.
This move is very fluid, and should be performed with the beat.
The next part is to reverse the move and return to starting position.

, As you do this you should lift your heels off of the ground.Follow this by waving your chest and belly back.
Roll your hips back next.
Push your heels back to the ground.

, From here, you can do this body wave move again or incorporate other street dance moves, like popping and locking, into your routine.Remember to have fun. Street dancing is a vibrant and energetic type of dance.
The order and sequence of your moves don't necessarily matter so much in street dance. Freestyling is preferred over pre-planned routines.
Don't be afraid to add your own arm movements or additions to each move. Be creative!

Find a smooth, flat surface.,
Wear comfortable shoes with smooth soles.,
Pivot your right foot so that your toe is facing out and raise your right heel.,
Slide your left foot out to the side and turn it out, just as you did with your right foot.,
Bring your left heel up as you move your right heel down.,
Bring your right heel down and turn the toe inwards.,
Switch your toe and heel, bringing your right toes up and out and your left heel down and in.,
Slide your left foot out to get into the starting position.,
Repeat these steps again until you get comfortable with them and can move fluidly.,
Keep practicing.,
Do The Usher.,
Glide while only pointing one of your feet.,
Create boxes while you glide.,
Do the circle glide.",How to Glide Dance," A hardwood floor works best when you're gliding for the first time. You can also use the tiled or linoleum floor in your kitchen. Once you get more comfortable with it, you can use carpet if you have to, but for best results, start with the smoothest surface, which will allow you to glide with the greatest ease. If you have no luck indoors, you can start outside, on a concrete surface such as a basketball court. If you're indoors, though, you should try to practice in front of a mirror, if you can, so you can watch your own footwork.;
, If you have old shoes with worn soles, don't throw them out -- they'll be perfect for gliding. You don't want a shoe with ridges on the soles or a strong grip, because you want to be able to slide along the floor as easily as you can; shoes with a strong grip will keep you from making fluid movements. If you have shoes with smooth soles and a smooth floor, you're halfway there already. Once you've got those things, stand with your feet hip-width apart.

, Put your body weight on your right toes. You should be able to lift your left foot and move it easily because there is no weight on it. Shifting your weight up and over your right toes is an important part of this step. You can keep your arms at your sides and shift them up and forward, too, to help you keep your balance. If you're a lefty, you can start with your left foot, if that makes things easier, but it doesn't really matter because you'll be using both feet the same way eventually.


The most important thing to note when you begin to learn to glide is that one of your feet should always be flat while the other foot should always be on its toes or the balls of the feet. You should always be prepared to transition from one to the other.
You should aim for the balls of your feet. If you become a true expert, you can even go for your toes, but for now, this should be just enough. The less of your foot you use, the more impressive your gliding will look. However, this will also make it more difficult to maintain your balance.

, Think of it as pushing your right foot up, and then pulling your left foot to the left.

, Always remember the rule about keeping one heel up and one heel down at all times. Make sure your body weight switches to the new toe each time you change feet, as it will allow you to slide your feet in and out more easily. At first, this transition may feel a little clunky, but you'll get the hang of it and will be able to make it look like one fluid motion, like a wave traveling through you.

, Slide it toward your left foot. Just do exactly what you did with your left foot with your right foot.

, Your feet should be very close to each other, with your right heel hovering over your left toes.

, Return to the place where you started -- standing with your feet hip distance apart.

, Reverse the feet so you travel back in the opposite direction. You can just start by moving all the way to the left and then all the way to the right, and then practice moving back and forth, up and down, or diagonally as you become more comfortable with gliding.

, If you want your glide movements to look really fluid and natural, then you've gotta keep practicing. Spend at least fifteen minutes a day gliding to your favorite hip hop beat and you'll be amazed at how quickly you improve. Once you get the footwork down, you'll be able to use your arms more, instead of just keeping them at your sides. You can put your whole body into it, and find a way to move around that is completely unique.

, If you want to take the basic side glide a step further, do The Usher to add an extra kick to your new dance moves. Usher does the side glide by over-rotating the hip of the foot that is pointed. So, if you're starting by pointing your right foot, just swing your right foot out to the right by pivoting your hip before you point your foot. Continue to over-rotate the pointed foot as you glide from side to side.

For another addition to this move, do the Booker Forte. This less well-known move requires you to not only over-rotate the leg and hip of the pointed foot, but to also swing the sliding foot's hip and leg around a bit more as you slide out.

, If you're sick of switching between pointing and sliding your left and right foot, you can just stick to having one foot be your pointed foot and one foot be your sliding foot. You can still move to one side, forward and back, or even diagonally, while using this technique. You can use one foot for pointing for a while and then switch things up, only using the other foot., If you want to take it to the next level, you can work on switching directions by turning your body 90 degrees when you switch your body weight from your left toe to your right toe, and vice versa. After you point one foot, slide the other foot in the new direction. Do this with every step to create boxes. The only difference between this move and the side glide is that you'll be gliding along the four corners of an imaginary box. You can even help yourself by eyeballing or marking the four corners of the box with your foot.

, Once you've got the box glide down, you can take it a step further by smoothing out those corners and gliding in a circle. Dance in circles by pulling your right foot in past your left foot and then pushing your left foot in a diagonal motion rather than straight. Instead of creating four nice walls of a box, you'll be moving your feet in a pattern that mimics a circle. Repeat the motion with both feet and you will dance in a fluid, circular motion.


Once you're moving in a circle in one direction for a little while, you can mix it up and move in the opposite direction. This will also keep you from getting dizzy.
You don't have to stick to the same exact circle pattern every time. You can make the circle bigger or smaller, or even move to the left or right as you create another circle. This will take some coordination, but it'll look great.

Start out by going to the clubs and trying to catch the names of the songs you like best.,
Download the song or get it in the store.

,
After listening to it, go online and get the lyrics to the song.,
Listen to the song often (while you run, while you clean the house, in the car, over and over).,
Go to the club and start by checking out the basic moves people do, they are often good bridges.,
Go by yourself or go with a friend you really feel comfortable with that you don't have to hang out with the whole night.,
Keep it real.",How to Dance to Rap Music," Go to the DJ and ask; it's a compliment, and he or she will more often than not be happy to tell you. If it's too loud and you don't get it by the second time, don't sweat it, you're almost certain to hear it again.;
,, Then you learn the lyrics and get the story. Rap music (particularly hip hop as opposed to rap) almost always has an infectious beat so it's cool to dance to. You'll feel it when you listen to what they say (even if it's old territory like braggin' on themselves). LL Cool J hasn't said all that much different from his first album, but Headsprung rocks, and knowing the lyrics helps.

, The beat will start to take you over.

, However, very few people let loose and those who do usually get tons of compliments. But don't do it to get the compliments or even to pick up women necessarily. Instead, dance because it's the ultimate way for you to feel the message and the music.

, Hit the floor and dance while you spit as many of the lyrics as you can and act out the lyrics. (Like when Outkast says ""drip drip drop, there goes an ear-gasm"", you can lean your head to the side like you're trying to get water out of your ear. Or when T.I. says ""Bring 'Em Out"", put both hands in the air and wave 'em on.) Go by yourself because rap has this unusual ability to make groups of dancers (guys in particular) become really peacock-ish and aggressive. It's so unfortunate, because dancing to rap and hip hop is just about having fun. You should be able to dance comfortably with dudes far tougher than you, because you are all just doing your thing.

, Don't pretend you're something you're not. The very best rap and hip hop is that because it's real. You don't have to be hard to dance to rap well.

Stand with your right foot behind your left foot.,
Jump backwards onto your left foot and simultaneously slide your right foot forward.,
Repeat by stepping backwards onto your right foot.",How to Jerk1," Keep your thighs close together and your torso relaxed.A big part of this move is appearing to fall backward. Try to look like you're leaning backwards while actually keeping your center of gravity in your hips.
The reject is considered the standard jerkin' move. A major aspect of jerkin' is to display as much frenetic energy as possible. Your legs should never stop moving. Instead, do the reject while getting into the groove and figuring out what moves to do next.;
, When your left foot is flat on the ground, your right foot should be in the air, toes up. Make it look like you're running backwards without moving from your spot.


, Slide your left foot forward with your toes in the air. Keep repeating with each foot. Go as quickly as you can to make it look like you are running backwards in place.


Do whatever you want with your arms. Some dancers keep theirs up or swinging in opposite time with their legs."
"
Hop forward onto your right leg.,
Switch legs.,
Repeat hopping twice on each foot.",How to Jerk2," Your right leg and upper body should be straight. While hopping, bend your left leg at the knee so that your left calf is perpendicular to the rest of your body. Your left leg's toes should be pointing down.


This version of the reject is more high energy and requires better balance than the first version. While jerkin', you can switch it up between the two to add some variety to your dance.

, Your left foot should now be on the ground behind you and your right leg in front with toes pointing up. Then jump forward with your left foot directly under your body and bring your right foot back. Now your right foot's toes should be facing the ground.

, Do these moves fast enough and it should look like you're skipping backwards. Just keep hopping the pattern:


Right foot on the ground, left leg bent back with toes down.
Left foot back on the ground, right foot forward in the air with toes up.
Left foot forward on the ground, right leg bent back with toes down.
Right foot back on the ground, left foot forward in the air with toes up."
"
Stand straight on your left leg and cross your right foot behind your left knee.,
Bend your left knee and drop towards your left side.,
Hit the ground.,
Stand back up.",How to Jerk3," Your legs should look like a number 4.


This is a move that requires a lot of flexibility and strength. Do not attempt the pin drop if you are new to dance or are prone to ankle sprains.
Many jerk dancers do multiple pin drops in quick succession between periods of doing the reject. The more pin drops you do at once, the more difficult it becomes to right yourself as you get dizzier. A dance with a lot of quick pin drops in a row is very impressive.

, Control your fall so you don't go too fast. Remember that your aim is to appear to fall while actually lowering yourself to the ground with your leg muscles. Getting this step right takes a lot of practice.

, You should land mainly on your right foot with your left knee in front of it. Timing your fall so that your foot lands flat will keep you from bruising your knee. Feel free to use your hands for balance., Use your right foot to push yourself. Twist a little and corkscrew clockwise as you stand. You can follow this move by mirroring it, starting out on the opposite leg."

Understand the history and implications of the crip walk.,
Learn the shuffle.,
Learn the V. The V is probably the most well-known and recognizable part of crip walking.,
Learn the heeltoe.,
Put it all together.",How to Crip Walk," The crip walk is a controversial dance move which originated in the 1970s in South Central Los Angeles, among members of the Crip gang.


Originally, the foot movement used in crip walking was meant to spell out the letters ""C-R-I-P"" and was used to display gang affiliation at parties and other gatherings.Later, the dance was used as a signature by Crip gang members after they had committed a crime, as the foot movement would leave distinctive shuffle marks on the ground.
As a result of these associations, crip walking was banned from a large number of schools in certain L.A. neighborhoods, while MTV refused to play any rap or hip-hop videos (such as those by Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Kurupt) containing the crip walk.
More recently, the crip walk has been appropriated by American culture and, in general, is no longer intended to display gang affiliation.
However, it is important to be aware of the history and implications of the crip walk, as performing it could still potentially cause offence in certain situations.;
, The shuffle is the most basic part of the c-walk. To shuffle, stand with your right foot planted firmly on the ground and your left leg extended out in front of you, balanced on the ball of your left foot.


Now, reverse this position by standing firmly on your left foot while your right leg is extended in front of you, balanced on the ball of your right foot. Jump as you switch your feet, so the switch is completed in one fluid movement.
Now keep jumping and switching your feet -- this is the basic shuffle movement. You can make it more interesting by moving sideways or around in a circle as you jump, or by keeping the same foot forward in a double jump.

Variation: A common variation on the shuffle step is the shuffle kick. To do the shuffle kick, balance your front foot on the heel rather than the toe and give it a flick to the side.
Alternating between the basic shuffle step and the shuffle kick will add more flavor to your crip-walk.

, To get started, stand with your heels together and your toes pointed outwards, forming a V shape.


Now switch so that your toes are together and your heels are pointed outwards, forming an inverted V. Alternate between these two V shapes, to get a feel for the movement.
To do the proper V movement, start with your heels together and your toes pointing outwards. Now swivel your right heel outwards, so that both feet are parallel to one another and pointing towards the left.
Swivel your left toes inwards (towards the right) to join your right toes, so your feet form an inverted V shape. Swivel your right toes outwards so that both feet are parallel again, this time pointing towards the right. Now bring your left heel in to join the right one, so you are back to starting position. Practice this movement going back and forth and starting with each foot until you have it down.

Variations: A common variation on the V is the step back. Instead of bringing both heels together to form a V shape, place one foot behind the other so that the heel of your front foot is wedged against the arch (or sometimes the toe) of your back foot.
To do a move known as the V step, you basically have to do the V with one foot and the shuffle with the other foot. In other words, your right foot is forming a half V shape (pivoting first on your heel then on your toe) while the left foot is going forwards and backwards in a shuffle movement, as you move sideways towards the right. Switch feet (left foot doing the V, right foot shuffling) when you change directions.

, The heel to toe is perhaps the hardest part of the crip walk and will require some practice.



Type one: Turn so that your body is facing diagonally towards the right, then put your left foot forward, balancing on the heel. Swivel on your left heel and the ball of your right foot until your body is facing diagonally towards the left.
Now jump and switch feet so your right foot is in front, balanced on the heel, and your left foot is behind. Keep practicing this movement until you get it fast and smooth.
You can add some variation to the movement by doing a double heeltoe -- do the heeltoe as normal but instead of switching feet try to swivel in the same direction twice, keeping the same foot in front.

Type two: The second type of heeltoe is pretty much the same as the first, except for one major difference. Instead of balancing on the ball of your back foot, try to balance on your toe. Then instead of swiveling on your toe, drag it across the ground as you change directions.

Type three: The third type of heeltoe involves the same movement as the first, except that you keep repeating the heeltoe with the same foot in front while moving in one direction. So, starting with your body facing diagonally towards the right and your left heel in front, swivel so that your body is facing diagonally towards the left. Now instead of switching feet, jump back to the starting position (facing the right, left heel in front) and repeat the movement again.

, A good crip walk will involve a combination of the movements described above, with as many variations and as much personal style thrown in as possible.


Just try to get the movements as smooth and fluid as possible -- crip walking is supposed to look effortless and loose, not tight and exact.
Practice as you listen to your favorite hip-hop or rap tunes and try to dance in time with the beat.
What you do with your arms is up to you -- some people leave them loose at their sides, while others put their hands on their hips.
Remember that everyone's c-walk is unique, so just do what feels good for you.

Stand with your feet side by side.,
Move one foot straight in the air in front of the other foot.,
As your weight transfers to the toes of that foot, glide it back to its original position.,
When the first foot moves back to its original position, the other foot should point up on its toes.,
Move the other foot up and forward and repeat.,
Keep moving forward.,
Practice.,
Tap your toes with each step.,
Tap your heel and toe with each step.,
Do the airwalk along with the moonwalk.",How to Airwalk," They should be about hip's distance apart, as if you're walking as you normally would. The airwalk is all about your feet, so you don't have to worry about what to do with your arms or the rest of your body quite yet. If you've never tried this before, some people recommend that you sit with your feet apart to master the movements of your feet before standing.


To get a stronger sense of what your feet are doing, you can practice in front of a mirror or even film yourself or ask a friend to watch you.;
, Let the foot hover there straight, without pointing your toes, at about a 45 degree angle from the ground, with your toes above your heel. Lift the foot up in the air, with your toes leading, as if you were stepping over a barrier that is about half a foot tall, except that your foot won't hit the ground when you step over it and will pull back instead.

, Your legs should be straight and you shouldn't bend your knees at all when you do this. Just glide the foot back to where it started, with the heel dragging it back until it naturally touches the ground. Think of it as rocking your weight forward before you transition to the other foot.

, When you do the airwalk, you should never have both feet be flat on the ground at the same time. When one foot is moving back, the other should be preparing to move forward. It can take a little while to get into the rhythm. Just remember what we said about it being like riding a bicycle — when you're riding a bike, your feet are always in constant motion, too. If you stop one of them, then you'll stall.

, Now, just do what you did with the other foot — lift your other foot forward, with the toe leading, as if you were stepping over a short barrier, and then drag it back, as if a string were attached to your heel and was slowly dragging it back. As the forward foot moves back, the other foot should prepare to move forward by lifting up on its toes.

, Just keep doing the airwalk by raising one foot at a time and moving forward for as long as you like. You can start by practicing in place and then slowly moving forward, so you're moving forward at a much slower pace than you would if you were walking, as if you're walking on air or are having to move forward in a low-gravity situation.


When you move forward, try to form a ""V"" shape with your feet as they transition. So, when the foot that is up in the air moves back to meet the other, the heel of that foot should land where the toe of the other foot is pointed, so they create a ""V"" together as the pointed foot moves forward, and so on. This will keep you moving forward at the same pace.

, It can take some practice to get this move down, but it'll be worth it. It can also be easier to learn the moonwalk first, before you get the airwalk down, since some people think the airwalk is a little bit trickier. Once you master the airwalk, you can work on airwalking and then transitioning to the moonwalk and back to the airwalk again. You can also work on gliding, which will use somewhat similar techniques, except you'll be moving from side to side.


As you get more comfortable with the airwalk, you can wave your shoulders a bit, and get your arms into it. Just move your arms forward and back, just as you would if you were walking forward normally, except at a slower pace to sync up with your feet.
Remember to keep the movement as fluid as possible, so it looks like you're walking on air.

, Once you've got the airwalk down, you can add this small variation to make the movement more interesting. All you have to do is take the foot that is pointed on its toes, ready to move forward, move it forward, tap its toes on the ground, and then do the normal airwalking move, where the foot moves forward with the toes leading up above the heel. Then, move the foot back and do the same with the other foot, tapping its toes on the ground in front of it before it also moves forward.

, Another thing you can do is to tap the heel of each foot, and then its toe, before you take a step forward. If you've mastered being able to tap each toe once before you move forward, then you should be able to tap the heel and then the toe of each foot as it takes a step without a problem. Watch yourself in the mirror to make sure that you've got the rhythm down.

, Once you become a master at the airwalk, you can work on walking forward for about thirty seconds or so, and then transitioning into the moonwalk, so you walk backwards to the place where you started. Then you can go right back into the airwalk, moving forward again, and then move backward using the moonwalk whenever you feel like it.


The trickiest part will be the transition, and you have to work on not stalling or stopping, but transitioning right from moving forward to moving backward, and vice versa.

If you aren't blonde like Ali, consider having your hair dyed. Go for a blonde color that matches your skin tone. Consider having your hair dyed at a salon professionally, it will turn out looking better and the hairdresser will know what is the perfect color for you.
Keep your hair long and healthy. After having your hair dyed, it's time to start taking care of it. Wash your hair whenever it gets even a little oily, with a good and nice smelling shampoo and conditioner. After washing it, try using a serum. #*To get Ali's hairstyle, remember she straightens maybe 7 times every year. Her hair is usually always done in someway whether it was braided overnight or turned up and inward at the ends. For her signature hairstyle, take some hair that you want to sit on the front of your shoulders and leave the rest on your back. Then curl the front hair tightly and the hair on your back more loosely, but still noticeably curly. Remember away from the face. Another style is to get a strand of hair from the upper-right side of your hair, the part by your face. Not a handful, but where bangs might be (don't get bangs). Twist it to the bottom, or braid it halfway. Get the braid or the twist, and clip or pin it to the side of your head. Repeat on the other side. When you complete this, get some good-smelling spray gel, and spray it lightly over the outside of all your hair. Then get good quality hairspray, and spray it on the little twist-or-braid things, including the clips. But remember to curl the bottom still. If your hair is frizzy, consider having it straightened.;
, Even if you don't wash your hair, take a shower everyday to get rid of body odor. Use a nice scented shower gel. For even better hygiene, always use deodorant. You can also use perfume. Ali's signature scent is vanilla, so try to get vanilla perfume, vanilla body spray, vanilla everything. Use body lotion regularly to keep your skin hydrated and use a body scrub once a week. Never forget shaving, it is really important too.


Keep your hands and feet also hydrated and with beautiful, well-treated nails. Don't bite your nails. Keep them long, and use feminine nail polish colors, like red, pink, turquoise or just wear a french tip manicure or clear nail polish. Alison's favorite nail colors are light blue and white.

, Alison has a great body. She's not super skinny, so don't go all out for a skinny body, but she's thin, so always keep in shape, but with some curves. Exercise and eat healthy and you will look and feel better.

, Alison has a very feminine/girly style, so go for clothes with flowers, ruffles, anything girly. Don't forget your own style, but if you dress a bit tomboy like, try to spice up your looks a little bit with some accessories. Always wear clothes that show up your body. Alison likes to wear revealing clothes in a way of being the center of attention, so do the same and wear short dresses and skirts, revealing tops and high-heels, but never look trashy. Wear simple, cute accessories and always carry a big purse with you. Try to have at least one high-fashion dress for a special occasion.

, Alison is always one step ahead of everything, so of course she has to be prepared for what comes around. In your purse, always keep your keys, your phone and its charger, some gum, a pair of sunglasses, some makeup that you need to touch up along the day (powder, eyeliner, mascara, lip gloss, chap stick, etc.), some elastics and bobby pins, deodorant, a wallet with your cards and money, a pack of tissues, a compact mirror, a travel-sized hairbrush and hand sanitizer, tampons/pads, some pain medication, and if you wear contacts, always keep your case and eye drops in there too. Also, keep some healthy snacks, like a cereal bar or an apple, and maybe a pen and a little notebook to take some notes. Always have your ID with you too.

, Start out with washing your face and using some cleanser, to remove any makeup or dirt that could have stayed on your skin from the previous day. After that, apply some moisturizer.


Start off with some lightweight foundation or a BB Cream. Apply concealer to cover up any dark circles, redness or imperfections and settle everything with some powder. Use a brow pencil to fill your brows in, and don't leave in any bald spots. Alison's eyebrows aren't super dark so don't overdo it. Apply an eye-shadow primer.
Go for something neutral for your lids, like a bronze gold-ish color, or something more daring, like some violet or pink. Play with your eye-shadow. Apply a thin line of black eyeliner and wing it out, and apply a lot of mascara.
Give yourself a hairline, as this makes you look sun kissed.
For your lips, you can never go wrong with glossy pink or a red on special occasions.

, Alison could be evil some times, but she knew how to inspire, touch and make people feel special. Don't be afraid to say what you think, but when you see it hurts people you don't want to get hurt, brush it off and make them believe they took it the wrong way. When you don't like someone, try to tear that person down as much as you can.

, Alison has a very persuasive, seductive personality, which makes people do whatever she wants them to do. When you can't get what you want, use blackmail. Blackmailing people can be daring, but that's exactly what we're going for here. Don't be too mean, because Alison isn't heartless.

, Know people's secrets, and use them against them, to get what you want, when you need to.Think about what others would do or react to what you say and do, make sure your moves are perfect.

, Write about everything that happens, and be completely honest. Also, hide it somewhere safe. Have a plan to give it to someone like on Pretty Little Liars when Alison told Spencer her journal was for her. Plan to give it to them if your planning to guide them.

, Explore your house and discover places that no one can think of.

, Try looking for hot new groups that no one knows about yet. That way you'll always be up to date and one step ahead. Always keep your music taste though.

, Walk like you're on a runway. Move your hips and don't move your arms too much. When you're talking to someone and turn around to leave, always make a fun yet flirty hair move. Bat your lashes and side-smirk. Smile seductively, flirt and never yell, but yet keep your voice at a nice tone.

, As Alison herself said, You're always better off with a really good lie. If truth doesn't lead you anywhere, don't be afraid to lie. Have a good-planned lie always in the tip of your tongue.

, When someone ask where you've been or why you weren't at school, smirk a little and say ""Oh, I was nowhere."" That's the essence of Alison's personality.

, They will be your shoulder to cry on, and you must really like, and make them really like you. You must be the leader, without exactly stating you're the leader. Never let your friends boss you around. Know all of their secrets, but don't tell them yours. Always have plans like going to parties, sleepovers or going out on town.

, If you want to go to the best parties, you need a fake ID. Alison and the Liars had one, so try to get someone to do it for you or make it yourself.

, Make boys fall in love with you.

, Ali has a dark sense of humor along with her bubbly, outgoing personality. So make dryer jokes, be a little more sarcastic, but not all-out rude. Joke around more with your friends. Have a ton of good comebacks if you argue with someone.

, Alison is perky. You could say she's like a ballerina, she does daring moves but always lands safely. She is very jumpy and very daring, this doesn't mean you have to do everything, but once in a while, do something daring. Be bold and confident and don't let anyone boss you around, because in Pretty Little Liars Alison is the boss. But don't be mean to people, and don't let people be mean to you. Never hold your head down, keep it right on up, and think of the positive, happy ways. You don't need to do everything daring just sometimes do something brave and cool and people will look at you in a different way. And they will begin to like you.

, Ali is always on top of things. Be mischievous. Know how to make people do what YOU want them to do and know how to make people believe you. She has a very innocent yet fierce personality.

, Ali usually has an innocent sweet smile, when she's luring people in or trying to get something or even when lying. She also has a very fierce and direct frown.

, Ali is smart - maybe not smart like Spencer, but she is definitely smart. You don't have to be a complete geek, but study, do your homework, and keep up on coursework.

, Know people and try to know everything about them. It could be useful when your talking to them. Practice your smart comebacks. Ali never gives up before saying a comeback and getting her point through.

, Ali acts like she's 19 when she's 15. So act like a couple of years older than you really are. Also, if you act older, older kids will want to hang out with you, etc. Play hard to get, hard to be. If people think you don't need them as friend they will want to follow you. People will envy you.

, Go to football games, be a cheerleader, do something like that, Alison has an amazing social life, So she has like a billion friends. To keep up on the social events you need to go to them and be involved to make friends and to show yourself off.

, Alison thrives on manipulating people to turn the situation to her advantage. Be sure to exploit other people's weaknesses and insecurities to crush their will to defy you or get them to think the sun shines out of your ass no matter what you do or say.

, Alison is perfect at this she knows how to make people sweat. She also knows how to to break people up to get what she wants.

You may find it helpful to know lines of the other parts that are your prompts too.;
, Make sure that you know where you are supposed to be on stage and when. Sometimes you may need to pay attention to the lighting so you can be in the right place and the right time for a certain effect to work.

, That way, you can move around them comfortably and confidently.

, Make sure you can perform all your required actions wearing it. Consider using your costume to help you act. An example of this would be having a physically heavy or weighted costume for a character who is lumbering and slow.

, Good stage actors can whisper loudly enough for the entire audience to hear. If you are using microphones and sound equipment, practice with them and get to know what works.

, Stage make up may not look good close up; you might even look false, fake, over made up, tarty, clown-like or a variety of other unflattering looks close up! It's how the make up looks to the audience that counts.

, Be that person on stage, even when you don't have lines or specific directions. Think as your character the whole time you are on stage, but don't overdo it and upstage any one else.

, ( Back of the room where you are performing for example. ) This will take your mind off the people that are watching and make you feel less uncomfortable acting in front of a small crowd or even a massive crowd.

, Remember not too talk too quickly; the people watching might not understand what you are meant to be saying.

, Don't actually tell them of course, but just give them an idea. If you are acting out a play that is on television, watch it over and over again (but remember that stage plays and TV can be very different and the acting techniques used differ considerably). Spot your role and make note of their facial expressions and how they talk throughout the film. You could do this by recording it, taking pictures or writing down and drawing key parts that you could use. Try them out all the time: in the mirror, at school, in the bath, at bedtime and basically whenever you've got the chance. Some people might be deft so remember to make lots of mouth movements and not that simple groan of 'Do I have to do the washing and do my homework, can't I just do it later?'

,,, There are lots of schools to improve your acting.

,, This can give you a feedback on your acting and later you can improvise on your mistakes if any.

, Just ask yourself about the difference between you and your role. What is it? Age, gender, personality, etc.? Think on it a while and then try to get these changes on you. Your acting will be more natural.

, You may struggle with this.

, Be more natural. Emotions, speech and gestures play a very important role in this.

, This can fit the lines in your subconscious mind so that you will speak up next line more fluently.

, Don't just cram the dialogues. See what each dialogue means.

, Don't get distracted while learning dialogues and keep your full focus on the script.

Buy a monologue book and start trying out parts by yourself.,
Take acting classes, write and act in some homemade skits, or try out for a low-key role.,
Use pacing and volume to match the energy of the scene.,
Reduce your character to their defining desire.,
Step into the shoes of your character by relating your own experience to their emotions.",How to Get Started in Acting1," Found at most bookstores or for free online, monologues are to actors what long runs are to track athletes. You may not ever use most of these monologues, but the practice is invaluable. Read over each one, then make up a character to fit the speech as you read. You should pick one or two and practice them over and over, honing your skills. Once you feel like you have them down, move on to more. Each one will help you train new emotions and characters.Ask yourself-- what does the speaker of the monologue look like? Keep it simple for now -- what do they do with their hands when they talk, for example?
What is the key emotion of the speech? What lines do you need to ""sell"" to make this emotion obvious?
What is the progression of the monologue -- is the speaker in a different emotional or intellectual place by the end of the speech?;
, The best way to practice acting is to get out there and act. While you will absolutely be nervous, classes and small productions are great, low-risk ways to get over your stage butterflies. Everyone is in the same boat as you, and you will all learn and grow together. Look online, check your school's courses and extra-curricular activities, or just make your own videos to start acting.

You can study and learn by yourself all you want but acting is, by its very nature, a performance. It requires an audience -- and you have to get comfortable performing in front of one, even if it is just the internet.

, Likely, your first instinct is to nervously rush through the lines, trying to match the emotion without changing pacing and volume. But the way you say your words is the essence of acting, not the words themselves. Pauses, bursts of volume, sudden rushes through difficult phrases, and other pacing tricks are what make characters appear human. Think about how you naturally talk when feeling certain emotions, such as:



Nervous or fearful characters usually rush the words out.

Mad, angry, or upset characters their voice and often slow down speech to make a point. But they can also get faster when overflowing with anger.

Happy/excited characters tend to speak with an even volume, and quick tempo, or they raise volume as the speech goes on.
Pacing can, and should, change within scenes. Your character might start calm and cool, then get more frantic as the scene develops. Your speech must reflect this., Every character has desire -- it is the basis of plot and story. Your character wants something, and they decide to try and get it. What, exactly, do they want? It seems like a basic question, but that's because you must answer it to learn how to act. What, above all, motivates your character? Love? Greed? Power? Fate/Destiny? Hunger? Any of these motivations can help an actor make a memorable character, even something as simple as hunger (look at the multiple movies of Harold and Kumar, for a silly example).

Great actors find glimmers of this motivation in every single
Characters, especially well-written ones, can have conflicting, changing, or nuanced motivations. Portraying these scenes, when motivations shift, is often your character's biggest moment., You've likely never saved the planet from a last-second alien invasion, but you may have desperately worked against a deadline to finish a project in time. While the events are completely different, the feelings of worry, rushing, steely determination, and passion all carry over. Great actors find the humanity in the script -- the basic human emotions that everyone recognizes, and channel those feelings into their performance.

Once you make a decision for a character, commit to it. If you feel like their lines are sad, slow, and thoughtful, you should feel confident in your decision. Do whatever it takes to get those emotions across.

"
"
Think about your character's physical posture and habits, not just their lines.,
Pay attention to your reactions to other characters' lines, not just when it is ""your turn."",
Think about the point of emphasis in each line or paragraph.,
Be consistent on stage or set to making shooting a breeze.,
Take improvisation classes to improve on-stage reactions and acting.",How to Get Started in Acting2," Human beings are enormously complex, and much of our communication comes from body language, not just words. So what is your character's posture like? Do they command the room or slouch in the corners? Do they move around or stay very still? Do they get really engaged when talking, or remain reserved and aloof?

You don't need to come up with unique tics and traits for every character, as this will be overkill for many parts. But you do need to think about how they stand, sit, and speak. Basic posture is easy to study if you're unsure -- walk into any restaurant or public setting and just people watch
Separate yourself from the character. You might not use your hands when talking, but an older Italian character couldn't stop using them., Great actors remain in character the entire scene, feeding off their co-actors to keep the scene alive even when they're not talking. Knowing the other actor's lines and being ready to respond to them makes the entire performance better, and helps you stay in character.


Real people (not characters being acted) stay in the moment. Don't think about your next scene or a flubbed line from before -- clue right into the present moment.
Watch Charlie Day in the show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia for a funny example of acting reactions. Even when he's in the background, he keeps up the nervous, unpredictable energy that makes his character (and the actor) so popular.

, Where you stress words matters as much as how fast you say them. Take the simple line, ""I love you."" You can stress all three words and get three different sounding sentences -- ""I love you."" (about ""me""); ""I love you"" (about discovering love); or ""I love you,"" (about them). You, as an actor, need to decide which of these moments is worth the most attention.

If in doubt, talk to the director. They may have a vision for the line or the character's arc that you need to mesh with.
Emphasis is also important in monologues and paragraphs. In a long speech there is almost always a moment where the mood, subject, or idea evolves or switches. Find this point and make it a strong transition for your character.

, ""Blocking"" is where an actor stands, where they move, and when they do it. For film sets, this is usually meticulously mapped out to aid cameras, lights, and sound crews. It is essential that you stick to this blocking, otherwise you can ruin the entire shot, so don't try to improvise something new on the spot. Even theatrical actors need to stick to blocking consistently, as your movements dictate other actors' movements and some stage effects.

Good actors rehearse and find the role before shooting. That way they can show up and consistently hit marks and lines instead of trying to figure it out on the fly., An improv class teaches you the art of acting in the present. To be good at improv, the character will always appear naturally, because it is happening in real time and not dictated by a script. This will help build the essential skill of reacting to the events in real time and not reading off a page. It also raises your on-stage awareness of other lines, actors, and props.Many acting classes offer improv as a warm-up or a unit, so you can often get a little improv practice in with a ""classic"" acting class.
When improvising, focus on building up the scene. Basically, this means always agreeing to your other actors, then adding a twist. To practice, work on responding to each line with a ""Yes! and also..."""

Take all the parts you can, including commercials and student films, as you get started.,
Take some good, clean headshots of yourself.,
Audition for an acting agency in your town.,
Put together a reel of the best parts you've played.,
Practice ""cold readings"" to kill at your auditions.,
Consider moving to a larger city like LA or New York.",How to Get Started in Acting3," There is far more acting work out in the world than you think. Most of it, however, won't see a movie theater or TV screen anytime soon. However, as a beginner, this is fine. You can grow experience and your resume and still get paid. Some good places to find gigs include:

Craigslist
Backstage.com
College film departments

, Headshots are your calling card. They are simple photos taken from your shoulder up showcasing your ""look,"" which casting directors use to make audition lists. If you're willing to drop the money, have them done professionally. Otherwise, you can call up a friend and shoot your own, remembering a few key tips:

Use a plain background and simple, flattering clothes.
Showcase your entire head and shoulders. Don't turn away or crop the shot to be ""artful.""
Bring in extra lamps and lights to make sure you are evenly lit.
Take a few smiling, a few serious, and a few in between. You never know your best look.

, More often not, all you have to do is send in some headshots, and you'll get called for an audition if they're looking for your look. You'll show up and read a short monologue, after which they'll decide if you are a good fit for their agency. Agents are essential if you want to be a professional actor -- they are the middlemen between filmmakers and you, and most opportunities are sent to agencies, not the general public.

, A reel is just a collection of scenes and shots from other acting gigs, edited together on the computer to show off your acting in 2-3 minutes. Not all gigs require a reel, but having one will greatly increase your chance of getting gigs. When picking clips, use the ones that show off you the most in various roles -- monologues, dialogue, and action. Some other tips include:

Use the most high-quality footage you have, especially up front. Homemade footage, unless it has high quality, is generally not a good idea.
Keep it short -- no more than 4-5 minutes. Even shorter is better.
Update this video as you get more roles, keeping it current.
Put your contact information and name at the beginning and end., Cold reads are when you're handed the script and expected to act it out immediately after. Sometimes you get a few minutes to read over it, sometimes you just have to get started. To practice, grab the old a book of monologues, pick up a book, or snag a newspaper story and start reading out loud. Practice both reading from scratch and taking 1-2 minutes to prepare., To really make it as an actor, you need to be in a location with lots of acting gigs. While there will be more competition in hubs like LA or NY, almost all major productions cast in these locations. Once you're comfortable with your skills, acting in local commercials, plays, or videos, you'll have to decide if you want to be a"

Apply for full Equity membership.",How to Get an Equity Card2," It’s possible to gain membership to the Actors’ Equity Association as a nonunion actor.

, Annual participation in an acting union is considered good experience, and will put you on the fast track to joining the AEA.

Work for a production covered by SAG-AFTRA.Take advantage of the loophole that allows such productions to hire nonunion performers.,
Join another union.,
Work within the United States.,
Seek consultation if you are under 18.",How to Get a SAG Card2," Audition for either principal or background roles, regardless of your status. If hired, begin your application process with the union. However, be aware that rules stipulate that:Nonunion performers can only be hired if they show skills or qualities that are uniquely vital to a specific role.
If they do, they can only win that role if no available union member possesses the same characteristics.
Once hired, nonunion performers are obligated to join SAG-AFTRA if the production lasts longer than 30 days.

, If you are unable to find work as a nonunion performer in a production covered by SAG-AFTRA (or if you simply wish to be protected by a union in the meantime), seek membership with another organization. Maintain your membership with them for at least twelve months before applying to SAG-AFTRA. Additionally, make sure that you work at least one paying job in a principal role during that time in order to qualify as eligible. Other unions recognized by SAG-AFTRA include:ACTRA (The Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists)
AEA (Actors' Equity Association)
AGMA (American Guild of Musical Artists)
AGVA (American Guild of Variety Artists)

, Gain your credentials through American productions and unions, rather than those abroad. If you have prior acting experience in other countries, consider it null and void. Although exceptions are sometimes made, expect SAG-AFTRA to regard such qualifications as invalid.If you do obtain acting work in the United States, but are not a U.S. citizen or resident alien, make sure you have the proper visa entitling you to work here.
Be aware that such visas are granted solely by project and immediately expire at the end of that production.

, SAG-AFTRA welcomes minors as members, but expect conditions of membership to vary according to your home state’s laws. Utilize the union’s resources to research rules that may affect you. Do any one or more of the following:Visit https://www.sagaftra.org/content/young-performers to learn general issues facing young actors as well as state-specifc statutes.

Focus on background roles.,
Utilize alternate forms of media.,
Be discerning.",How to Get a SAG Card3," If you are a nonunion performer, concentrate your efforts on winning roles as an extra, rather than a principal character. Save yourself time and energy by avoiding auditions for lead roles, which are far more likely to go to union members regardless of your talent. Instead, seek work in the background, which may still entitle you for eligibility with SAG-AFTRA. Increase your chances of eligibility by focusing on roles that:Require at least three days of employment.
Involve working in harsh conditions or environments.
Share scenes with only a small number of other performers.
Are not sought after by union members (i.e., productions filmed outside of actor-hotbeds like New York or Los Angeles).

, Take advantage of SAG-AFTRA’s New Media Department, which covers less traditional forms of content. Seek roles for web productions rather than TV or film. Benefit from their more relaxed rules regarding nonunion performers.With TV and films, SAG-AFTRA requires the production to always hire union members whenever possible, unless special circumstances demand the use of nonunion performers.
With web content, the production is free to hire nonunion performers for additional background roles once they have filled the first ten with union members.

, Do not assume that you will be considered eligible for membership just because you have been hired and registered by the production company. Anticipate the union researching both your role and the production in order to verify that you are indeed eligible.Choose work that appears to demand actual acting on your part, rather than just filling a space in the background.


When SAG-AFTRA researches your role, they specifically try to determine whether that role only exists as a favor in order to make the actor eligible.
So if you have a choice between, say, a low-paying job as Zombie Extra #5 way out in the middle of nowhere and a higher-paying job right around the corner as Customer #11 in the background of your friend’s workplace sitcom, choose the zombie role.

Complain of swelling in your breasts.,
Explain that you're bloated.,
Pretend to have mood swings.,
Complain about menstrual cramps.,
Talk about lower back pain.,
Talk to someone.,
Ask your mom when her own period started.,
Look for your breasts to develop.,
Notice the growth of pubic hair.,
Check your armpits for hair.,
Notice some vaginal discharge.,
Observe changes in your complexion.,
Prepare an emergency kit for your first period.,
Ask an older woman for help.",How to Fake Your Period," One of the signs of getting your period is that your breasts may swell. They may feel heavier than usual, or become painful to touch.The changing hormones in your body affect your breasts during your period.
Usually this swelling occurs before your period. If you're faking being on your period, you might complain about the way your breasts ached a few days earlier.;
, Many girls and women experience a sense of being puffy and bloated around the time of their periods. When you're on your period, your body will naturally retain more water.Some signs of being bloated are puffiness around your middle. You might complain that your clothes feel tight, and that your jeans hard to close.
You might say that you feel full, and don't feel like eating.
Usually the bloating is done by the 3rd day of your period, so don't go on too long with your pretense.

, Hormones that come with your period can have an extreme effect on your mood, causing you to dive into sullen depression for no apparent reason. If you want to fake being on your period, pretend to be moody and depressed.Other symptoms are feeling uncharacteristically anxious, irritable, or confused.
Don't overdo it! You don't want your parents to be so worried about your mood that they take you to the doctor.

, Menstrual cramps happen in your abdominal area, and are caused by the muscles of the uterus contracting. The contracting uterus pushes the blood out, causing the visible signs of a period. If you are faking your period, talk about the pain of the cramps.Your pretend cramps might feel either sharp and stabbing, or just like a dull ache.
It's not a good idea to take medication, since you're not really experiencing pain. Instead, just explain that you need to rest.
You might gently massage your abdomen, explaining that this helps the cramps.

, During your period, your lower back may start to ache. This is due to the same menstrual cramping that causes feelings of pain in the abdomen. Pain in your lower back due to your period is usually a dull achey feeling.


Again, it's still not a good idea to take medication, since you're not really in pain. However, it won't hurt you to put a hot compress on your back if someone insists you do something to feel better.
Other things that you can suggest include taking a hot bath, or resting. These are recommended treatments for lower back cramps.

, There's nothing wrong with faking your period, but it might not solve the real problem you have. Talking to an older woman might be helpful, and you might be able to solve your problem in another way.For example, if you feel like you need to fake your period to impress your friends, it's possible that you don't have strong friendships. A real friend accepts you just as you are.
If you are faking your period to get out of gym class, talking with someone can help you figure out what it is about this class that is so dreadful that you have to lie to get out of it. Is the teacher unprofessional? Do you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious doing the gym activities? Talking with someone you trust about this situation may help you figure out what's really going on.

, If you're faking your period because your friends have all started, you probably want to know when your own is likely to start. One way to find out is to ask your mom, because many times your own biological clock will be similar.If your mom started her period at the age of 12, your own period is likely start within a year of your 12th birthday.
You might start to get your period as young as 8 or 9, or you might be as old as 16.

, Your period usually will start within 2 years of the time your breasts buds appear. This means that your nipples will become raised, no longer laying flat on the surface of your chest.The breast buds appear because of fat, tissue and milk ducts growing beneath the nipples, in preparation for providing milk to a newborn child.
Your breasts can take from 1-4 years to grow into a rounded, adult shape from the time your breast buds appear.

, Usually the hair that appears below your lower stomach and between your legs is soft and light at first. Then, over time, it will grow darker and curlier.Your period will usually start between 1-2 years from the time your pubic hair starts to grow.
Some adult women choose to shave their pubic hair, but this isn't usually recommended for young girls because this is such a sensitive region.

, Like the hairs in your pubic area, your underarm hairs might seem light and soft at first, before growing darker and curly. You'll probably notice pubic hair growing first, and then hair beneath your arms.Many girls choose to shave these hairs off with a razor. There are no health reasons to do this, however, so it's up to you to decide what you prefer.
Underarm hair usually comes towards the end of puberty.

, If you notice yellow or white stains on your underpants, this is likely a natural fluid that helps your vagina stay clean and moist. You will most likely get your period within a year of noticing signs of discharge.The discharge should not smell bad.
If you have itching, or if the discharge is foul-smelling, you might have an infection and need to see a doctor.

, Most girls start to notice oilier patches of skin around their face, due to hormonal changes in their bodies. Pimples and acne might also appear on your skin.Make sure you're washing your face at least once daily with gentle soap and warm water. Don't scrub it, or you may cause scarring.
Your doctor may prescribe treatment for acne if it's bad enough.

, Because no one knows exactly when she'll get her first period, it's a good idea to prepare a kit to keep with you just in case it comes. An emergency kit should contain everything that you need to take care of your menstrual flow when it arrives, including a small pantyliner, a pad, and a pair of clean underwear.Having a kit will also be handy if you want to fake having a period, because other people can see that you're prepared.
If you don't have your emergency kit when you get your first period, putting some toilet paper in the crotch of your underwear can serve as a temporary fix until you can get a real pad.
A school nurse or clinic will usually have free pads that you can use. Some public restrooms have dispenser to sell single pads or tampons.

, If you're trying to figure out more about what having a period is like, ask an older woman who you trust. This might be your mom, your aunt, a teacher, or even an older sister. Even though conversations about private subjects like periods aren't common, the truth is that every woman has gone through the process of getting her period. She'll probably be happy to talk with you about it.If you're not sure how to start the conversation, consider saying something like, ""Can I ask you about something? I am wondering about getting my period....""
Make sure you're asking her at a time when you have some privacy, and when you're not rushing to go somewhere else.

Close your eyes and imagine a sad event.,
Block out other thoughts and focus.,
Pause for a few moments to let the tears collect.,
Release the flood.",How to Fake Cry1," This method is used by many actors who are able identify so strongly with the sad situation they are portraying that they cry with tears that seem to flow from true emotions. You can emulate this technique by simply thinking of something very sad, so sad that it makes tears spring to your eyes. It's different for every person, but here are a few examples:


The death of someone quite close to you.
A really bad breakup
Something you aren't able to talk about with people
Being bullied
A Sad Moment You have been through.
A horrible event that happened.
The death of a pet or something close to you.
Old sad memories or someone you really miss.
The thought of summer ending and the next school year beginning.;
, In order for this to work, you have to really focus on the sad thought and temporarily convince yourself that it's true. Think of the inevitability of this event occurring; if it hasn't yet, it will. All good things come to an end, and life is as sad as it is happy. Focus, focus, until you feel tears begin to flood your eyelids.


Crinkle your brow and frown. Composing your face with the sad expression it takes on when you naturally cry will cause you to feel sadder.
Droop your head down a bit. This will give you the appearance of being sad, but since your face is obscured, you'll have a bit of time to get the tears going without your face being so closely scrutinized. You don't want people to see your face go from blank to bawling in an instant - they'll be suspicious.

, Don't open your eyes yet; wait until you've got a good collection of tears under your closed lids. A slight dribble of water could be mistaken for sweat instead of tears. Continue dwelling on the sad thought.

, You'll know the method worked when you feel your throat constrict and have the urge to let the tears flow. Open your eyes so that they stream down your cheeks. Remember to keep the expression on your face downcast and sad. Try to hold onto the thought for as long as you need to, until you're finished crying. Don't get too carried away, though - the point is to fake cry, not get completely overcome with emotion! Stay in control.

"
"
Open your eyes wide.,
Hold them open if necessary.,
Close your eyes tight to push out the tears.",How to Fake Cry2," This technique is good if you just need to look a little teary, but you don't necessarily need a waterworks display. As the air dries the surface of your eyes, your eyelids will want to blink to moisten them. Don't let them close. The longer you hold them open, the more tears you'll produce.


Fan your eyes to produce more wind and dry your eyes out faster.
If you're in a dry, dusty area, even better. Your eyes will produce tears to clear the dust away.
Be careful not to let anything dangerous get in your eye. If the wind is whipping sand around, for example, you could cause eye damage.

, If your impulse to blink is unbearably strong, you can hold your eyes open with your fingers. This doesn't exactly look natural, so you probably don't want to use this technique if you're trying to actually fool someone with your fake crying.


Don't hold your eyes open manually for more than a few seconds; again, your eyelids blink to protect your eyes, and you don't want to prevent this reflex from happening to the point where you could cause yourself harm.
Be sure not to touch your eyeball with your fingers; eyes can easily become infected when they come into contact with dirt and bacteria found on hands.

, After you've held your eyes open and let the tears collect a bit, close your eyes to squeeze them out. You should have enough water to produce one or two good-sized drops.

"
"
Get some methylated chapstick or chest rub.,
Put some rub on a clean tissue.,
Rub a dab under each eye.,
Take a number of deep breaths to also make it sound like you're crying.

",How to Fake Cry3," This petroleum jelly-textured substance is sold at drugstores, and is commonly used by people with colds to help open the sinuses and nostrils.

, You can put some of the rub on a tissue well before you plan to fake cry. Place it in a plastic baggie and put it in your pocket or purse so that it's accessible when the moment arrives.

, When it's time to cry, pretend that you are overcome with emotion, then use the tissue to apply just a little of the mentholated rub under the bottom lash line of each eye. Its proximity to your eyeballs will cause your eyes to begin producing tears. Be very careful not to get any of the rub inside your eyes, as this will cause pain and a burning sensation.


Keep the tissue near your eyes until they begin producing tears. It may take 30 seconds or so. In the meantime, make crying noises.
The mentholated rub has the added benefit of looking shiny on your skin, so even if you don't produce a lot of tears, your eyes will look wet.

,"
"
Get a fresh habanero or jalapeno pepper.,
Eat the pepper right before you're ready to cry.,
Discreetly eat more pepper to continue the act.",How to Fake Cry4," If you're extremely sensitive to peppers, a seedless jalapeno might be strong enough to cause your eyes to start watering. If you're a fire eater, you'll need a hot one.


Use gloves when you handle hot peppers. It's well known that touching a hot pepper and then touching your eye will cause irritation and tearing. This means you could skip the next step and simply touch the inside of a pepper and put your finger in your eye, but the pain probably isn't worth it.
If you don't have fresh peppers on hand, habanero or another hot sauce might do the trick.
Chopping a white onion is another good substitute for hot peppers. Just make sure it's white, since this type of onion emits the chemicals that cause people to cry.

, Remember that a little goes a long way, especially when it comes to habaneros. Eat just a little chunk of the pepper, letting it roll over your tongue and against the roof of your mouth before swallowing. If you don't feel your face turning hot, eat some more.


As always, furrow your brow and frown to make your fake crying act seem believable. In this case you should keep your mouth closed so the person for whom you're performing doesn't see the pepper chunks inside.
Try not to make your chewing motions obvious. If necessary, you may need to chew the pepper before you face the person watching you ""cry.""

, If your face stops producing sweat and tears before you're ready for the scene to end, find a way to eat another chunk of pepper. You might cover your mouth with a handkerchief while you bring the piece to your mouth, or excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and eat it there before returning with fresh tears.

"
"
Squirt eye drops in your eyes.,
Affect the right expression.",How to Fake Cry5," Pull the skin below your eye down with one finger, and use your other hand to squirt some drops into your bottom lid. This method produces tears that look quite real, but getting the timing right is tricky, since you have to bring the bottle to your eye right before you want the tears to flow. It's a great method to use if you're fake crying for a photo shoot, but it's not very effective if you're trying to fool someone in person.

, Since you don't have to work hard for the tears using this method, you'll need to make an extra effort to look like you're crying. Be sure that your eyes, forehead, and mouth look like they do when you cry.


If appropriate, try ""crying"" tears of joy instead of tears of sadness when you use the eye drops method. This way you won't have to work as hard to look sad; you may find it easier to look ecstatically happy.
If you can find an excuse to turn away for a minute, put the drops in your eyes when the person for whom you're performing can't see your face. You'll have to be quite sly to pull this off.

Make a downward curving shape with your mouth.,
Furrow your brow.,
Raise your upper lip slightly.,
Subtly jut your lower lip forward.,
Glare intensely at the subject of your anger.,
For extreme anger, widen your eyes and flare your nostrils.,
Make a downward curving shape with your mouth.,
Raise your eyebrows.,
Make an open, vulnerable look with your eyes.,
Cast your gaze downward.,
For extreme sadness, tear up or cry.,
Observe (or imagine) something displeasing.,
Practice.,
Learn from the best.",How to Frown," The single facial expression that most people associate with frowning is a downward curve of the mouth. To make this downward curve, keep your lips together and pull the corners of your mouth back and down using the muscles at the front of your cheeks. You'll want to avoid pulling harshly, as this can create a bizarre, frog-like appearance. This is a difficult muscle movement to isolate, but, luckily, it is much easier in conjunction with the other facial movements that make a frown.


This ""upside-down smile"" expression is so emblematic of the act of frowning that it's often used on its own to symbolize the entire expression (for example, in the case of frowning emoticons like :(, which use just representations of the eyes and mouth to express displeasure).;
, Next, contract the muscles in the front of your forehead to give your brow a furrowed or ""bunched-up"" look. Combined with curving your mouth downward, his should have the natural effect of giving you a slight sneer, squinted eyes, and hooked, angry-looking eyebrows. If you're having trouble doing this, try ""flexing"" the muscles between your eyebrows in the mirror, making them as thick and tight as possible.


This action is important to make your expression distinguishable from a ""sad"" frown. Without a furrowed brow, the other parts of a frown can sometimes look ambiguous, but with a harsh, furrowed brow, there is no mistaking your emotions.

, As you frown, try to ever-so-slightly raise your upper lip. Pull somewhat gently so that your lips stay together. This has the subtle but noticeable effect of increasing the intensity of your expression. Don't lift your lip so high that you expose your teeth - this can make you look disgusted or confused.


To make a sneer, a related expression, exaggerate the motion of raising your upper lip. You may even want to lift your upper lip to the point that your lips are no longer together and your teeth can be seen. Sneers are useful for expressing a combination of anger and disgust and are best attempted with an arrogant attitude.

, As you adjust your upper lip, push your lower lip forward just a little. Discretion is key here - the change in position should be very, very subtle. Be careful not to extend your bottom lip too far, or you'll give yourself a bizarre pouting expression and will have a hard time making people take your anger seriously.

, Like all facial expressions, the emotion conveyed in a good frown is concentrated in the eyes. If you're really mad, show that you mean it by shooting a red-hot glare at whatever you're frowning at. Narrow your gaze by bringing your cheeks up slightly. Tilt your head very slightly forward. Together, these actions will have the effect of making your eyes give an intense, fiery look from under your brow.

, Sometimes, normal, everyday frowns just aren't sufficient to display the powerful, wrathful anger that's welling up inside you. To make a truly fearsome scowl, open your eyes wide, exposing their whites, and flare your nostrils while you perform the rest of the steps above - furrowing your brow, curving your mouth downward, and so on.


You may also want to tighten your neck and facial muscles to add to your expression of anger. Tense your neck muscles to make the tendons in your neck visible while simultaneously furrowing your brow and turning your mouth downward with greater intensity than you normally would. This tight, ""tense"" expression gives the impression of visceral, nearly uncontrollable anger.

, The shape of the mouth in an angry frown and in a sad frown is very similar. Turn the corners of your mouth downward, pulling with the muscles in the corners of your mouth and at the fronts of your cheeks.


Normally, when making sad frowns, you'll want to keep your lips together, but when expressing extreme sadness, you may part your lips in a sort of sad ""gasping"" gesture. If you open your mouth for crying, it should be roughly square.

, Similar to angry frowns, sad frowns involve the use of the muscles in the forehead and brow. However, their exact use differs somewhat. Rather than bunching up your brow and forehead around the space between your eyebrows, you'll want to instead use your forehead muscles to lift the inner corners of your eyebrows. This should have the effect of making you look dismayed, put-down, or crushed - in other words, sad.


This is a somewhat tricky facial expression to intentionally recreate. If you're having difficulty, try lifting the area of skin between your eyebrows upward by tightening your forehead muscles.

, Expressions of sadness represent an outpouring of inner emotion that's causing pain. To make your sad frown authentic, try to channel this inner pain into your eyes with a look of vulnerability. Allow your eyelids to hang loosely over your eyes, but don't let them fall so far that they appear droopy. Try to adopt a plaintive look in your eye as you do so.


A good rule of thumb is that, when making an angry frown, your eyes should have a tight, narrow, focused appearance, whereas when making a sad frown, they should be looser and more open.

, Accompany your sad frown with changes in your body language that complement the dejected impression you're trying to make. For instance, let your eyelids hang loosely over your eyes and look off to the side or at the ground, rather than at what's right in front of you. This should make you look glum and defeated, as if whatever is making you sad is so overwhelming that you can't bear to confront it directly.


You may also want to try slouching your shoulders forward. Shifting from a normal, erect posture to one that's less well-supported furthers the impression that your sadness is preventing you from being your normal self.

, While it's possible for a good actor to recreate an expression of extreme anger simply by moving his facial muscles in the right ways, it's more difficult to recreate extreme sadness without the addition of tears. Any sad frown will be made more convincing if it's accompanied with crying. This can be quite difficult to fake, so you may be more successful if you're experiencing genuine sadness while attempting to do so.


Crying on command is a skill that's the subject of countless online guides. For instance, for more information on crying on command, you might want to try wikiHow's How to Cry on the Spot


, It's easier to recreate expressions of displeasure if you have something to be displeased about. Putting genuine emotion behind your frown almost always makes it much more convincing, so fuel your negative emotions by exposing yourself to something that you hate. You can also try simply thinking about this thing if you'd like to avoid actually having to deal with it. Try thinking about your S.O. leaving you for someone else, your term paper getting accidentally deleted, or another similar disaster - whatever makes you angry or sad.


For instance, if you hate it when your housemates leave their dirty dishes for you to wash, you might want build up some fiery anger in your heart by going to the kitchen and looking at the overflowing sink or even just thinking hard about them leaving their plates there without washing them.

, Being able to make a great frown spontaneously is a skill that needs honing just like any other. For the best frowns, consistently devote time to practice. Preferably, you should practice in front of a mirror, though, if you've got your expressions down pat and are just trying to imprint them in your muscle memory, practice without a mirror can suffice.


Professional actors actually devote lots of time and energy to practicing certain facial expressions in an effort to make their performances more realistic. Some acting classes may offer specific exercises intended to enhance an actor's ability to perform various facial expressions on command, including frowns.

, Certain famous people are renowned for the ability (and frequency) with which they frown. Study these peoples' frowns to get a sense for the minor quirks and subtleties that can distinguish one memorable frown from another. Below are just a few people known for their frowns, scowls, and sneers:


Robert De Niro

Don't sweat small mistakes.",How to Do a Relaxation Exercise for Acting," Breathing clears your mind and sends oxygen flowing to your brain. Stand up straight and take deep breaths from low down in your abdomen. Breathe in for a slow count to seven, then breathe out for eleven counts. Repeat this slow, rhythmic pattern until you lose the jittery feeling.


Lying down for this exercise can help you relax, but remain standing if you feel nauseous.;
, This will loosen your muscles, causing you to feel a little more calm.

, Some actors love to get their body moving before they go on stage or get in front of a camera. If you're mired in your own thoughts, a little exercise can be a great distraction. Go to a private location and shake out all that nervous energy.


If you're about to perform, don't do anything that will make you breathe heavily.

, Many anxiety sufferers swear by acupressure techniques. Gently pressing the underside of your wrist is supposed to be particularly useful for soothing an upset stomach.

, It may sound silly, but multiple studies report an increase in confidence after a big, powerful pose. For example, place your legs apart, your arms akimbo, and hold your head up. Strike this pose in a mirror and tell yourself ""I got this!"" to really drive it home.

, Get your mouth limber and your voice practiced with a few quick exercises. Try repeating ""the big black bug bled black blood"" until you can say it quickly while enunciating perfectly. Lip trills can help as well.


If you're in a singing performance, warm up with additional voice exercises.

, Yes, you do need to stay within hearing range of the stage. That doesn't mean you need to be in a group of other nervous actors. Stand to the side and stay aware of your surroundings without getting tangled in other people's energy.

, Thirty seconds before you go on, take deep breaths and snap your fingers while moving your hand in a circle in front of your face. Perhaps it's just the moment of distraction from your thoughts, but this certainly helps some people focus.

, The more your prepare by memorizing and practicing your script, the easier it will be to overcome anxiety. Practice on a real stage whenever you can, so it doesn't feel as strange on the big day.

, Sweating and panicking can lead to dehydration, which may throw you off your game. Water will keep you refreshed and prepared, but don't gulp it down. Drink a small cup and wait for your stomach to settle before you pour yourself another.


Drinking warm (non-caffeinated) tea can feel particularly nice on your throat after singing or using your stage voice. Stash a mug backstage if you can.

, While you're waiting for your scene, read along to the performance with a copy of the script. This gives you something to do and makes your move onstage feel less abrupt.


It can be more difficult to remember your lines under pressure. Even a well-prepared actor can use a script to look through before she performs.

, No one delivers the perfect performance every time. New actors worry over minor slip ups much more than the audience does. If you skip a line or fumble an interaction, try to stay calm and get back on track as though it never happened. Remember, the audience doesn't know the script, and will enjoy the performance as long as you stay natural.

Sound hoarse.,
Make your voice crack and fade.,
Throw in some strained whispering when you speak.,
Cough when you talk.,
Complain about symptoms in the days leading up to your voice loss.,
Talk less than you normally would.,
Write things down to communicate.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Suck on throat lozenges.",How to Fake Losing Your Voice," One of the telltale signs of laryngitis is hoarseness, which refers to the raspy, strained quality your voice gets when you’ve used it too much.To make your voice sound raspy and gravelly, practice vibrating your vocal chords like you're croaking like a frog.Also practice making bah noises like you're a sheep, because this will also vibrate your vocal chords.
After practicing making sounds, start incorporating that same raspy quality into your speaking voice.;
, Another common thing that happens when you have laryngitis is that you'll experience unintentional changes in the volume and pitch of your voice as you speak.When you're speaking, try to make your voice crack as you say certain words, and then make your voice fade out briefly so it’s quieter than usual. Alternate between doing this and speaking in your regular (but hoarse) voice.

, In addition to the voice cracking and fading, you should also whisper more when you speak if you want to fake losing your voice. When you have laryngitis, your vocal chords will often have trouble producing sound, and you can replicate this by dropping your voice to a strained whisper intermittently as you speak.


Make sure you continue alternating between your voice cracking, fading, whispering, and speaking hoarsely at a normal volume.
When you transition between these different voice effects, try to make the transition as natural as possible so people don’t know you're forcing it.

, Laryngitis often causes a rawness in the throat and a dry throat, so it’s common for people who’ve lost their voice to cough sometimes when they speak.Don’t cough too much, but throw in a few dry coughs if you’ve been talking for a while.
A cough is created when your body forcefully expels air from the lungs, which is different from vibrating your vocal chords to create speech, meaning you can still cough if you’ve lost your voice., On top of performing different vocal effects to give the impression that you’ve lost your voice, there are also other things you can do to support your act. If you want to lay a foundation for your voice loss, complain of a sore or tickled throat and a cough one or two days prior to losing your voice.

, Regardless of what causes laryngitis, the best remedy is always resting your voice.This means that if you really had lost your voice, you'd be trying to rest it so that you could recover quicker.


Try using your body language more, such as nodding or shaking your head, instead of talking when you're communicating with someone.

, Laryngitis is often accompanied by a sore throat and coughing, and both these things can make it difficult and painful to speak. In conjunction with talking less and using your body language more, try writing things down to communicate instead of talking.


You can alternate between speaking with voice effects and writing (to rest your voice) to support the impression that you’ve got laryngitis.

, Another effective remedy for laryngitis is drinking lots of fluids, particularly water.To support your act, drink lots of water. Especially if you have to talk for an extended period, take small and frequent sips of water.

, Soothing lozenges and cough drops are common when people have lost their voice, so you can do the same to support the idea of your laryngitis.

Talk to the other person.,
Talk to your romantic partner.,
Understand the type of kiss.,
Practice the kiss.,
Imagine someone else.,
Picture your character's motivations.,
Use the tension to your advantage.,
Don't take it too seriously.",How to Do a Kissing Scene in Acting," Get to know the person you'll be kissing to make him or her more approachable. Admit that you feel awkward about the kissing scene; chance are the other person feels the same. Sharing a laugh about it or agreeing how to approach the task can reduce the pressure.;
, If you are currently in a relationship, tell your partner that you'll be kissing someone onstage. Explain that this is just a mechanical task with no romantic implications. If your partner objects, you may need to put some time in addressing jealousy.

, The script offers clues, but in the end this is up to the director. It should be clear whether you are acting out a romantic kiss, a lustful embrace, a quick welcome home kiss, or some other approach. Depending on the stage or camera setup, you may not even be required to make lip contact with the other actor.


If you have a choice, closed mouth kisses are generally preferable in a school play. Adult performers may use an open mouth to look more realistic, but tongue is going overboard.

, Kiss each other when practicing the scene. Kiss during every rehearsal. If you keep shying away or pulling an unpleasant face, set aside some time to kiss repeatedly until you are completely detached from the physical act. When the show comes around you want this to be an acting challenge like any other, not a weird, distracting moment. Once it's down to a choreographed motion, you can perform it by rote.


Make sure the other actor is on the same page. Don't start a surprise liplock if the other person was planning to fake it in rehearsal.

, If you're having trouble making the kiss look believable, imagine that you're kissing someone you want to kiss. It may help to identify attractive attributes of the other actor, or characteristics he or she shares with someone else you've kissed.


If you're acting out a passionate kiss, you can close your eyes right before it happens. This looks romantic, but may also help you imagine the scene.

, Many actors prefer to use this technique for all acting tasks, and a kissing scene is no different. Set yourself the challenge of communicating the character's emotions, thoughts, and motives to the audience.

, That nervous energy you feel is not necessarily a bad thing. Present this to the audience as passionate tension, and you can really sell the scene. Wide eyes, tense posture, a fixed gaze — your anxiety makes that so easy it's practically cheating.

, In the end, kissing someone on stage is no different than acting out a fight, a friendly conversation, or any other interaction. Your goal is to perform a role for the audience. It shouldn't have any effect on how you interact with the other actor outside of the performance.


""Don't take it seriously"" does not mean ""joke about it."" As a rule of thumb, if you wouldn't make a similar joke about any other scene in the play, don't say it.

Work on mimicking vowels, which are usually the way to get an accent.,
Drop syllables and words like your subject.,
Find the voice's ""location"" to get your pitch right every time.,
Make a list of the person's most famous words and phrases.,
Think about speech patterning and pacing to pull it all together.",How to Do Impersonations of People1," Think of the Boston ""ar"" in words like car or park (pronounced ""cahh"" or ""pahh-k""), or the long, strong ""aye"" sound in the Australian ""A"" (""good d-AYE, m-AYE-t""). Pinning down vowels will help turn every word quickly into an impression, and is the most obvious way to throw your voice.


Does your subject extend the vowels out, our are they short and quick?
Do they ""replace"" vowels with other vowel sounds? For example, some Spanish speakers turn an ""i"" into a long ""eeeee"" sound.;
, For example, a southerner generally omits the G at the end of ""-ing"" words, so ""going"" sounds more like ""goin'."" American speakers from across the country drop syllables in the center of words, like ""average"" (""av-reg""), so keep an eye out for these little word shortenings.While not all accents and tones of voice will drop words or syllables, you can usually find some variation or spin on common words in strong accents/voices.

, Most impersonations won't be in your natural vocal ""range,"" meaning you'll have to speak either lower or higher to get it right. If this is confusing, sing a very high note to yourself and then a really low note. With the high note, notice how your voice vibrates in your head, but the low note vibrates in your chest. Using these two marks as baselines, figure out where you need your voice to come from for the accent. Once you get the pitch right, make a mental note where the voice ""comes from.""If you're performing an impression live, you don't want to make people wait while you ""find"" the accent. Locating where the voice comes from is a good way to gain consistency., If you're impersonating Arnold Schwarzenegger, you better have an ""Hasta la vista, baby,"" saved up somewhere. If you're impersonating Bernie Sanders, say ""percent"" (pronounced ""perthent"" with a lisp). If you're talking about Donald Trump, the word ""huge"" (pronounced ""yuuuge"") should be prominent. People worth impersonating usually have big, colorful vocabularies and recognizable phrases -- make sure you use them.


Are there phrases the subject is commonly associated with, even if they don't really use them that often in real life? For example, a good Michael Jackson impersonation must have a high-pitched ""heee-heee!""
What common words do they substitute out? Southeastern Americans, for example, frequently use ""fixin'"" in place of ""getting ready to,"" such as ""I'm fixin' to get something to eat.""

, This isn't so much what is said or the accent used, but how the words come out. Consider Sacha Baron Cohen's famous Borat character: while you could get the accent down, the impersonation isn't complete until you get his phrasing correct, such as ""what is up, vanilla face,"" instead of ""what's up, vanilla face."" It seems small, but forgetting to contract ""it is"" is a common mistake of foreigners, making it an essential detail for a good impression of the fictional Kazakhstani citizen. Some things to consider include:


Does the subject speak slowly or do they rush the words out? Pacing is important!
Where do they place pauses or emphasis? To see this in the extreme, check out a William Shatner or Christopher Walken impersonation, as both actors have extremely unique pauses in their speech patterns."
"
Mimic and exaggerate the subject's general body language.,
Watch a person's hands as they talk, using them to capture their speaking habits.,
Keep an eye out for facial tics and common expressions.,
Use your clothing to imply the person's profession or claim to fame when possible.,
Think about one strong or unique prop that your subject might have.",How to Do Impersonations of People2," If you're impersonating a powerful, confident figure, like Bill Clinton or Idris Elba, you'll want to stand up straight, chest puffed out and chin up. If you're after a lazy or chilled-out impersonation, like The Dude or Cheech and Chong, sag your shoulders and move slowly. Instead of trying to perfectly mimic the person's unique body language, take their general mood or personality and use it get a rough approximation your audience can recognize.


If you've got an energetic subject (Kanye West, Robin Williams, Tom Cruise, etc.), be sure to keep moving and speak quickly.
Note and incorporate any big, broad, or uniquely personal gestures. A Michael Jackson impersonation, for example, would benefit greatly from a spin and crotch grab.

, One of the best ways to easily mimic a person's movements is to stick to the hands, as everyone has slightly different habits when speaking. Broadly speaking, big and energetic personalities (or Italians) move their hands all the time when talking, while quieter folks tend to keep them down. Politicians tend to point with their thumb and fist, while amorous or sexually prolific subjects (think Prince, or maybe a bad Bill Clinton) tend touch other people frequently.

, If you're doing a Donald Trump impersonation, you better be able to smirk sheepishly into a camera. Bert Reynolds impersonators might keep their jaw moving, a-la Norm McDonald's Saturday Night Live impression of the actor. Oprah impersonators are experts at the wide-eyed smile and enthusiasm that comes with one of her coveted recommendations. Someone's eyes, in particular, are wonderfully expressive, meaning you can nail an impersonation if you can mimic them appropriately.The best places to study are extreme emotions, where people tend to have more unique expressions. What is your subject like when overjoyed, angry, excited, or surprised?

, Sometimes putting a costume together will be easy -- if you're impersonating a politician, for example, you'd wear a suit or pantsuit. Bill Cosby impersonators pretty much have to wear a big, colorful sweater. Some costumes will be a little less simple, but remember that you just need to get general idea across. Instead of going out to buy a new outfit, use smaller cues and ideas to get the point across:


Even one piece of clothing, like a hat, shirt, piece of jewelry or tie, can be used to get the point across if well played.
Imagine you ran into them at a coffee shop -- what are they wearing?
Thrift and second-hand stores are the best places to get outlandish and unique clothes cheaply.

, This can be obvious, like a jeweled glove for Michael Jackson. You can also go a little more humorous or outlandish, such as an empty jar labeled ""Iraq's WMDs"" for a President Bush impersonation. A famous soccer player might carry a ball, a chef a spatula, Bugs Bunny a carrot -- simply think about the one object that will pull the impersonation together for your audience.

"
"
Practice in front of a mirror to get the overall impression perfect.,
Record yourself practicing to hear the voice how your audience hears it.,
Push your mannerisms and accent a bit further than reality.,
Add in your own movements, tics, and ideas as they fit the impression.,
React to others ""in-character"" instead of relying on stock phrases and sentences.,
Understand that not everyone can do every impersonation.",How to Do Impersonations of People3," The best way to ensure you're impersonation is on-point is to watch it happen. Jim Carry famously spent hours in front of the mirror working on his celebrity impressions, and the work clearly paid off. Even if you aren't doing as much physical comedy as Mr. Carry, working in a mirror lets you make minute adjustments on the fly, seeing little things that you can't notice otherwise. The longer you practice in front of a mirror the better you'll get.


Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and then jump right into the impression as soon as you open your eyes. Practicing this ""on the dime"" switch will be key for a live audience., Take a few phrases and work on them first instead of trying to pull the accent out of thin air. Just try to perfectly replicate a few phrases exactly how your subject says them. Once you get these down you can start working on a more general accent, as your mouth and mind will be more comfortable with the impersonation.


Can you find other people or actors doing the same impression? This is often a good way to practice, as they will naturally exaggerate important areas to help you hone in on the impression.
Make a note of syllables that give you trouble, and try to find an example of your subject saying them.
Keep practicing the voice to get better and better. How long can you stay in the accent without breaking?

, A good impression doesn't have to be on-the-nose, especially if the impression is subtle or not particularly unique. A good example of this is Kate McKinnon's recent Hillary Clinton impersonation. Mrs. Clinton does not have a particularly unique voice, accent, or set of mannerisms, but McKinnon pushes harder on her costume, facial tics, and flat tone of voice to make something that is not quite the ""real"" Hillary, but is still an instantly recognizable impression.


Be careful about going too far, of course! You want to be recognizable, not a cartoon version of the person.

, Tina Fey's famous Sarah Palin impersonation is credited with the line ""I can see Russia from my house,"" but it's not something Palin ever actually said.SNL's Bobby Moynihan made ""Full Throttle"" the Guy Fieri slogan he's never actually said. A recent Melania Trump impression on The Late Show introduced a steely, 5-10 second gaze at the audience that, while influenced by Mrs. Trump, is still a new spin on the ""character."" If you want to really push your impressions for the audience, you'll paradoxically have to make some things up on the fly.


Remember that if you're performing this for an audience, the impression itself isn't a joke. You'll need to actually do something with it to make people laugh or clap.
A classic, easy joke premise is to put your impersonation in a situation it would never actually be in, like a Barack Obama impersonation where he he has to order his own meal at McDonald's.

, A good impersonation is fluid, meaning you can react and respond to the conversation without dropping the impersonation. While common phrases and words can help people recognize the character quickly, you'll need to be comfortable on the fly to truly impersonate someone. This takes practice, as well as a commitment to the part. The more you can work on the impersonation, especially with a mirror and/or tape recorder, the better you will get.

, Your voice can only change so much. If you have a deep, bass-filled voice, then you will struggle with a high-pitched impression, and there is little you can do to get around this. You'll feel pretty quickly whether or not your voice can hit the right notes, but don't be discouraged if you can't. There are plenty of impressions in your own range.


Just because an accent or impersonation is hard doesn't mean it is impossible -- this skill takes practice. However, you should feel pretty quickly if the tone or pitch is impossible for you to mimic.

Pick someone whose movies or songs you have watched or listened to many times. To learn more about someone, watch them in a variety of roles, listen to a variety of their music, watch interviews they’ve done, and read as much about them as you can.;
, It's much easier to do an accurate impression of someone with an instantly-recognizable way of speaking. While the physical side of an impression is also important, a good vocal imitation will make or break your impression. Popular celebrities for impressions include:


Blake Shelton
John Wayne
Julia Child
Al Pacino
Bill Clinton
Sarah Palin
Morgan Freeman
George W. Bush
Fran Drescher
Sean Connery
Elvis Presley
Prince

, To do a convincing impression, it helps to pick someone you already resemble physically. Frank Calliendo does a great John Madden impression because he shares the same rotund and jolly appearance as Madden.Alternatively, it can be humorous to perfect an impression of a celebrity that is drastically different than you physically. A tiny girl doing a convincing Chris Farley impression could be hilarious.

, The goal of the impressionist isn't to create a perfect mirror of the celebrity, but to capture the ""feeling"" of that celebrity.Watch movies, shows, and especially interviews with your chosen celebrity and take note of their emotions, speech patterns, facial expressions, gestures, and way of looking at the world.


Sarah Palin is known for presenting a ""folksy"" image of herself. Let that folksiness creep into your performance.

, As you watch and listen to the person you're impersonating, keep a running list of quotes, mannerisms, gestures, and facial expressions that they make. Use lots of adjectives in your list. Here, you're already creating the impression, describing them in words and translating their presence into your own voice. Use this list to start slowly working through your impression.For example, note that Brad Pitt is always eating and drinking in his movies, Nene Leakes is constantly patting her weave, and Elvis Presley curls his upper lip.

, George W. Bush's squint and mispronunciations are essential to an impression of him, just as a Shatner impression must involve strange pauses. A good impression is made up of both physical and vocal components that combine to give us the impression of that celebrity. Start by perfecting those unique traits and developing your impression from there., Often, a celebrity will have a particular catch phrase or quote from a movie from which to start with. A good Al Pacino accent would be incomplete without the phrase ""say hello to my little friend"" from Scarface. Even if you can't do a physical version of Pacino, yet, working out that single sentence is a good start.

, Voices can be nasal, meaning that they are high pitched and whiny, or they can come from the gut, meaning that they're deeper and more mellow. Watching the way the person talks can help you locate their voice. Practice speaking from different ""places"" (such as head voice, which is higher, or chest voice, which is lower) to get a feel for your own voice's range.


The Rock’s voice comes from the throat and has a bit of a growl.
Fran Drescher’s voice is high and nasally.

, Some people speak very quickly, while others seem to draw out their words a bit more. Pay attention to whether your chosen celebrity’s speech seems rushed, relaxed, or somewhere in between.


For instance, Robert Downey Jr. often speaks super fast.

, If you want to do a Christopher Walken impression, it helps to be able to do a solid New York accent before attempting it. If you want to do a Julia Child accent, practice your British inflections.


When you become familiar with the general accents, work on specifying them. Within the world of British-English accents, South African, Australian, Welsh, and Scottish accents are all wildly different and unique. Studying accents will help you narrow in on the specific speech patterns of the celebrity you hope to impersonate.

, It can be overwhelming to try to capture all of the quirks that make up a particular celebrity all at once. But since it's a combination of physical and vocal tics, you'll want to try to do them in union.


Start with, say, Pacino's shout and the exasperated glare that he does.
Alternatively, adopt the lopsided smile that Drew Barrymore has and work on recreating the way she speaks out of the side of her mouth.

, Your voice in your head sounds different than your voice to other people. To give yourself a good idea of how you sound while doing your impression, record it on your phone and play it back to see how you're progressing., Jim Carrey famously practiced many hours each day in front of the mirror. Use a mirror to see what you look like when doing an impression, and adjust your facial expressions based on whether you are over- or under-doing it.If you’re trying to do an impression of Victoria Beckham, you’ll want to make sure you’re not allowing much emotion in your facial expressions. Practice speaking in her posh British accent in front of the mirror and concentrate on looking bored and annoyed.

, Coming up with something to say in a given voice can be difficult. To give yourself a wealth of sentences, just read in the voice that you're working on. Vary the tempo and the emotion behind it while you read to practice the different ranges of the voice that you're trying to work out.This will also help you figure out what kinds of words or phrases work well in that voice and what don't. In this way, you can start crafting a better impression.

, While driving, turn on the radio and repeat back what's being said or sung in the voice that you're working out. This is particularly good for impressions of singers. Doing a Britney Spears song in a Jim Morrison voice will also be humorous to reveal to your friends., Like playing an instrument, a good impression needs to be maintained. Don't let your Shatner get rusty. Even after you think you've got a good impression worked out, go back to it every now and then to keep the impression fresh. Consider adding dimensions to the impression. Will Ferrell's President Bush impression grew in complexity over the many years that he performed it."

Go to the parade and show off your awesome, new float!

",How to Build a Float," Many times, the parade committee will have resources to help you build your float. They should also have entry information (time to be at the formation area, insurance waivers, vehicle or decorating requirements) and the rules and regulations to ensure a safe parade.;
, This will depend on the type of parade or venue you will be displaying it in. Obviously, a sports theme or Christmas float will not fit in well at a Mardi Gras parade.


Be realistic in the scope of your project. If you have a certain message you hope your float conveys, whether it is Christmas greetings or a patriotic theme, think small for your first venture into this type of project.

, The complexity of the project may require painters, model builders, carpenters, and the like. Having someone talented or skilled in these areas will make the job much easier.

, Crepe paper, craft paper, flame retardant Floral Sheeting, poultry netting, paint, lumber, and all the other materials you may find you need are not cheap. Some local businesses like craft shops and hardware stores may be willing to donate, especially if their name can be incorporated as advertising in some non-obtrusive manner.

, Usually this is a flat bed trailer of some sort, and it needs to be available for a fairly long period of time, and be in good condition. No parade master appreciates a broken down float in their show. Make sure your platform's axle is rated for the amount of weight you putting on it-

, You will need room to fabricate the details of your float, as well as to set up your trailer for the actual installation of them.

, If you are in a club, school class, or other organization, schedule work times and try to get commitments from the volunteers who sign on to help. This is where good leadership will come in handy.

, Many floats are skirted with either plywood with fringe stapled on the bottom edge; extra long fringe or table skirting; or poultry netting, a.k.a Chicken Wire with 1"" holes wrapped around the base of the trailer hanging down close to the ground. Tissue paper ""pomps"" can be ""gathered"" to tuck into the holes in the poultry netting to make colorful designs, spell out messages, or form other artwork.

, If you are building a multilevel float, you will want to build frames to support each ""stage"", or deck. This can be done using 2x4 lumber framing with a plywood decking, and should use material strong enough to support anything which will set upon this deck or be built above it. You could also stack pallets and secure them together and to the deck. Usually each tier, or stage, will have its own skirt or wall of sorts around it.

, Sometimes, a small portable generator can be either concealed in the framework of your float, or carried in the back of the truck towing the float with an extension cord running to the electrical devices that you need power for. You may want to ask the parade organizers if they have a qualified electrician to ask questions of, or take a look at your work. All cord and cables should be secured to prevent pinching, dragging and disconnection. The generator should be well-ventilated, far away from the passenger compartment, as quiet as possible, and operated where there is no risk of fire or fumes accumulating from it.

, Ideally, you can find an out of the way place to make a practice pull of your new float. This will give you a chance to see if all of the decorations are securely attached and find out how it handles. Depending on how large and elaborate your float is, you may find you need a more powerful vehicle to tow it.

Some people clap more by clapping the fingers of one hand against the palm of the other. Do whatever feels most comfortable for you.;
, You know when the Queen comes out of the castle and deigns to applaud her loyal subjects with a brief applause? That's what you're going for. A demure clap can be done just by clapping with the first two fingers, tapping them into your palm. It should make very little noise, giving the impression that you're clapping more than actually contributing to the group.

, Not all cultures or situations call for hand on hand clapping. Learn to use other types of claps so you'll be prepared to celebrate in all situations.


Stomping your feet is a common way of applauding at some camps and in some sporting events. It makes more of a thunderous rumble that can be quite intimidating and fun.
Rapping your knuckles on the table after a lecture used to be common in some boarding schools, as opposed to clapping.
To snap or not to snap? The cliché that beret-wearing hipsters snap at each others poems at jazzy cafes is a cliché based on an out-of-date 1940s stereotype. If you snap your fingers at a poetry reading, you'll probably be the only one. It's like yelling ""Freebird"" at a rock concert., In situations in which it’s inappropriate to made noise, or when the audience is primarily hearing-impaired or deaf, the general way of clapping is to raise your hands with your palms facing away from you, and to wiggle your fingers.


Sometimes called ""sparkling,"" this is also used to agree or to support a speaker during meetings of consensus, Quaker meetings, or other events during which speaking out is not allowed.

, A slow clap starts and builds gradually into a roar of applause. To start a slow clap, begin clapping no more than once every two seconds and gradually wait for others to build and join in with you. Gradually, speed up.


Slow clapping can often mean a variety of things. Traditionally, a slow clap was considered a kind of heckle instead of a celebration, though now it's considered a kind of winking or ironic celebration of something dramatic ""epic."" You might slow clap your little brother after he finally cleans his bedroom, for instance.

, Clapping can be a great way of showing your appreciation, but it can also be rude if you clap at the wrong time. In certain situations, it’ll be obvious when to clap, but other times are more ambiguous. Not sure when to clap? The best way to avoid an awkward situation is to wait to clap until you hear applause, then join in.


Use the volume of people clapping around you to keep your volume at an appropriate level. Match your style of clapping to the rest of the crowd.
Is it appropriate to clap after a soloist at church? After a good movie? After a solo during a concert? It’ll change in every situation. Go with what happens around you.

, The most common purpose and moment for applause is when something great has just happened in public that deserves celebrating. Speeches, athletic events, and concerts are all common places to clap.


Points in athletic competition, or great plays are often rewarded with clapping and applause in many cultures. In others, overly-dramatic displays of emotion are somewhat looked down on, but if people are clapping it's probably a safe bet that you won't be glared at.
Most people clap after songs at a pop music concert of any kind, as well as when performers come to and leave the stage.
At public speaking events, it's common to welcome a speaker to the stage, and congratulate them at the end of a speech or performance. Depending on the occasion, it's usually uncommon to clap in the middle of most performances, unless directed by the performer. Sometimes accompanying clapping might be requested, or to ""Give a hand"" to someone present. Follow instructions.

, As soon as the clapping starts to die down, it’s ok to stop clapping. Clapping isn’t a chance to interrupt a performance, it’s a chance to celebrate it. Get quiet with the crowd and don't act silly.

, It’s also common to clap as a part of audience participation at some music events or concerts. If the performance was particularly great, continue clapping and try to prompt the performer to come back out for one more song or routine. At the very least, you might get another bow.


As long as you’re tactful, clapping with the beat is a common occurrence at many concerts.

, If, for some reason, you're on stage being celebrated, clapping along with everyone else can be a nice, humble-looking maneuver, done properly. Bow your head to acknowledge the thanks, then start clapping with everyone else. If it goes on too long, give the cut sign and start your thank-yous.


Always thank an audience for any applause that you receive. It's also common to prompt applause for other people present. If, for example, you're giving a big speech and your thesis advisor is present, you might wan to recognize her for applause.

, The rules about clapping during classical performances will depend on the venue, the group of musicians playing, the director, and the piece. It's usually only common to applaud in between individual pieces, and in some cases in between particular movements of a longer piece. In some cases, it's only appropriate to clap to welcome the performer to the stage and to clap at the end of the performance.


Refer to the program for specific instructions regarding clapping, or wait to clap until you hear other people clapping to be sure.
It used to be common in the age of Mozart for crowds to be more disruptive. Particularly moving passages would cause audiences to break into applause while the musicians were still playing.
Many people attribute the newer attitude regarding applause to Wagner, who's direction to avoid curtain calls for Parsifal is thought to have confused some concert-goers into thinking that absolute silence was essential., Traditionally, choral music is not applauded, and is to be appreciated in rapt and contemplative silence. At more modern praise churches, on the other hand, it's very common to applaud the performance after its given. At Pentecostal churches, clapping is pretty much part of the sermon. Every church will be different, so be observant and go with the flow. Don't be the first to clap at church, but join in if you hear the joyful sound.

What do actors want?,
Find out and understand your actors' abilities:


Emotional intelligence: they are flexible in their approach and can deliver a range of emotions.,
Cast wisely.,
Consider the following when auditioning:


Don't look for the perfect actor who fits with the vague ideal in your head, as this will cause a lot of anxiety and could put you off the project.,
Keep in mind that the art of directing requires a substantial amount of confidence, which means you have to be very clear before you get to the set what you want from your actors.,
Make the script legitimately interesting and respectable to everyone, not only those clawing at the opportunity to finally be in a movie.

,
Make sure that your actors take their work very seriously.,
Meet with your actors before the shoot.,
Make sure that your ideas for the scenes are made very clear during rehearsal.,
Reinforce the importance of knowing the lines of the script.,
Encourage them to research their characters deeply.,
Improv.",How to Direct Actors," First and foremost the actor/actress needs to have confidence that you understanding the script, and therefore your direction won't be vague or confusing. They want to know that the director will push them to give a good performance as this will help them grow and learn. Actors need to be treated kind and respectfully as human beings.;
, They have a sense of proportion around the project and are sensitive, honest, have a sense of humor and are good at listening to others. #*Skills- He can play against the obvious reading of the line. Create clear images .
Are they able to give flexibility and expressiveness in voice and movement?
Motivation/commitment: They are committed to the project so they have emotional and physical stamina, trust your decisions.

, Casting is the most crucial decision you will make.

,
The actors ability.
Appearance/quality. Appearance is secondary to whether he/she has what it takes to play the role. Does he/she feel a connection with the characters journey?
Do you work well together? Do they trust your decisions and do you share a mutual respect for one another.
Casting relationships. This means that you build up an ensemble of actors which work well together and you get along with; this way you find the right roles for the actors rather than vice versa.

, Focus on winning and being the best.

,, Understanding the importance of being on time is key. Your time is nothing to mess around with and this needs to be made clear up front.

, There will be a chaotic atmosphere if the actors and directors are not on the same page.

, If you have a different idea of a scene than your actors, then it might come out negatively, to say the least.

, No one wants to see an actor that has to stop every few minutes to say, ""Wait..what's my line?""

, Great actors do that all by themselves but if your actors are not in that category then you will have to tell them to form their roles and characters that they will be playing on a foundation of truth. Rather than doing just an impression of the character.

, This technique should be used during rehearsals.


Paraphrase dialogue. This makes actors think about what they are saying rather than doing a line reading.
Backstory. Use improv for actors to events that happen before the film takes place. This is an alternative to method acting.
Facts. Based upon the bare bones of the scene, use improv to explore
Warm up. improvise what happens before the scene or do a silent improv (just actions) to get actors warmed up for the scene.
Parallels. If an actor is struggling to show the right emotions it may be because they cannot relate to the events for example if it is in space, so improvise a less dramatic event.

Simplify your name.,
Anglicize your name.,
Use your mother's maiden name.,
Use your middle name.,
Use only a single name.",How to Choose a Stage Name1," In many cases, stage names are just simplified versions of a given name. If your full name is particularly long or hard to pronounce, simplifying it might help you out. Some real life examples of this include:


Yves Saint Laurent (born Yves Henri Donat Mathieu-Saint-Laurent)Rudolph Valentino (born Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Pierre Filibert Guglielmi di Valentina D'Antonguolla);
, While controversial, some may choose to modify their name to cater to a Western audience. Similar to simplifying, this often involves editing an ethnic or difficult to pronounce name into something short and easy to remember. Some examples include:


Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara)Kal Penn (born Kalpen Suresh Modi), Use your mother's maiden name as your first or last name. This applies when your mother's maiden name is catchier or easier to pronounce or remember than your given surname. As with most of these methods, the best way to test a name's catchiness is to ask people you know what their reaction to it is. Some examples include:


Katy Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson)chose to use her mother's maiden name when she switched from gospel to pop music.
Catherine Deneuve (born Catherine Fabienne Dorléac)chose to use her mother’s maiden name to differentiate herself from her then-more famous sister Françoise., Take your middle name and make it your first or last name. Times when this might be applicable are when your last name is harder to pronounce, or much to common, like ""Smith."" One famous example of this is Angelina Jolie (born Angelina Jolie Voight)., If your first, middle or last name sounds unique you may choose to go by this alone. Choose the name that has the best middle ground between pronounceable, memorable, and catchy. Some examples of this include:


Beyoncé (born Beyonce Giselle Knowles)Madonna (born Madonna Louise Ciccone)Rihanna (born Robyn Rihanna Fenty)Zendaya (born Zendaya Maree Stormer Coleman)"

Drill
Circular Saw
Pliers
Socket ratchet wrench
Screwdriver
Measuring Tape
Pencil;
, To construct your stage you will need to buy wood that will provide the structure of your stage. Look for lumber that is straight and free from knots. Pressure treated lumber is best if your stage will be resting on concrete or placed outside. For each individual platform you will need:


6 – 8 foot 2x4’s
1 – 8’x4’ sheet of 3/4 inch plywood
12 – 3.5 inch hex bolts
24 washers
12 nuts
26 - 1 ½” wood screws
24 - 3” wood screws

, You will need to cut several different lengths of 2x4s to form the supports of your stage platform. To avoid mistakes and wasted wood, remember this rule of carpentry: measure twice, cut once.From two 8’ pieces of 2x4, cut 3 lengths of wood to 3’9” (45 inches).
You will have 4’3” of wood left from one 2x4, cut it into two 2’ pieces. (Discard the remaining 3”.)
Use a new 8’ 2x4 to cut four 2’ lengths of wood.
From the fourth 2x4 cut six 1’ pieces at a 45º angle on each side. Cut the angles on either end toward each other. The long side of the board will measure 12” while the short side accounting for the angles will be approximately 5 ½”. The angled boards will be used to brace the legs.
The other two 2x4s will be used to make the frame. Don't cut these.

, If you need to build a stage that is bigger than 4’x8’ you will need to create multiple platforms. Cut all of your wood at once to save time in construction.

, Lay the 3’9” pieces of 2x4s parallel to each other with approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) between each piece. Arrange two 8 foot (2.4 m) pieces of 2x4s at the top and bottom of the 3’9” sections to create a frame.


The wood should form a rectangle with one 3’9” section separating the rectangle into two squares.

, Drill a pilot hole to prevent your wood from splitting. Use two screws at each joint to fasten the pieces of wood together.


Attach two 3’9” pieces of wood between the ends of the two 8’ pieces of wood.
The 8’ 2x4 will be on the outside of the 2 shorter pieces.
The shorter pieces of 2x4 will be between the 8’ pieces.
The measurement from the outside edge to the opposite outside edge is 48”.
Place the third 3’9” piece of 2x4 in the middle to support the center of the platform. Center the wood 48” from the end of the 8’ 2x4.

, The 2’ sections of wood that were cut will serve as the legs. Hold or clamp the legs in place to drill a guide hole for a bolt. Drill two holes for each leg all the way through the leg and the frame.Place one leg at each corner of the frame.
Attach the legs to the 8’ piece of 2x4 not the shorter cross beams.
Slide a washer on the 3” bolt and insert it into the holes. Place another washer on the other end of the bolt and fasten it to the wood with a nut.
Tighten the bolts using a socket wrench while holding the nut with the pliers.

, The 2x4s cut with the 45º angle will act as a brace f or the legs. One side of the angle cut 2x4 will be against the leg, and the other side will be flush with the top of the platform.


Drill pilot holes from the angle cut 2x4 into the leg.
Drill pilot holes in the side of the angle cut 2x4 into the beam of the stage frame.
Fasten the brace to the legs and frame using 3” wood screws.

, Turn the platform over on its legs. Place a sheet of plywood on the frame. Attach the plywood to the frame using 1 ½” wood screws.


Use a drill with a screwdriver bit to drive the screws into the wood.
Place a screw around the perimeter of the wood every 16 inches.
Insert two screws in the center of the plywood into the 2x4 cross beam of the frame.

, You can arrange multiple 4X8 sections of stage to create a larger stage for your performance.

, Sand the edges of your wood and the surface of the plywood with a 200 grit sandpaper. Smooth the edges of the wood and surface of the plywood with the sandpaper., Prime the wood with an oil based primer to seal the wood. Paint the surface of the stage and frame with black latex paint. Giving your stage a coat of black paint will help protect the wood., Line up the separate stage sections edge to edge. Arrange four sections to create a stage that measures 8 feet (2.4 m) by 16 feet (4.9 m).

, Give your stage a professional finish by covering the bottom of the stage with black fabric.

Pay attention to what you eat and ensuring that you are getting adequate nutrition.,
Keep your joints and muscles stretched and cared for.,
Make sure you have supervision when performing stretches.,
Remember to include both the positive and negative motions when you stretch.,
Think positive when you're becoming flexible.,
Remember you must always be patient.,
Do stretches every day (for at least 10 to 15 minutes) and work at it progressively.",How to Become Flexible1,"


Maintain a healthy diet. Eat more green leafy vegetables and increase your protein and calcium (drinking milk is one easy way to increase your intake of both of these).
Every morning, eat a good, healthy breakfast.
Drink plenty of water. Since your body is mostly water, you have to be hydrated.
The most important thing is to balance everything. If you don't, you will not be completely flexible.;
, Start your workout with low-impact stretches and work up to a full stretch workout. Later, wind down your routine with low-impact exercising.

, If you have no idea what you are doing you'll undoubtedly injure yourself. Most martial arts schools and gymnastics classes have extensive programs and teachers available. Check them out.

, Keep it symmetrical. If you are stretching your left, stretch out your right too. If you are bending forward, bend backwards too.


If you don't feel a little strain in your muscles, you're not doing it in a way that will prove beneficial. A little strain is normal.

, It takes time but you will get there. Tell yourself motivating things, such as: ""I know I can do this!""

, The key to being flexible is waiting calmly.

, This is important if you want to become flexible! Remember, you can't become flexible overnight. Work at the rate you are comfortable with, and then slowly increase the difficulty (length of time, length of reach or both).


When you are doing stretches, wear comfortable gear, such as tank top and shorts, leotard, and so forth.
Do warm ups before beginning stretches. One way to warm up would to be to do a decent amount of jumping jacks.
Starting with difficult and advanced stretches is dangerous and ill-advised for anyone. Begin from the easier stretches, then move on to the harder ones.


The following sections provide a list of basic, good stretching exercises for your body. Be careful, take them slowly and become comfortable with them before pushing yourself.

Be very clear about the ultimate goals you have for your collaborative project.,
Be very clear about the process goals you have for your project.,
Tell your most importance process goals to your collaborators.,
Tell all your ultimate goals to your collaborators.,
List verbal communication among your top process goals.,
Keep both your process goals and your ultimate goals in mind at all times.,
Be prepared to sacrifice some of your lower-priority goals in order to achieve the higher-priority ones.,
Find something to appreciate every time you look at the artists' work.,
Assess how successful you were in achieving your goals when the project is finished.",How to Collaborate With Artists," How will it look? Sound? Smell? How will it make you feel? How will it make other people feel? When does it need to be finished? How will you know it's finished? Write down your ultimate goals in the greatest detail you possibly can, then sort them and list them in order of their importance to you.;
, How will you and the (other) artists interact? Will there be a single leader? Chosen how? Will you skip the leader idea, and make decisions by consensus, or by majority rule, or another way? How do you expect everyone to feel towards one another and you at the end of the project--affectionate? Friendly? Willing to work together again? As with the ultimate goals in the first step, write down these process goals in order of importance.

, Let them figure out how to apply them. For example, you can tell them ""I want us all to respect every idea anyone suggests""--but leave it to them to figure out how to show respect.

, Be prepared to be more specific than you may have been on paper--artists often know when you are missing pieces of a project. If this happens, you have three options: make a snap decision, ask the artist to decide what's best, or tell the artist you'll give her an answer in 24 hours--and then do it.

, Explain that you expect everyone to make his artistic needs known, verbally, so that they can be taken care of. The responsibility for speaking up lies with the person who has a need until he speaks up. Then it becomes YOUR responsibility to address that need.

, Look at the lists daily while the project is ongoing. Most of us favor one set or the other--when working with artists, both are crucial, so don't neglect either set of goals; if you do, you'll be unhappy with the results.

, If your top process goal was ""to finish this project as great friends,"" you'd be silly to lose that over an ultimate goal like ""I wanted this to be a mauve-y color, and it's too lilac.""

, Even if you hate 99% of it, find the 1% you liked and say so. The artists will recognize what it is you like about what they do, and try to give you more of it.

, Ask the artist(s) for their assessment too.

Choose a provocative word to include in your stage name.,
Stylize your name with numbers, hyphens, or special characters.,
Think about who and what your influences are.",How to Choose a Stage Name2," Create a name that is related to the genre or culture you wish to be identified with. For certain genres, such as heavy metal or punk rock, you may wish to cultivate an intimidating or wild persona. Adding a word like “Zombie” or “Rotten” to your name may help with this. Some examples include:


Sid Vicious (born John Simon Ritchie)Slash (born Saul Hudson), A popular tradition within hip-hop, stylizing your name in this fashion can imply an urban, streetwise persona. Participating in this trend can be beneficial if you are working in a genre associated with hip-hop and pop music. Some examples include:


2pac (born Tupac Amaru Shakur)E-40 (born Earl Stevens)Ke$ha (born Kesha Rose Sebert), Many people choose stage names that reference the people and things that have inspired them. What better way to pay homage as well as lay claim to a particular tradition? Some examples include:


Cassie Ramone of Vivian Girls was inspired to adopt her surname by The Ramones.
Lady Gaga’s name was inspired by the song “Radio Ga Ga” by Queen."

People are more likely to be drawn to a name that relates to the genre they are interested in. Cliche or not, there's a reason so many surf rock bands use the word ""beach.""

, If you want people to be able to find you online, having a stage name like ""Pencil"" is going to hinder you. Your stage name should be something that can be put into google just as it is, and comes up with your online presence. And if people can't hear what you're saying when you tell them your name, or they can't spell it after hearing it, that's one more roadblock to being remembered.

, If you've picked a good stage name that's memorable and stands out, people are going to ask you about it. You want to have more to say other than it sounded good. The best way to do this is to think about choosing a stage name that actually means something to you, at least in some small way.Bono got his stage name from a childhood nickname, ""bono vox,"" which is Latin for ""good voice.""Slash claims he was called his stage name as a kid because he was always running all around., Try to get as much feedback as you can from friends and people you know about your new stage name. Maybe your name makes a reference that is too obscure, or it isn't as easy to hear when spoken in a crowded bar as you thought. Getting second and third opinions is essential, because your stage name is all about how you want people to see you.

Know your audience.,
Get an agent.,
Don’t shy away from assistant jobs.,
Get your script into the right hands.",How to Become a Soap Opera Writer," In order to be a professional writer, you have to have a good understanding of the language, but you also need to be able to write creatively. This means understanding plot lines, being able to bring characters to life, and being expressive with words. Moreover, writing for television is very different from other types of narrative writing, because you have to consider time constraints, commercial breaks, and other factors as well.For writing classes, you can either go to school to earn a degree in creative writing or English, but look for a program that specializes in entertainment industry writing.
If you don’t have the time or money for an entire degree, look for online classes or courses at a local college that you can take to help hone your art. Look for a creative writing course or a class that’s specific to television writing if possible.;
, There may be no better way to learn how to write for television—and soap operas specifically—than to be taught or mentored by someone who has already done it. Some television stations offer mentoring or writing programs for aspiring writers, and will pair writers with staff writers, showrunners, and network executives., Specs, which is short for speculative screenplays, are scripts that aspiring writers write in the hopes of landing jobs. To write a spec, choose a television show that you like and write an episode for it. When writing a spec, there are several things to remember, including:


Be true to the format: make sure the length of your script matches the half-hour or hour-long nature of the show, work in commercial breaks, and write a proper television script.Specs have to be original and innovative, but they also have to adhere to the nature of the show. Essentially, you want to write the episode as though you were actually a staff writer for that show. To do this, you'll need a good understanding of the show’s plot, characters, and tone.
The purpose of a spec is to show employers that you can write, that you can tell a story, and that you understand the basic structure of a narrative (including putting scenes and acts together).Once you’ve finished a spec, don’t be afraid to edit and tighten it up. Once you're happy with it, start another. Specs are like resumes in the TV writing industry, and a good spec can land you a job. You'll get better with each one you write, so don’t be discourage if nobody’s biting after your first or second spec.

, While specs are important in the entertainment industry, they don’t interest everyone, and most people will want to see that you're a versatile writer who can work in other formats as well. And it’s not always specs that get writers hired: sometimes it can be a screenplay, short story, or other piece of writing that catches someone’s attention.


The more you write the more you'll improve, and making it as a writer takes a lot of talent, finesse, and practice.In the entertainment industry, people are always trying to discover the next new thing, so aspire to write something innovative, creative, and interesting that will grab the attention of the people who read it. Try for things that are quirky, wacky, unconventional, and original.

, Soap are known for their over-the-top story lines that are still based in reality. Also, soap operas aren't designed to ever give viewers closure, and since the story line is always open-ended, most episodes end on a cliff hanger that’s designed to bring viewers back the next day. Some tropes that are common in soap operas include:Characters often get pregnant when they aren't expecting to, especially if there's a one-night stand or an extramarital affair.
Most of the characters are related somehow, even if they don’t know it.
Characters, especially younger ones, often age much faster than everyone else.
Characters who are killed off can still return, especially if the body wasn’t found.

, It doesn’t happen all the time, and it’s not a sure way to get discovered, but sometimes networks host writing contests for aspiring writers, While the prizes are often money, sometimes these contests can lead to opportunities with shows or networks, especially if your writing catches the eye of the right person.

, In entertainment writing, the first opportunity to make money in the business often comes from freelancing. These days, most of the scripts that are created for TV are written by staff writers and producers, but each series will also hire freelance writers throughout every season.

, Every TV show, including soap operas, has a bible that lays out the theme of the show, and writers and producers will use this bible as a guide when creating material. If you're trying to get work as a freelancer or staff writer for a particular show, you should study the bible so you know what kind of content they’ll be looking for.When you know the bible for the show you're working on or trying to get a job with, you'll be able to pitch better ideas and write content that’s in line with the show’s themes and style.
If you land an interview to write for a particular show, make sure you know the bible inside and out before going to the interview. This way, you'll be able to pitch better and more impressive ideas.

, Anybody in the entertainment industry, including actors, musicians, and writers, can benefit from having an agent, because it’s the job of an agent to get jobs for clients. Moreover, many producers, executives, and showrunners are too busy to look at scripts that are sent in unsolicited, so an agent may be your only way to get a foot in the door.When looking for agents, ask for referrals from people you know and trust. Agents are busy people too, but if you have a connection, you'll have a better chance of finding someone who will take you on.If you're having trouble finding representation, check the agency list provided by the Writers Guild of America. From there, research a newer agent who specializes in the same kind of writing that you do, and send a query letter directly to that person.

, Sometimes, getting into the entertainment industry as a writer means starting out somewhere else, and many people who are in the industry today began as assistants.


Being an assistant will give you some great insight into the industry, and if you can land a job as a writer’s assistant, that’s even better. Not only can that person act as a mentor, but it will also help you build relationships and connections that could lead to a job down the road.Assistant jobs can also lead to a promotion to staff writer, so if this is the route you want to go, try to get a job on a show you would like to write for. Showrunners or producers will be much more likely to hire somebody they know, and this is particularly true when you know the show and the characters inside and out., Agent or no agent, the key to getting a job as a writer for a soap opera is to get samples of your writing into the right hands. This will be a lot easier if you have a job as an assistant or have an agent, but you can do it yourself with enough perseverance and some luck.


Send your specs to as many people as you can: other writers, producers, showrunners, creators, or anyone else who might have the power to hire you. If you write a new spec or make some really great edits to an older one, send it out again.
If anybody offers you constructive criticism, take it to heart. Listening to the opinions of people in the industry may just get you the advice you need to land a job.
When you do send out your specs, make sure you follow up.This can be as simple as sending an email that says you sent your script and are looking forward to hearing back.

, Give them high-fives and such. When a fan holds out their hand, give them a hard high-five, it will be a memory. When a stag-diver climbs on stage give them a hand and push them off.

, And never throw anything that you will need during the concert like a drumstick or the lead singer's water bottle.

, A thank-you is always good.

Find a qualified body painter.,
Discuss the design you want with the painter.,
Prepare your skin.,
Shave or wax your body hair.,
Eat and drink plenty of water beforehand.,
Set up the space.,
Test the materials you’ll be painted in.,
Remove your clothes.,
Follow your painter’s instructions.",How to Be Body Painted1," If you are getting your whole body painted, you will want to find a professional who knows the ins and outs of the craft. Search the Internet for body painters in your area, and be sure to look at the portfolios of their work.


Call painters you are interested in and ask for a price quote before committing.
Consider meeting with the body painter beforehand. Since you have to be naked or in your underwear to be fully painted, you may find that you’d like to get comfortable with the painter beforehand. Consider hiring a painter of the same sex if you feel that would help you to feel more at ease.
You can also ask the painter if it’s okay to bring a friend with you if it makes you feel more comfortable.;
, Consider what kind of design you want for your body paint. Talk with the body painter beforehand and discuss your ideas. You want to be sure that you are both on the same page so that your design won’t be an unexpected surprise!


You can set up a time to meet with the body painter before the appointment, or you can just talk with them before you get painted.
Consider making a rough sketch of the overall design you want, along with the colors you’d like for your design.
Some people choose abstract designs for their body paint, while others draw inspiration from famous paintings, or get painted to look like specific characters from movies or comic books.

, Take a shower the morning of your appointment to clean your skin. Don’t use lotions, oils, moisturizers or tanning products the day of your painting; these products create a barrier on your skin which makes it more difficult for the paint to adhere and cover your skin. Also avoid using deodorant the day of the painting., Some varieties of body paint affix to body hair, making the application uneven and the removal of the paint more difficult. Ask your body painter if they would advise shaving or waxing your body hair before going in.If you already generally shave or wax your body hair, shave as usual. However, if you would rather avoid having to shave, ask your body painter what they would recommend before going in.
Airbrushing and latex paint in particular are difficult to apply with body hair.

, A full-body painting can take hours. Before you go in, make sure to have a full meal and to drink plenty of water. If you snack during the full-body painting, you may interrupt the painting process, and you could ingest some of the paint that hasn’t dried on or near the mouth.Also try to take a bathroom break directly before the full-body painting so you don't have to take a break in the middle of painting.

, You want to be as comfortable as possible in the hours it will take to apply your body paint. First, make sure that the room feels private enough for you to be in the nude. Ask the body painter to change the temperature if it feels too hot or cold. Also consider playing music or listening to a book on tape to occupy your mind during the painting., Do a spot test of the materials that your body painter will be using. This is especially important to do if they are using latex paint, which can cause allergic reactions.Place a small patch of paint on an area of skin like your arm and wait 15-20 minutes. If the skin under and around the paint is inflamed, test another variety of paint until you find one that works for you.

, Remove your clothes before beginning the painting process. If you feel more comfortable, you can wear nude underwear that can be painted over. Otherwise, take off all of your clothing.If you have long hair, tie your hair in a bun with a hair tie so that it doesn’t get in the way.

, Listen and communicate with your painter throughout the process. You will likely be standing upright and still for most of the painting, but they may ask you to extend your arms or to rotate as they are painting. Check in a mirror every so often so you can be sure that you are getting exactly what you want!


Don’t hesitate to ask for a short break if you start to get tired or if your arms or legs start to fall asleep.

Stand with your feet shoulder length apart.,
Roll your waist in a circle.,
Lower your body down and back up.",How to Whine Your Waist1," To start whining, stand on a flat surface. Hold your feet about shoulder-length apart. Keep your feet flat on the ground to maintain your balance., To start getting the feel of whining, simply roll your waist in a circle. Do not try to incorporate too much movement. Just get used to the feel of moving your waist while keeping the rest of your body still.Strive to make a small circle. You can move in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction.
Go as slowly as you need to go to pick up on the movement. It can take awhile to get used to moving your waist while keeping your shoulders and torso in place.
Keep circling your hips slowly until you feel confident in the motion.

, Once you have a feel for the basic motion, you can lower your body down slightly. Bend your knees just a bit so your waist sinks down to the floor. Go as low as you feel comfortable. Then, move your body back up by un-bending your knees. Keep circling your waist the entire time."

Get the best vocal teacher you can find.,
Learn to act.,
Study the languages of opera.,
Make a commitment.,
Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse!",How to Become a Great Opera Singer and Actor," Become intimately familiar with classical music and opera, but also other styles of music. Excellent musicianship as an instrumentalist as well as singing is important. During a performance you must understand the words, the story, the movement, the emotion, direction and a host of things. Learn to play as many instruments as you can, but master at least one or two. Focus on becoming a great musician in all ways.

Start doing this in your early years and then major in vocal performance in college. Join your school's drama club for some acting and performance experience. Look for community theater and symphony groups and join in.



 

;
, You must train to develop a perfect vocal technique, capable of responding to any artistic demands. Participate in master classes whenever the opportunity presents.

, Opera is not just about singing, acting is just as important. Remember, this is theater so you need to sing and act at the same time

, To give a good performance you need to know exactly what you are performing. Learn to speak, understand, read and correctly pronounce the main languages of opera: Italian, French, German, Russian, Dutch, and English. Part of performing opera is translating the opera so you may understand it, and then learning to sing and act it in the language in which it was written

, You must have a passionate love of your art, you will need complete dedication, a strong will, a charismatic personality, the drive to rehearse and perform no matter what, even if you're in terrible pain or really sick. Let nothing stop you or slow you down. There must be nothing in your life of greater importance than your art, and you must be happy to make any sacrifice, and there will be sacrifices; many many sacrifices.

, Being a successful opera performer is more than a desire, it's a life-style. You must commit to study hard, rehearse many, many hours each day, and plan other life commitments around your rehearsal time. Rehearsal should be your full time job, and you should love every minute of it. This is not optional.

Choose your design.,
Pick a place for the design.,
Spot test if you have sensitive skin.,
Sit still as the paint is being applied.,
Check the design in a mirror.",How to Be Body Painted2," If you are getting a body painting at a fair or carnival, decide on a design. Many face and body painting booths have pictures of designs hanging up that you can choose from. See if you like any of these designs, or ask if they can do other designs.


When it’s your turn to get painted, tell the body painter about what design you want. If the design is not one of the ones displayed, describe what you want.
You can say something like, “I want a blue octopus,” or “I want a tree with an orange sun behind it.”
Make sure to specify what colors you want for your design. Consider drawing it if the artist seems unsure of what you want.

, Choose a good place for your body painting. Pick a spot that is large enough to fit your design and that is exposed rather than under clothing. Also try to pick a spot that is relatively hairless, as it’s harder to paint intricate details over hair.


Good spots for small body paintings include your upper arms, calves, or the top of your chest if you are wearing a tank top.
Once you pick the spot, the painter will likely wash the area with water and mild soap to clean the skin.
If the spot you pick is on your face, neck or shoulders and you have long hair, tie it back to make sure it doesn't get in the way!

, Even body or face paint used at fairs can cause allergic reactions in some. If you have allergies or sensitive skin, do a spot test on your arm and wait fifteen minutes. If your skin becomes inflamed, do not proceed getting painted and ask if they have any other kinds of paint., Small body paintings can be very detailed, so it’s important to sit still as the artist works. If you fidget, their brush could slip, which could mess up your design., After the artist is finished, look at your design in a mirror. If you want them to add anything or change a section of the design, ask if that is possible. Otherwise, enjoy your new body art!

Remove excess paint.,
Wear soft, loose clothing.,
Consider doing face makeup.,
Remove body paint by the end of the day.",How to Be Body Painted3," If you have undergone a full body painting where the artist used airbrushing, you may find that body paint has caught on to areas of your face like your eyebrows or your eyelashes. Use baby shampoo or makeup remover to remove some of this paint and to brush up your look.To avoid taking off more of the design than you mean to, use a small Q-tip or cotton ball to target the area, rather than a large towel which could end up removing more of the design than you intend!

, If possible, try not to wear clothing that will rub against your body painting. If you have a full body painting and have to go out in public, wear loose-fitting clothing that will be less likely to rub off your paint. If you have a small design, don’t wear clothing that will cover and smudge it., If you have done a full body design, consider putting on face makeup. Because you will probably be taking a lot of pictures, you want to be sure that you facial features also stand out. Apply eye makeup like eyeliner and eye shadow to make your eyes stand out, and wear lipstick that matches or complements your body paint., As much as you may love your design, you shouldn't wear it to sleep. Leaving paint on your body for an extended amount of time can irritate your skin, and the design will start to rub off in your sleep anyway. Remove the body paint in the way your body painter recommends, as it can be slightly different depending on what type of paint was used.


Many professional full-body painters provide a removal kit with instructions that is included in the cost of the painting.
A combination of rubbing alcohol and baby oil are often used to remove body paint used in full-body painting.If you are removing a small body painting, scrub the area gently with soap and water. If not all of the design is removed, use a gentle makeup remover or baby oil to get rid of the residue.
Always moisturize after you remove your body paint. Your skin has been through a lot and you want to make sure that it is moisturized and replenished!

Start leaning a little as you get comfortable.,
Move your waist in a pattern.,
Keep your upper body completely still.",How to Whine Your Waist2," Whining usually adds a variety of motion to the circling move. After you've mastered the basics of moving up and down while whining, move to the side. Shift your torso slightly to the left, lowering your knee as you shift your weight to the left side. Then, return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.This move is a variation on whining. You can add it to a routine, but you can also simply whine with minimal movement.

, As you get comfortable moving your waist in a circle, try to follow a whining pattern. Move your hips forward, to the side, backward, and then to the other side. Do this while counting, ""One... two... three... four"" in your head. This will help you maintain rhythm while you whine., Whining is all in your waist, hips, and legs.

Follow the rhythm of the music.,
Keep your back straight.,
Add some variation.,
Stretch between sessions.",How to Whine Your Waist3," When you get comfortable whining in public, pay attention to the rhythm. As you whine, move your hips to the beat of the music. Whine faster as the tempo increase and slow down as it decreases., A straight back can keep your upper body still when whining. Be aware of your back at all times. Make sure your back is straight at all times. This will help with effective whining., As you get comfortable whining, try adding some variation. You can dance in front of someone while whining, leaning your behind back slightly. Slow whining includes dancing very slowly to exaggerate the movements of your hips.Leaning to one side and then another while whining can also add some variation.

, Regular stretching can help increase your range of motion. Gentle stretches before and after dancing will improve your whining skills as you'll be more flexible.


For one stretch, bend your right knee at a 90 degree angle, keeping your right foot flat on the floor. Bend your left leg back behind you, parallel to your other leg and with your left foot stretching behind you. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch the positions of your legs.Lie on your back with your knees bent at 90 degree angles. Bend your right leg in front of you while lifting your hips until you form a perpendicular angle with your right leg. Move your right leg towards the ceiling. Then, lower your leg slightly. Do 10 repetitions and then switch legs.

Before you do anything, you must make sure you are ready of the ups and downs.,
Try to take singing/acting classes, depending on what you want to do.,
Try to get known around your area.,
Try to find an agent.,
Keep trying.,
Audition for good parts.,
Cooperate with co-stars.",How to Become a Disney Star As Big As Miley Cyrus," Look at any supermarket magazine to know these. There will be rumors spread, and anything you say may set people off. And most stars get caught up in scandals, although most are just photo-shopped, remember what could happen.;
, Taking classes makes you even better! You will want a patient yet professional instructor, instead of an amateur, impatient instructor.

, If you want to be a singer, you can maybe sing at restaurants. If you want to be a famous actor/actress, you can go onto YouTube. You can do that for singing, too. Always start out small so you have experience, and to put on your resume'. You never want to just jump into movie/TV auditions until you're ready.

, From there on out, an agent can get you auditions. But if you can't find an agent, then you can try going to websites to get auditions. But you must somehow get auditions. to be noticed and have a chance at getting the part.

, You will not get every role, and that's a fact. If you give up after being rejected once, you won't be big for long. If rejected, go home and let out all your emotions, and go back out the next day, ready to try again.

, Another thing to do is try out for good parts. You won't get anywhere if you are broadcasted on small channels that aren't watched much with a show with an amateur script writer. Miley Cyrus got so big because many children loved her show. Find a part you know you could do, and remember that even if it doesn't relate to you, if you could do it, then go ahead.

, Cooperation is key. Even if you're stuck with a diva who could act, sing, dance, and play guitar practically since she was born, and a geeky guy who talks and sings like a girl, find something you have in common, and if you have co stars closer to your age, invite them over for a sleep over or out for cappuccinos. If they are older, then just be nice to them.

From the toprock dance steps you can transition into floor rock or a power move., The main job of your arms while toprocking is to echo your feet. They're like a backbeat. They should never stead the focus. As you move, keep your arms as loose as possible. Swing them around like an inflatable tube guy, or let your body move your arms naturally while you work your feet.


To vary the open-cross gesture, cross your arms when you bring them back.If you're doing a small step forward, mark it by swinging just one arm in front of you.

, Lift it about half a foot (15 cm) off the ground, by lifting your knee up and inward while your calf and foot extend away from your body.

, Point your right foot down and outward, just until your toes or ball of your foot touches the ground. This is a fast motion, so you don't have to firmly plant your foot on the ground. As you point your right foot back down, shuffle your left foot outward so that your toes are pointing outward.

, Practice combining the movements of your right foot and your left. Keep moving to the right, in the direction of your pointed foot, as you lift and lower your right foot while you shuffle your left foot inward and outward. Once you master this technique, your right foot should lift exactly when your left foot turns inward, and your right foot should point downward when your left foot turns outward.

, Once you've taken at least five steps to the right, you can switch to the left side. As your right foot hits the ground one last time, switch it to your ""shuffling"" foot, and begin to lift and lower your left foot as your right foot shuffles inward and outward to the left.

, Now just repeat the same motion with alternate legs. Slide and bring your left foot up. Lift it about half a foot (.3 meters) in the air, with your knee lifted up a bit. Your right foot should remain in the same position.

, Drag your right foot back about the distance of its own length while your left foot remains lifted in the air.

, Plant your left foot on the ground while lifting your right foot back to its toes. This will make it easier to lift your right foot in the next step.

, Keep sliding one foot up while moving the other back until you've mastered the incredible ""Running Man"" dance move.

Alternate between the two shuffles.,
Add a spin.,
Add some arm movement.",How to Shuffle (Dance Move)3," To truly do the shuffle, you'll have to combine the ""T-Step"" and ""The Running Man."" To do this, simply move to one side while doing the ""T-Step"" and then switch to the ""Running Man"" instead of moving to the other side. Take five steps to the left and when you lift your left foot or the last time, turn 90 degrees forward or backward, and use this foot as your lead foot for the ""Running Man.""


Do ""The Running Man"" in place, or even move in a circle as you show off your skills. Then, when you plant both of your feet, choose one foot to be the lifted foot for the ""T-Step"" and start doing that type of shuffle. You can use this trick to move back and forth between the two dance moves.

, Start off by doing ""The Running Man"" either more or less in place or in a circle, and then turn your body 90 degrees to the right or left and start moving from left to right as you do the ""T-Step."" Just wait until your feet are both in the planted position during ""The Running Man"" and then lift one of your feet and begin using it as your lifted leg for the ""T-Step"" as you move in the direction of that leg.

, You can really alternate between the ""T-Step"" and ""The Running Man"" in whatever way you want. You can take just one or two steps of the ""T-Step,"" turn your body, and then move right into the ""Running Man."" You can take two or three steps of ""The Running Man"" and switch back into the ""T-Step,"" take just a few steps of that dance, and then return to ""The Running Man"" again.


You can also emphasize one move over the other. You can focus more on the ""T-Step"" and occasionally burst into ""The Running Man"" or vice versa. You don't need to do both dance moves equally.

, If you want to kick your shuffle routine up a notch, just spin while you do either ""The Running Man"" or the ""T-Step."" To spin while doing the ""The Running Man,"" just do the running move while subtly moving in a circle every time you plant your foot. You can practice doing this slowly as you become more comfortable doing the move while spinning.


To spin while doing the ""T-Step,"" just plant the shuffling foot as you shuffle it in the center of a circle while you rotate your body around the circle by rotating your lifting foot.

, Though your leg movements are the most important part of the shuffle, once you've mastered the footwork, you should pay more attention to your arms. If you keep your arms at your sides while you try these dance moves, you'll look like a robot. Instead, keep your arms slightly out and just move them in a way that feels natural with your feet.


If you're doing the ""T-Step,"" just move your arms out whenever you plant your lifted leg, and move them in when you lift your leg.
If you're doing ""The Running Man,"" just move your arms back and forth in a fun way that mimics the arm work of running with a hip-hop flavor.

Identify what subjects or feelings can be expressed by dance.,
Pick music with fluctuating rhythms, moods, and dynamics.,
Ask yourself what you’re feeling when you listen to the chosen song.,
Know how certain motions and shapes are generally perceived.,
Experiment with different motions and gestures.,
Focus on your chest movements.,
Match your arm movement to the musical mood.,
Lift your eyebrows and relax your jaw.,
Make eye contact with the audience.,
Practice your routine for a coach or friend.",How to Show Emotion and Soul in Dance," When deciding what song, play, or book you want to perform, ask yourself if the story you’re considering can be well communicated through the medium of dance. For example, just because your favorite book is Ulysses, doesn’t mean it’s a good choice for your next dance number. It may fill you with all kinds of emotions, but the word play and poetic quality of the novel makes it largely dependent on language.Similarly, fantasy or sci-fi genre narratives often rely on over-the-top visual elements. Even if you love the emotional element and soundtrack of a particular sci-fi movie, your audience might find it difficult to identify with the story and its attendant emotions without the visual components.
Think instead about what stories you love and which aren’t tied so closely to language or visual effects. Folk tales, fables, and fairy tales are often great choices, as the stories are well-known and they communicate clear, strong, and changing emotions.;
, A high-energy pop song can fill you with a surge of positive emotion, but that’s probably the single feeling it communicates. If you’re looking to touch your audience with a more complex emotional experience, it’s better to choose a song containing varied stages and moods.


For example, look for crescendos and decrescendos, as these gradual changes in the volume and quality of the music can be effectively reflected in your movements.A couple good examples of songs with building textures and varying dynamics are Stevie Wonder's Sir Duke and Rose Royce's Car Wash., Before you begin to experiment with movement, take some time to listen to the music and register your feelings. Think about what physical sensations run through your body, what stories or times in your life come to mind, and what feelings emerge as you listen.Once you’ve identified your emotions, try to match them to different points in the song. For example, if the song starts out melancholy and contemplative for about thirty seconds, mark this out on a piece of accompanying sheet music. If it turns to a more energetic, uplifting mood after thirty seconds, make a notation at the thirty-second mark.

, While dance is a highly subjective art form with no fixed rules of expression, studies have shown that certain types of movement tend to elicit specific emotions. For example, curved shapes and circular motions are typically perceived as peaceful and soothing, while straight lines and choppy gestures are understood as emphatic and even aggressive.Similarly, rapid, accelerating, and seemingly impulsive movements tend to signal happiness or buoyant emotion, while slower motions often portray sadness or pensiveness., Once you know what motions and shapes tend to evoke certain emotions, think about how you would add your personal take. If the first minute of the song seems joyous, what hand and arm gestures would you use to convey joy? What position of the head, and legs could do so? Try out your ideas in the mirror to see how well the acted-out gesture matches the intended emotion.The key to making this brainstorming session effective is keeping an open mind and experimenting with a broad range of motions. Even if you don’t end up using any of the specific moves you perform at this point, you can generate valuable ideas and inspiration for your eventual choreography.

, Researchers studying the way audiences watch dance performance have found that spectators tend to look to the dancer’s chest as a way of deciphering emotional content.This means that you should pay special attention to the way you hold and move your chest while dancing.


For example, heaving or sighing motions indicate yearning or struggle, while a puffed-out chest can signify assertiveness and strength.

, Arms are another important body part which observers use to understand a dancer’s emotion. To wit, dancers in one study were instructed to convey joy, sadness, and anger simply by adjusting their arm movements. In each case, audiences correctly identified the dancer’s target emotion.Generally, wide, swift arcs and rising motions indicate anger, arms stretched toward the front indicate joy, and slow motions with little movement in the elbows indicate sadness., While people tend to express emotion in daily life through varied facial expressions—for example, scowling when angry or frowning when sad—you should adjust your face differently when dancing. Rather than animatedly mirroring the emotions in your dance, you should strive for an open expression—typically characterized by lightly arched eyebrows and a relaxed jaw—like the one you would adopt when listening to a friend’s confidences.This expression allows you to engage the audience without pantomiming.


Some forms of dance such as gymnastics dance or pom squad require the dancer to hold a fixed grin throughout their routine.

, It can be tempting to look at the floor when dancing, either because you’re concentrating on bodily movement or you’re battling with stage fright. In order to show emotion when dancing, though, you’ll need to look out at the audience and, if possible, make eye contact. This is because the eyes are one of—if not the most—expressive facial features, and humans rely on eye contact for meaningful interaction., Often times, what seems sufficiently pronounced or emphatic from a dancer’s perspective doesn’t come across to the observer, so it’s essential to get feedback from another pair of eyes. Run through your routine with a friend, fellow dancer, or coach and ask them to watch specifically for how well you’re emoting.If you’re not effectively expressing emotion, strive to stretch your limbs, lift your chin, and exaggerate your motions."

Start by thinking about how you are bringing this troupe together.,
Keep it small.,
Make sure you all have similar interests and a shared vision.,
Start finding out about possible performance opportunities.,
Think about whether or not you will need to set up a business name/ABN etc.,
Operate with a business mentality.,
Get online.,
Photos.,
Come up with a theme for your group.,
Organisation can be tricky, especially managing schedules of different performers.,
Network.,
Have FUN!",How to Run a Burlesque Troupe," Are you all friends with common interests? Or are you searching for people with a similar vision to perform with? Regardless, make sure that you as performers have equal say in of the creation and progress of your troupe. Troupes that involve every member in the creative process are much stronger in the long run. Not every idea will be used, but approaching each member's opinion with an open, receptive mind will make all the difference.;
, Groups of three to five girls are probably big enough in the beginning. As your organization and skill for production improves, you can consider taking on more performers. Remember, the smaller the group, the easier it is to coordinate rehearsal times, workshops and show dates.

, Your road will be easier if you have this. Remember, it is incredibly important to have similar goals in mind when sourcing performers. Are you looking to tour, or are you rooted in one area? Is forming a troupe a potential business venture, or a simply hobby? It is important to have a uniting theme that ties performers in as members of the troupe, but variety is the spice of life. Showcasing each performer's individual talent is much more important than forcing conformity.

, Are there any 'newbie' nights in your area for upcoming performers? Do you have friends/families that would let you do a private show and build up your set lists? Offering to stage kitten or help out at established shows can also be a foot in the door, though you should not presume to be asked to perform simply after selling a bit of merchandise!

, A good rule of thumb is to operate for 6 months to 1 year and see what your financial situation is like and whether you want to consider this professionally. Talk to a business mentor or a tax representative to be sure.

, Even if you are only really a hobby group, think business wise. Create a brief business plan - think about how you are going to market yourself and make yourself individual. Check out your competitors and analyze, with an objective mind, what their strengths and weaknesses are and how your group will compare.

, Most successful businesses and groups have an online presence. The more places you are online and the more searchable you are the better success you will have at being hired. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all excellent. As far as creating a website, there are several free website builders with easy templates to help you get started. Make sure you create an email address specifically for your group to protect both your privacy and your inbox capacity!

, While on the subject of websites and emails, there is very little point getting online if you don't have photos or images to showcase your group. You only need a small budget and a little bit of imagination to get some great photos. Get a friend that is camera savvy and can take a good snap or offer TFP for emerging amateur photographers. Local photography forums may offer a step in the right direction. If you're inclined, you might only need to scout some good locations or invest some lighting and a backdrop to get a few good photos.

, What sort of image do you want to have? This might evolve and change over the years, but in your initial stages what kind of look do you want? It comes back to your ideas about what burlesque is and what style you want to perform. Classic? Neo? You can get great costumes by perusing a local costume store, vintage or second hand stores, or online. Or if you have an act prepared, try getting some staged shots of it. Most importantly make sure the photos represent your group in a concise, creative way.

, It's likely you will all have your own ideas for acts and costumes so keep that very collaborative. That aside, work out your own strengths and weaknesses. Find someone that has time to deal with everyday emails/Facebook inquiries. You may find local artists willing and able to help create promotional material as well. Keeping each member of the troupe engaged in the building of a recognizable identity is important, so make sure everyone has a voice!

, Build alliances with other performers. It's unlikely you will be able to run a show from start to finish with fewer than five members. Keep in mind, each act is typically 3-5 minutes long. Add comedians, MCs, dancers, actors, musicians to your friend list on Facebook. Keep a track of performers in your local area. Check out their shows and introduce yourself. Always keep a business card handy! You never know what may come of a chance run in.

, There's no need to stress. Keeping a light, positive attitude will ensure that everyone enjoys each step of the process. You may not be a Dita Von Teese, Immodesty Blaize or Kitten De Ville overnight, but keep in mind, neither were they! If you ever begin to feel as though the stress of producing shows and organizing other performers is too great, then solo performance may be the route for you. But overall make sure you behave professionally, explore the history of this incredible art form and have fun!

Poi can be either made or purchased.,
Slip the looped ends of the rope over your hands.,
The ideal place to practice poi is either outside in good weather, or in an open space with a high ceiling indoors.

,
Hold your arms down by your sides and swing both poi to get a bit of momentum going, slowly(about a second a rotation, it doesn't sound slow but its very tempting to try to go faster, at which point its harder to control) rotate your wrists so the ball spins forward.,
WEAVING: the most basic trick.,
Once you feel you have mastered this repeat with the other poi.,
This basic weave is the basis of many other tricks so once you've mastered that you're off to a flying start.

,
Look online or ask a friend to show you some special moves.",How to Start Learning Poi," Poi can be made by using tennis balls and rope. Put the rope through the ball and tie a knot in the end. Tie a loop in the other end of the rope. You should have two of these. Another option is the use of football (soccer) socks. If you buy poi, then it's advised to start with soft poi (bean-bag style) rather than glow poi which tend to be harder, or fire poi which are very dangerous and should only be attempted after a lot of practice.;
, If you have bought poi they will probably have two loops at the end, put your index and middle finger through these.the string should be roughly the same length as your arm.

,, Keep practicing this trying to keep the movement equally timed on both sides(""in beat""). It can often help to practice to music to keep this beat. If possible watch your reflection to make sure the poi are parallel, not crossing in front of you or spinning out.

, Practice with one poi first. start by spinning as you have been doing then cross your arm in front of your chest, if possible try not to move the whole arm but focus the movement in the wrist. Mastering this helps to greatly control your movements and is essential for harder tricks. Try to move the poi in a figure of eight shape (practice without the poi first if you're scared of hitting yourself) so it crosses in front of you, circles on the opposite side, then returns to the start.

, Then try with both. DON'T cross them in front at exactly the same time or they will tangle up and hit you. Instead, move them across a beat after each other(it helps if you see one as following the other).

,, Practice these.

The ""one-and-two"" and ""three-and-four"" steps should take about as much time to complete as the ""five-six.""
Get some good shag dance music going, while you're at it. Here are some favorites:

""The Flame"" by Fine Young Cannibals
""Do You Believe"" by Cher
""Never Make a Move Too Soon"" by B.B. King
""Your Heart's in Good Hands"" by Al Green
""Mojo Boogie"" by Henry Gray

;
, Know that the idea of counting is to give your feet a beat to move to. Your feet will move with every count, which includes any number you say as well as the word ""and.""


Before you try incorporating the shag dance moves, just step in place. Alternate between your left and right foot. Repeat until you're comfortable counting the rhythm and alternating feet. In the shag dance, you'll never step with the same foot twice in a row.
This is a fluid, not a jerky dance move. Think of your forward and backward movement as the movement of a swinging pendulum. Avoid having any bounce in your steps and smoothly transition from one step to the other.

, This is an important thing to know before you begin to shag dance. Think of it as the partners creating a mirror image of each other's steps. If you're at a loss for what to do and have a knowledgeable partner who is facing you, just mirror his or her footsteps.


Women should always do the same step as the men but with the opposite foot. Women, therefore, should lead with the right foot.
As you start to move your feet, remember that your lower body should do most of the work for this particular dance. Keep your upper body upright and tall and avoid swaying.
Both men and women should wear leather-bottomed shoes, with the women wearing flats, to prevent them from shuffling across the floor.

, The man and woman should stand facing each other. Men and women should keep their feet lose and relaxed, standing so that they are facing each other, with their feet opposite each other with about an arm's length of space in between them.The man should hold the woman's right hand with his left hand. He should hold her hand fairly firmly, without gripping her too tightly, to lead the woman. The forearm of the hands that are holding each other should be level with the floor, and should not sway from side to side or move up or down, either.
The pair should keep the non-holding arm in a relaxed, but slightly forward hanging position.

, The step should be no longer than the length of his foot. As he does this, the woman should step forward with her right foot.


This step occurs on the ""one"" beat.

, As he does this, the woman should step forward with her left foot. Think of it as stepping up to a line, having your feet meet in the same place, so that they are evenly positioned on the ground.


This step occurs on the ""and"" beat. From your original starting position, it is as if you simply stepped up one ""space.""

, This foot should now be in its original starting position. As the man steps back his left foot, the woman should step back her right foot to its starting position.


This step occurs on the ""two"" beat.

, Think of it as moving the right foot the length of two feet, so that it is positioned one ""foot"" behind the left foot. The woman should step her left foot back one foot length behind her right foot.


The step occurs on the ""three"" beat.

, He can also take a small step in place, but he should make sure not to move his foot forwards or backwards. The woman should shift her weight onto her right foot, making sure not to move forward or backwards, either.


This steps occurs on the second ""and"" beat.

, The man should do the same thing he did with his left foot, taking care not to move forward or backwards as he shifts the weight. As he does this, the woman should shift her weight on her left foot.


This steps occurs on the ""four"" beat.

, His left foot and right should now be parallel, as if he had stepped up to meet a line, stepping one full ""space"" back from his original starting position. As he does this, the woman should step her right foot back to meet her left foot.


This step occurs on the ""five"" beat.

, The foot will now be one foot's length in front of the left foot. As he does this, the woman should step forward with her left foot.


This steps occurs on the ""six"" beat.

, As he does this, the woman should step her right foot forward, repeating her first step.


This occurs during the new ""one"" beat.

, Keep counting and moving your feet in the same way to the beat. As you get more experienced, you can get a bit more creative with your body movements by moving in a circle as you face your partner, having the man spin the female partner, taking more exaggerated steps, or by putting some more arm movements into the mix.The female partner can also spin on her own to add some flair to the dance.
Though the traditional hand position is for the pair to hold opposite hands with the other hands free, the man can place his hand on the small of the woman's back during the dance, or just during part of the dance, too.
One partner can even dance behind the other, still holding hands while facing that partner's back.

Get a place to dance--such as a basement or your room--where you would have enough privacy and enough space for everyone to move around freely.,
Draw up fliers so people will know that you are forming a group and looking for members.

,
Hold auditions and pick the best people for your style of dance.However, be a little cautious about people who are amazing.,
Once you've got all of your people, have a group consensus on a name.

,
Decide on when you will hold the practices (I recommend at least once a week).

,
Have everyone pitch in money for the costumes so your dance group will look awesome.,
Pick some awesome music that your dance group can dance to and do a good choreography.Make sure the music is family friendly if you plan to perform at all ages events.

",How to Start a Dance Group," You will want privacy because you don't want other dance groups spying on your group!;
,, You can still let them in, but they could be spies for another dance group. Think about this: if they are amazing why would they join a group that's just starting out?

,,, Make sure everyone agrees on the costumes beforehand, though, and that the costumes make it easy to move around (do splits, handstands, whatever is appropriate to your type of dance).

Throw on some polka music.,

Learn the lead's steps.,
Learn the follower's steps.,
Do the steps in time with the music.,
Polka to the side.,
Start turning.,
Do it in promenade pose.,
Add some hops.,
Switch legs.",How to Polka," Jimmy Sturr, Walter Ostanek and his band, and the Brave Combo are three names to try on your ears, but any good Internet radio site will have a polka station that is bound to bring up some catchy beats. Alternatively, most country music has a good beat for polka, too. The accordion is only recommended, not necessary.;
, The man's left hand and lady's right hand should be extended out at an angle so that the hands are at the same height as the lady's shoulders. The man's right hand should then go on the lady's left shoulder blade and the lady's left hand should rest lightly on the man's shoulder. You should feel a solid connection, neither too delicate nor too heavy.


This is the position you will maintain for the entirety of the dance. Make sure to always keep your back straight and your clasped hands strong. The polka is confident and carefree and your stance should reflect that.

, There are few dances that can be as basic as the polka. Bare bones, it's just three steps: right, left, right. Then you repeat it on the other side: left, right, left. That's it! Here's the basics:


Step forward with your left foot
Meet your left foot with your right
Go forward with the left foot again
Step forward with the right foot (passing the left foot)
Meet your right foot with your left
Step forward with your right foot again. Voila!

Think of it as full step, half step, half step. Full step, half step, half step. That first step is longer, followed by two shorter steps.



, The lady's steps are the same as the man's, but starting with the right foot going backwards: back, together, back. Back, together, back. Here's a few more details:


Step back with your right foot
Meet your right foot with your left
Go back with your left foot
Step back with your left foot (passing the right foot)
Meet your left foot with your right
Step back with your left foot again. Boom! Finished.

Again, remember that the first step is the largest, followed by two smaller steps. So it's full step, half, half. Full step, half, half.



, Polka music usually has a marching rhythm of 2 beats per measure. Right, left, right matches 1 and 2. Left, right, left matches 3 and 4. That is, you should be taking three steps for every two beats. If you don't have any polka music, most country standards will suffice.


Polka is about having fun. Imagine those Eastern Europeans in their beer halls having the time of their lives doing it and let loose! Add your own flair however the music takes you.

, With the same three step movements and holding your partner in the same fashion, trying polkaing to the side. Instead of it being like a step ball-change or a little shuffle, it'll probably look more like a skip. It can be very bouncy and upbeat. Try going back and forth, in squares, and front and back again.


Don't change the alignment of your body. Keep your feet facing your partner and just move them right or left. Your back stays straight, your arms stay up, and you let your legs do the work.

, Why? Because it's time to get fancy. You've got the polka down from front to back and from side to side -- and not it's time to start turning. The lead will determine whether the couple turns right or left and both are the same idea:


Start with a basic polka. After a measure or two, the lead should starting turning forward and to his 2 o' clock on his left, right, left, and then turn back (toward his 7 o'clock) on his right, left, right. That's a right turn basic; the left is just turning the opposite way. A full 360-degree turn should be completed in 4 counts. Try doing several in a row!
If you're polkaing to the side, take 2 counts to do a 180-degree turn, flipping around, now facing the other direction. If you're leading, you can whip your partner around and around and around. Just don't get too dizzy!

, That's fancy terminology for opening up your stance. Instead of holding your partner in front of you, you should each take your foot closest to your clasped hands and rotate 90-degrees. Your hands and torso stay in the same position, but your feet are facing forward.


If that was at all confusing, think of the tango. The two parties are facing each other, torsos held high, but their legs are moving to the side, driving them forward. It's similar -- but with fewer roses and dips.

, If you're doing the polka in promenade pose, your legs are open and able to do some hopping! If not, your partner is in front of you -- hopping would just end up in your two bumping knees. So take advantage of that open pose and bring your knees a bit higher on each step -- and highest on the first full step of each cycle -- beats 1 and 3, namely.


You know those high knees your gym teacher made you do? It's really just like that, only voluntary. For beats 1 and 3, just add a little pep to your step. It can be a lot more fun when you get into it!

, Again in promenade pose, you can sometimes switch it up by using different legs. Since they're open, you and your partner can start on outside legs, start on inside legs, or start on opposite legs. It can create an interesting mirroring effect that isn't seen otherwise.


Just for clarity's sake, this is only in promenade pose. Using the same leg when your facing your partner will end up in you two playing a dancing game of bumper cars.

Have fun!",How to Prepare for a Solo in a Dance Recital," If there are any parts you are struggling with, practice them until you are confident that you can get them right. If you cannot get them right, ask your dance instructor for extra practice. You may also ask to modify certain parts of the dance. If you can, practice to the music in order to achieve perfect timing. Be sure to pay attention to the technical parts of the dance too, not just the routine itself. These parts include posture, turnout, lift etc.


Practice daily in the week or two leading up to the recital, and ask your instructor to watch you practice. This will make sure you know the routine by heart and can perform it perfectly.;
, The night before your performance, collect everything you need to take with you and put it in the same place. Use your dance bag or another large bag so that it's easy to transport. This way you won't be frantically running around through your house looking for things and causing yourself more stress right before you're supposed to go onstage. Make a checklist: dance shoes, costume, makeup, tights, water, snacks, change of clothes. Consider putting this in a highly visible spot, in your car, or taping a note to your door so you don't forget it.

, If the performance is in the afternoon or evening, make sure to eat a good breakfast and lunch, and have a snack an hour or two before you go onstage. Don't overeat, as this can make you feel bloated and slow, but make sure that you provide your body with enough fuel to get you comfortably through the performance.

, Make sure you arrive at the theater or studio, wherever the performance will be held, well before your performance so that you can thoroughly warm up and stretch before you go onstage. Dancing is a very physical activity and you could pull a muscle or otherwise hurt yourself if you try to perform before you're ready, so make sure you warm up slowly, stretch each muscle group, and get yourself completely ready before you begin dancing.

, This can include dark eyeliner, eyeshadow to match your costume, blush, and of course bright lipstick. It's okay if it seems heavy, as it is much harder to see from the audience. Proper stage makeup will accentuate your features and make your face and expression stand out, and it can make a difference in the way the audience sees your performance.

, Whether your costume is an elaborate dress or simply jeans and a T-shirt, make sure it fits well and allows you total freedom of movement. Try it on and practice your routine with it a couple of days before the performance, so you'll know if you have to make any costume changes. Before the performance, get dressed and warm up in your costume to make sure everything fits as planned. Keep a couple of safety pins on hand in case anything goes wrong.

, It is always important to be confident in yourself. Don't let the nerves get to you. You know that you can do your routine because you practiced (and practiced, and practiced, and practiced). This is your chance to shine and show people how talented you are. If you mess up just keep on going. The audience doesn't know the routine, and they won't have a clue. The best thing about going up on stage by yourself? Nobody can tell if you're doing it wrong.

, Don't contort your face with the effort of a difficult move. A dancer's job is to perform and make even the most difficult of moves appear effortless and graceful. Take pride in your performance.

, As difficult or stressful as your solo might be, know that you've put a lot of work into it and deserve to enjoy it. Dancing should be fun, so once you're onstage, relax, put all the work and stress behind you, and simply enjoy the dance.

Send out invitations three to four weeks prior to the event.,
If you have a tight budget, then don't provide a lot of food for your guests.,
Music is an easy one, just create a playlist with all the 'in' music on it.,
When the day of the dance comes, you may want to decorate and prepare for it on that day.,
Remember one thing whilst the dance is going on, have fun!

",How to Plan a Dance," Planning a dance can seem like a really great idea when you first get it, but be prepared to commit fully and get organized. Sometimes it's more helpful and fun to plan with a friend.;
, Remember, this is your chance to be original. You could do whatever you want, it could just be a casual-dress if you like, but you may have to consider what others would like the theme to be as well. They are the people who you're trying to please!

, A venue is another thing you must plan for well in advance. It isn't recommended to have a dance in someone's house, as you don't have as much freedom as you might want. Make sure you check out the venue before the dance, you don't want any nasty surprises on the night!

, Just anyone who you know will make a good impact on the dance, you don't want any party-poopers or people you don't really know well. It's up to you if you want it to be a girl-boy dance, where everyone comes with a partner. If not it will be just as fun with all of your girl/guy friends there!

, This will give your guests plenty of time to rearrange any other plans in the way. Invitations don't have to be anything special, it could just be an email if you wanted it to be! Just remember to mention the where, when and dress code.

, Just mention in the invitation that they should eat beforehand. You should still provide lots of drinks and snacks though.

, If people are coming with partners, you may want to create a slow-dance-tune for near the end of the dance.

, Give yourself an hour or so for you to get ready then make sure you are back at the venue at least 45 minutes before the guests arrive.

",How to Become a Disney Channel Star," One of the prime ingredients for any rising Disney star is the ability to act. It's not that hard, when you think about it—you act every day. Sometimes you act innocent when your parents ask you about something you might have done but don't want to admit it. Sometimes you act really strong, when you're scared to death. You'll need more than this for Disney, though. If you're serious about wanting to become a Disney Channel star, try these things:


Audition for every school or community play you can. Professional theatre companies will even hire children, if they are right for the part (and their parent's consent). The more acting experience you have on your resume, the greater your chances to land an audition for the Disney Channel.
Take acting lessons. Find an actor who can teach, check their references, and start the process of learning the craft of acting. Who couldn't benefit from learning to cry on cue?
Join the Drama Club. The more time you spend with the acting community, the more of an actor you will become.;
, You may do this in the shower, or with your headphones on, but are you confident in your voice? Whether you are or not, the goal is to impress Disney Channel executives, who have seen and heard it all. You want to make sure you're the real deal, so try these steps to get there:


Take voice lessons. Not only will this help you develop your skills as a singer, it will also make you a better actor. How? By learning to control your voice to a fine degree, you'll be able to project any tone or volume you need for your roles on stage. Practice diligently.
Sing in the choir. It may be the school choir, or community choir, or a simple church choir. It doesn't matter, as long as you are singing in a group. Singing in a choir will help you learn to listen to others, and match your pitch to other singers. If you have a city or regional orchestra, or professional choirs, consider auditioning there as well.

, You probably do this already, too. Like acting and singing, it's something most people do all the time—just not professionally. To really present to the Disney staff a well-rounded talent, adding a strong dance card only makes you look better.


Take ballet lessons. It may not be your favorite dance style, but ballet teaches a body discipline that will serve you well throughout your life. It will lend a certain refined grace to your movements, even when you are not dancing.
Take modern dance lessons. This will help further your dancing talent by exposing you to unusual, thought-provoking routines and bold movements. You might like the music better, too!
Take gymnastics or martial arts classes. Learn to do moves that are not dance related, but will teach your body to move in strong, confident ways. The more control you have over every fiber of muscle in your body, the better prepared you will be for an audition with Disney.

, Work out a routine that includes all the skills you have, and practice it until it becomes second nature to you. Push yourself in all areas, so that you have a really great performance piece that will wow the Disney audition staff.


Although this isn't the Olympics, it would still be useful to have a coach—somebody who can help you perfect your routine, and can let you know where you're doing well—and where you need improvement. Check with your teacher at school, or the person giving you acting lessons. If they're not interested, they may have ideas about who would be.

, No audition is complete without one, and the folks at Disney are not an exception. The better the photo you include, the better you will present yourself.


You can have a friend snap a picture of you
Better still, go to the local photo portrait store in the mall, where they have professional lighting and backdrops.
Better than either of those is the professional portrait photographer. They not only have the professional equipment, they specialize in portraits and headshots. Check with your school to see who is doing the Senior Portraits in town, and check them out. If there are several, check out their rates and availability, and tell them what you're looking for.
Make sure your headshot is current, and printed on standard letter-sized paper. If you change your appearance before your audition, make sure to update your headshot, too.

, You will need this to show people your experience, your talents, and your goals. In combination with your head shot, it will speak for you when you're not there, so make it as engaging, thorough, and complete as you can.


Your resume should only be one page, listing your most recent experience and accomplishments. Don't worry if you have limited experience—Disney is looking for the best, not the busiest.
Attach your resume to the back of your headshot, or print it right on the back of your picture. You will leave this package behind after your audition. Remember, it's your calling card—it's how they will remember you, so make it the best representation of ""you"" that you can make it.

, There are a lot of them listed, around the world. Not only will the list tell you what you might be right for—it will also tell you what they are looking for, in case you want to broaden your skill set.

Start with a firm frame.,
Stand close together, but not so close that you're going to trip over each other.,
Have the lead place their right hand on the follow's left shoulder blade.,
Have the follows put their left arm over the lead's right arm, and position it so that there is as much contact between the two arms as possible.,
Hold your partner's other hand when the move requires it.,
Maintain a 'pulse' for any move you do in the Lindy Hop.",How to Lindy Hop1," Both the lead and the follow need to maintain a firm frame. This will help you maintain the connection and stretch necessary to communicate with your partner, as well as protecting you from injury. Stand up tall with your shoulders slightly back and your elbows at your sides. Your arms will move but it's important to keep yourself standing tall with your shoulders positioned slightly back.


One way to get the correct frame is to mime taking a heavy box off a shelf which is above your head. Hold the imaginary box in front of your chest. Your shoulders should now be in position.
If you keep your frame rigid you're not going to be able to dance, but you need to keep it firm so you can maintain a connection and create 'stretch' with your partner once you connect up. This takes practice!;
, For the basic connection, the lead should stand to the left of the follow. You should also not be standing in a straight line, rather you should be slightly angled towards each other (but not facing).


Imagine there is a beach ball sitting between you and your partner. If you aren't angled towards each other enough the ball will fall, and if you try to face to much towards each other, the ball will stop you.
When you connect up with your partner in the next few steps, you need to make sure you stay at the same angle as you are now.

, Apply a light pressure on the follow's back - not so much that you're pushing them, but enough that they would notice a significant difference if you took your hand away.


You will need to adjust where you put your hand depending on who you're dancing with. your partner may be taller than you, shorter than you, and the length of your arm might sit on a different place on their back. Find a place that's comfortable and gives you a solid connection without straining you or your partner too far.
Try not to have a completely flat hand. Shape it like a cup so it's easier for the follow to feel and easier for you to manipulate .
The follow should sit back into this hand ever so slightly so it's more obvious if it moves.

, This will strengthen your connection.


Don't aim to put your hand on the lead's shoulder. If you are dancing with somebody who is taller than you you're going to get very sore very quickly. To find the position, put your arm over the lead's and let it hang down (the lead's arm should be between your arm and your body). Then bend it at the elbow to meet the corresponding point on the lead's arm.

, Even when you don't need to, it can be a good way to make sure your connection is maintained and can be a stylistic choice too. Hold your partner's hand loosely in yours, in a relaxed position near your bodies.


Make sure it's easy to let go of their hand when you're doing moves. Interlocking your fingers will make this very difficult.
It's not like many ballroom dances where you have to hold your arms straight out. Lindy Hop is a relaxed dance so you can hold it just in front of you.

, This is a slight bounce in your knees on every beat. The pulse will help you keep your connection to the music and keep your balance.


It can be tempting at first to bounce on every other beat, especially with fast music, but to stay in time you need to pulse on every single beat.

Understand the rules.,
Present yourself well.,
Bring your wallet.,
Don't talk to her about your problems.,
Control yourself.,
Be reasonable.,
Leave a tip.",How to Practice Lap Dance Etiquette," Observe and pay attention to the signs. Oftentimes, strip clubs have a no touching rule, and you have to understand that you are not an exemption.


Never abuse the stripper. Oftentimes, strip clubs have many guards and you will be asked to leave.;
, Pay attention to your clothes, breath and smell. Many venues require tucked in shirts and pants. Just because someone is a stripper does not mean that you can turn up in your track pants or shorts and smell like garbage; instead, think of it as going on a date. In return, the better you dress yourself up, the more she will be into you.


Often, people have a tendency to overdo colognes and deodorant. Don't be one of those people.

, Lap dances are pricy, so load your wallet up with cash. You won't want to be in the situation where you are pleading for a second lap dance to find that you have no money.


Dancers are cash only, however most venues have ATMs.

, Stripers aren't paid to be a therapist, so don't go on about your job or ex. Just enjoy the moment.

, Unless told otherwise, keep your hands to yourself. If you really can't resist the temptation to grab her body, ask her politely.

, It's okay to ask her to rub your private area, but asking her for role playing or for her to wear something is unacceptable. Lap dancers are just paid to dance, if you would like something more sexually exciting, hire a prostitute.


Some dancers may offer more than a dance, but don't expect more if she doesn't offer it.

, She is there to make money, so don't expect that she enjoys it. You should at least tip about 10% and remember that the more money you give her, the more you get out of it! You may also get a discount if you arrive early and pay for drinks or be charged more when sharing with a friend.

Step out to the left or right side.,
Make sure your arms are out to either side with a slight bend.

,
Pull your legs together.,
Move your arms into a circle, like hugging a bear.

,
Step back out, facing the direction from the beginning.

,
Open your arms to either side.

",How to Perform the Chaine Turn Dance Move1," Make sure your toe is pointed to your side but not sickled, meaning the entire leg is straight.;
,, At this point you should be facing the opposite direction you were before.

,,,"
"
Have the lead start the move by falling back onto their left foot on the first count, then stepping back onto their right on the second count.,
Take a big step forward.,
After stepping onto your foot on count four, let your other foot naturally swing forward.,
You've completed the Charleston basic!",How to Lindy Hop2," This is called the rockstep and is what gives you forward momentum to do the next steps. When the follow feels the lead initiate the rockstep, they do the same, only stepping backwards onto their right foot and forwards onto the left.


Keep your feet more or less underneath you. The further backwards you step, the harder it will be to move forward into the next step and you will lose your momentum.
The follow will know the lead has initiated the rockstep because the lead's arm will press backwards into their arm, and the lead's hand will move ever so slightly backwards.
Think of this step like an athlete building up to run.

, Ideally you will rise up on count three and come down on count four (it's important that you don't put your foot down until count four.) Leads will step onto their left foot and follows onto their right.


The upward motion in this step is important to differentiate it from other basics.
Leads need to make sure they bring their arms forward along with their body so the follow knows where to go.

, Don't step onto it, and don't rush it. By count 8, it should be slightly behind you, and just before count one of the next bar, step onto it.


Be careful not to lose your balance by trying to 'kick' your foot out forwards, or step back onto it too early. Let your body flow naturally.
That being said, this is a great time to add some extra style into your step!

, Now you can repeat it, go into another basic, or do something entirely different!

"
"
Have the lead start by leading a rockstep, the exact same way as for the Charleston basic.,
Starting with your outside foot (the one away from your partner), do a triple step.,
On count five, take a step with your inside foot, and on count six take one with your outside foot.,
On counts seven and eight, do another triple step, starting on your inside foot.,
Repeat the step, do a different basic, or something else.

",How to Lindy Hop3,"


At this point, your follower won't know which basic you're intending to do, so once you've done the rockstep, exaggerate the motion of the next one.

, This is where you basically take three steps in two counts (three-four).


Try counting this as three-and-four and stepping on each of those words.
Leads should lead this as something of a downward motion to distinguish it from the Charleston basic.
You won't have time to do whole steps here, so don't try to. Keep them small and stay in time with the music.

,


You can step forwards, backwards, or on the spot, but the lead needs to make it clear to the follower which way they're stepping by leading with their whole body so the follow can follow.
In many ways, this is similar to the rockstep.

, For the basic step this should go backwards and you should end up more or less where you started.

,"
"
Have the lead start the same way as the 8 count basic, with a rockstep and a triple step forward.,
Instead of stepping forwards, go straight into a triple step backwards.,
Finish on the 6th count even though most swing music is danced to bars of 8 counts.",How to Lindy Hop4," You should finish the triple step forward on count four.


Leads should remember to lead the next part strongly so the follow can distinguish between the 6 count and the 8 count.

, You should finish this in the place you started, on count 6.


This is the place where follows are most likely to lose their balance, by thinking it's an 8 count and losing the connection with the lead. If this happens, don't fret! Just regain your balance and keep on dancing.

, This doesn't actually matter, you just do your next step (which can be a repeat of the 6 count, a different basic, or something else, you know the drill) on count 7, rather than count 1.


It can be confusing starting steps two counts 'early' because you can't rely on counting it in blocks of eight, but you'll get used to it in no time!

Stand straight in a corner of a room.,
Open your outside arm so both of your arms are straight.,
Put your weight only on the outside foot and swoop it around, carrying your other foot with it.,
Find your spot.",How to Perform the Chaine Turn Dance Move2," Point towards the front of the room (tendu) using your outside foot. Lift your inside arm slightly and use it to help you pivot. Point the outside foot to the side and put weight on it. You should now be facing the side.

, Your arms should be facing the wall like you're about to give it a hug.

, While doing this, close both of your arms so the palms face your belly button.

, This means that you must pick an object such as a dot or clock on the other wall that you are turning towards. Keep your eyes on the object while you are turning and once you can't keep your eyes on it any longer, turn your head and find that object again.

Put on something you can move in such as a T-shirt, tank top, crop top, sports bra, yoga pants, a pair of shorts or you could even wear your dance wear if you have any.;
, Having hair hitting your face isn't fun and you could also possibly injure yourself if your hair is blocking your eyes. Do your hair in a quick hairstyles such as a ponytail, bun, braid, or even pigtails. Wear a headband for extra support and make your hairstyle as tight as possible so it doesn't undo itself but not too tight to the point that it's uncomfortable.

, Performing a dance trick especially a leap without stretching may result in pulling a muscle. Prepare your body by doing the splits or over splits if you're advanced enough, doing lunges, doing the pancake stretch, jogging on the spot or anything else that will stretch out your legs. Do each stretch or warm up for a minute or two for best results.

, Wearing a pair of socks will make it easier to do the leap however, if the floor you will be doing the leap on is already easy to turn on you won't need to wear anything on your feet.

, You don't want to crash into a wall when practicing you calypso. Try to use a room that has enough space and has little to no furniture. Can't find a big enough room? No problem! Go outside in your backyard or use your front yard.

, Create a v like shape with your feet making sure your feet are shoulder width apart. One arm should be in a circle and the other arm should be straight. Have the arm in the circle be your bad leg (left arm in circle if left leg is bad leg.)

, Point your bad leg in front keeping your good leg behind to tendu.

, With the leg in tendu move it to the side and put your weight on it make sure to straighten both arms when beginning the chaine. Then bring your other leg into second position and turn around.

, After doing a high chaine do another chaine but this time do it lower by bending your legs this will give you power when doing the jump.

, With the leg in front do a ronde de jambe to the corner then open your leg to the side. Push off your back leg as soon as the front leg is high enough making sure it's in attitude by bending your back leg as soon as you push off. Push of your back leg as hard as you can to get more height your arms can be lifted over your head or any position you want.

, You can either do a roll or land it standing. If you're a beginner then it's best to land standing before you attempt doing a roll.

, Go into your splits and have your front leg straight out with your back leg bent in attitude. Position your hands straight up in the air or any position you feel comfortable with. Do this exercise on a soft surface rather than a hard surface to prevent injuries.

, Having your splits on at least one leg will help improve not just a calypso leap but other dance leaps as well. Everyday do stretches such as lunges and other leg stretches and you'll have your splits in no time.

, Seeing the way you look when doing a calypso will give you knowledge on what you can improve on. Use a large mirror in your house or use an empty dance studio room.

, Have someone record you several times and compare the videos to see if you did better or worse.

, Search up a video or two of professional dancer doing calypso leaps to see their technique and improve on yours.

, Create a fun short dance routine and incorporate a calypso leap along with other dance moves.

, Show your leap to a dancer that can do a calypso or to your dance teacher. They can help you and give you tips.

Develop your unique skill and talents.,
Read up on acting.",How to Be an Actress1," Acting classes will help you discover your strengths as an actress. Some actresses excel at drama, while others are natural comedians. You might discover that performing Shakespeare is your calling, or that musical theatre is for you. In any case, acting classes teach you to develop and inhabit your character, work with other actors and take direction.


Improvisation classes are a good place to start. Many people immediately think of comedy when they hear the word ""improv,"" but improvisation classes actually teach essential skills for dramatic acting, too. Improvisational acting trains you to pay attention to cues and respond quickly. You'll learn to naturally react to others' prompts and silence your inner critic.
Acting workshops will help you understand the craft of acting from a different angle, through ""scene studies."" Typically, you'll be assigned a few parts in from a few scenes, which you'll practice over an entire semester. You'll participate in class discussions about the meaning of the scene and the intentions of the screenwriter or playwright. Finally, you'll be subject to critiques, and you'll be able to put the skills that you learn into practice right away.
When you advance past basic acting classes, you'll have the option to take specialized classes for film or stage acting, which require different skills. Experiment with both to figure out which suits you best.
You may enroll in an acting program at a university and pursue a degree in acting, but if you're not ready to commit to an intensive program yet, try taking a few classes at your local community college or theater arts school.;
, There are numerous approaches to acting, each of which offer insight and training into accessing and portraying emotion.


The Stanislavski Method is a step-by-step method to building character, and includes script analysis. Stanslavski-trained actresses include Stella Adler and Marilyn Monroe.
The Meisner Technique focuses on action-based character development and actor response. Meisner actresses include Tina Fey, Jessica Walter and Naomi Watts.
Method Acting involves adopting the behaviors and mindset of your character, and immersing yourself in your character for the duration of the production. Method actresses include Kate Winslet, Natalie Portman and Tippi Hedren.

, Once you’ve identified your strengths as an actress and the type of career you’d like to pursue, study the greats. If you want to work in the film industry, watch movies with stars like Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Judi Dench. If sketch comedy is your goal, catch up on shows like Saturday Night Live. And if you’d like to be a stage actress, visit your local theatre and take in plays regularly.

, Your daily interactions offer great training. Studying emotional responses to various situations helps you develop your emotional range, while studying facial expressions, speech patterns and body language gives you ideas and tools for creating character and for performance.

, You never know when there’s going to be a casting call for an actress who speaks French, plays the piano, juggles or does back-flips. It’s good to have an arsenal of unique talents with which you can distinguish yourself. Likewise, you might find that you can use them to give a character depth and dimension.

, There many fantastic books that offer invaluable advice for aspiring and working actors. These books include:

Memorize several monologues.,
Get headshots.,
Get a demo reel.,
Find a talent agent.,
Get your SAG-AFTRA card, or your Actors Equity Card.",How to Be an Actress2," Always have two to five monologues ready to perform. You never know when a call is going to come up, and it’s best to be prepared rather than cramming at the last minute.


Make sure that the monologues are distinct. If one is dramatic, the other should be comedic. Likewise, it’s good to have one modern work and one classic or Shakespearean monologue.
You'll stand out more if you choose unique monologues. Look through books and films for monologues that will allow you to showcase your special talent; chances are, they won't be the same ones the casting director has seen a hundred times before.

, You need them to get an agent, as well as to audition at open casting calls.


Work with a professional photographer who specializes in acting and performance headshots, and make sure that he or she will provide make-up and hair styling.
Know your type. Roles are written for certain looks and types, and you should have photos that meet these casting criteria. If your look and acting-age is “high school cheerleader,” include that look in your photo package. Likewise, if you’d make a great vampire, suburban mom or mob-wife, have photos taken that capture that aspect of your look and acting-age.
Get electronic copies of your headshots. Some agencies may ask you to email your resume and headshots.
Make sure your printed headshots are the same size as your resume. If you plan on printing your resume on standard 8 1/2"" x 11"" paper, your headshot should be the same size. It looks more professional this way.

, A demo reel is footage that showcases your acting work. Make sure your plays are filmed, and prearrange with directors to use the work in your reel. The site www.productionapprentice.com/tutorials/general/create-a-winning-demo-reel-that-people-will-actually-watch/ has great tips on how to cater your demo reel to each casting director.

, It's important to get a franchised, licensed agent. Many people who are not agents will claim to be. Real agents are licensed by the state, and generally receive 10% of your earnings.


A great way to meet an agent is to attend a casting workshop. A casting workshop is an opportunity for actors to audition in front of a number of agents and casting directors. You do have to pay to participate, but it’s a fantastic way to get your name and face out there. Do an online search for casting workshops in your area.
The Call Sheet, which can be accessed at www.backstage.com, has a list of reputable talent agents. The SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) website, www.sagaftra.org, also has lists of agents.

,


SAG-AFTRA is the screen actors’ labor union. SAG-AFTRA can get you higher paying (and higher profile gigs), provides health insurance and makes sure that your work is not misused. It also opens the door to more audition opportunities, as agents have access to union calls.
Actors’ Equity is the stage actors’ union. Again, it provides health insurance, and ensures fair wages and decent working conditions for stage actors. Equity actors also get to participate in workshops and seminars, and again have access to a greater number of auditions.

Aim to audition as often as you can. Even when you don't get the role, it's great practice.

, Prepare to read a monologue that seems in sync with the role you're auditioning for. Remember that you should have several monologues prepared in case you are asked to read more than one.


Dress appropriately for the role. If you're reading the part of a businesswoman, wear a suit and dress shoes.

, You may be given material that you're asked to read without practicing first. You can prepare for this beforehand by reading a variety of screenplays and monologues. Practice with a friend to simulate the experience of reading in front of an audience.

, Auditioning is about being judged, and, very often, rejected. Sometimes you’ll do a great job, but you weren’t what they were looking for. Other times, you just might flub your lines. Learn to shake it off and keep going. And remember, even if they don’t hire you, casting directors are sympathetic to how hard it is to audition.

, Auditioning will be a part of your acting career from beginning to end. Treat it as part of your job. As you begin to take roles, use what you learned the next time you audition. It may be years before you're able to make a living as an actress, but be persistent. As you polish your skills and learn more about your craft, more opportunities will be open to you.

You may also need to reassure them that you won’t neglect your other responsibilities, such as school and chores, just because you’re pursuing acting.Don’t tell your parents that you want to become an actor just because you want to be famous or rich. Have some good reasons ready, such as you love telling stories or have fun creating characters, so they’ll take you seriously.;
, While you may have natural talent, it always helps to hone your skills, so you’re well-prepared when you start to go on auditions. A school drama class is a good place to start, but specialized classes and workshops in specific acting areas, such as commercial acting or acting for the camera, are more impressive to list on your resume.If you don’t have time during the school year to take acting classes, a summer drama camp may be a good alternative.
If you want personalized acting instruction, you might talk to your parents about hiring an acting coach who can work with you one-on-one to improve your skills.

, While you probably won’t be able to get a professional acting job right out of the gate, you’ll want potential agents and casting directors to know that you have experience performing. Look for local opportunities to act (such as school plays, regional theater, and student films) so you have some roles to put on your resume.Try to play a large variety of types of roles. Doing so will it give you an opportunity to stretch your acting skills and will also showcase your impressive acting range to casting directors.

, When you go to meet with potential agents and casting directors, you’ll need to provide a photo. They must be professional photos, though, so you should go to a photographer who specializes in taking photos of children and teens. Make sure to ask for both commercial and theatrical headshots, so you’re ready for both advertising work and film, television, and theater opportunities.It’s important to choose the right photographer for your headshots. Ask for recommendations if you have friends or acquaintances in the acting field. Otherwise, visit websites for photographers in your area, and study their online portfolios to get an idea of the quality of their work.

, While you may be able to book some small acting jobs with just your parents’ help, having an agent is crucial if you really want to build a successful acting career. Not only will an agent know the ins and outs of the business so they can guide you in the right direction, they’ll have connections with casting directors and producers that make it easier to get auditions.To find an agent, research the top talent agencies in your area. You want to make sure that you’re working with a reputable agent, who doesn’t ask for any money upfront.
Many talent agencies allow you to apply online. However, it’s a good idea to meet with a potential agent in person before you and your parents commit to working with them.
If you live in a rural area where it's difficult to find an agent, that doesn't mean you can't act. It just means that you need to look for work through trade publications, such as Backstage, and online casting sites, so you can identify local acting opportunities.
In some cases, agents won't take you on as a client until you have some professional acting credits to your name. You may want to find a few jobs on your own (or with your parents' help) before trying to land an agent.

, If you’re under 18, many states require a permit to work in the entertainment industry. For example, California and New York, where many acting opportunities are available, have specific requirements that regulate how child actors may be used. Your agent should know the laws in your state, but you can also visit your state’s labor department website to find out if you need a permit in your state.In most cases, a form is required to get a work permit. You’ll need to provide parental consent, as well as other information depending on the state. Your health and school records are usually required.

, While your agent will be on the lookout for acting opportunities that fit your skills, you can also do some research yourself. Sites such as Casting Frontier, Actors Access, and L.A. Casting provide casting and audition information for projects that are currently in the process of filling roles. You can usually submit yourself for consideration directly, but it’s a good idea to discuss potential roles with your agent.These sites usually charge a fee, so you’ll need to discuss joining them with your parents.

, Whether you have an agent or not, it's important to find as many ways to market yourself as an actor as possible, especially if you don't live in L.A. or New York, where most acting opportunities are. Make videos for YouTube that demonstrate your acting skills -- there's no guarantee casting directors or agents will see your videos, but you never know when one will go viral.


Videos of school play and regional theater performances are ideal content for your YouTube channel. Local commercials or TV appearances are also a good idea because agents or casting directors outside your area probably haven't seen them.
If you're feeling creative, you can also post original short films that help showcase your acting ability.

, While most auditions will have a specific scene or group of scenes that you are required to perform, you may sometimes be asked to come up with your own material. That’s why it’s a good idea to work on a monologue or two, so you’ll always be ready when an audition comes up. Make sure to choose a piece that really allows you to showcase your acting skills.If you’re not sure what monologue(s) to prepare, consider some of your favorite movies -- there’s bound to be a piece in one of them that will work.
It’s usually best to choose an age-appropriate monologue. If possible, find one that’s delivered by character who’s as close to you in age as possible.

, In many cases, the casting company will send you a script or “sides,” which are just the portion of the script that pertain to the character that you’re reading for, in advance of the audition. Don’t just glance at your lines a couple of times to try memorize them -- make an effort to understand the character and figure out the best way to play the scene.Many casting directors won’t mind if you hold your script or sides during your audition. However, it’s best if you don’t read directly from it. Instead, just glance at it occasionally to remind yourself of the lines.

, If you really want an acting career, you must take every audition seriously. While you may not have a job yet, you should act like a professional, so the casting director is comfortable working with you. That means being open to any suggestions that he or she might make and being willing to do the scene several times to get it right.Make sure to project confidence during your audition. If you don’t believe that you’re good enough for the part, the casting director probably won’t either.

, Acting is an extremely competitive business, even for children. As a result, you’re probably going to go on many auditions that don’t end in a job -- but that doesn’t mean you should lose faith in your skills as an actor. As with most things, practice makes perfect, so the more you audition, the better you’ll become at impressing casting directors.If you realize at some point that you’re no longer having fun pursuing an acting career, talk to your parents. You shouldn’t keep at it if it only makes you feel bad about yourself.

Find auditions.",How to Start to Perform in Theatre," Do you really want to act for the acting, or do you want to act for the ""fame perks""? If you just want the perks, you're out of luck. What you really need for the Theatre is passion- even if you don't make it past off broad way, you should be in it for the fun and passion. Not the fun of riding to the dentist in a private jet.;
, Here are some common myths, busted;


Most performer-wannabes think that you need an ""expensive"" agent to perform at a community theatre. If you're one of those people, you are very wrong. Agents work with professional actors that have been performing locally for a VERY long time to find them professional auditions. Agents do NOT cost a penny up front! If you ever get to the point where you're looking for an agent, please remember; if they ask for anything up front, DO NOT GO TO THAT AGENT! They are a SCAM. Agents work for you to find YOU work, and then they take 10% from your pay. Clear? Good
Community theatre does not get you discovered. community theatre prepares you, teaches you technique in a relaxed setting, and gets you used to auditioning, rehearsing, and performing, but with less pressure.

, You must know before you talk to them, that you will need all of the training required. A few basics are:


Dance. Jazz is best for theatre, but ballet, tap, modern, and lyrical can also be very useful.
Voice lessons. These are crucial, because if you don't get the proper training, you could damage your voice.
Be ready to pay for part of this yourself if your parents won't. There are plenty of professional actors who were from middle, or even low-class families and worked to pay for their training. Be prepared, because all the classes can get pricey.

, Tell them about all of the necessities. Be mature and calm, but firm, so that you can get all the training you need without upsetting them. If you act out or give them an attitude, they may not think you're serious about this. Show them all of the research you've done on reputable classes, suitable teachers, and most importantly; your passion. If your parents give you a flat out “no” to paying for all of this stuff, think in their shoes. All of these classes are expensive. Reason with them. Join drama club at school to get a feel for what theatre is like.

, Ask any of your instructors(voice, dance, or even that crazy drama club teacher if they know of any groups, shows, or theaters that are looking for your ""type"". If they don't know about anything, look online, or check bulletin boards. Once you find an audition, see related wikiHow's on how to audition.

Eat a good breakfast.",How to Prepare for a Dance Show," Organize them in the order you will be performing them. This will help you keep in mind a system and you will be able to transition easier from dance to dance.

If your dance teacher or studio gives you a schedule, then you can simply highlight the dance or dances that you will be in, and keep that with you.;
, If you have a list of things you'll need, then you'll be a lot less likely to forget any costumes or props. If you made a list for your dances, then you can include this on your list of dances and write the costumes needed for each out to the side, or create an entirely separate list for this. Make sure to include all costumes including shoes and accessories and any make up changes. List each dance and the things needed for that dance separately instead of all your materials needed for the entire show in one general list.

, Put the costumes in your bag according to the order in which you will be performing the dance, making sure the first dance’s costumes are on top. You may also use the zip-lock bag method and divide your costumes into zip-lock bags and label them according to which dance they correspond to. Separate accessories into smaller zip-lock bags and keep them with the costumes they belong to.

, Being organized is just a way to help you focus on the bigger picture of what the show is all about, your dancing. Make sure you feel prepared and ready for every dance you’ll be performing, and you'll likely be a lot less nervous (if you are), because you'll already have your dances memorized in your head.

, Don’t wait until the last minute to get organized or practice your routines. Get all your costumes together a day ahead so that you aren’t stressed out when the day of your performance comes.

, Some of the best foods are oatmeal, a high fiber cereal, strawberries and bananas. One way to combine all of these is to make a strawberry and banana smoothie, and eat a bowl of the cereal or oatmeal. If the performance is after lunch and/or dinner, you should make healthy choices in those meals as well.

Taking drama in high school, for example, will give you an introduction into many of these key acting areas. Make sure to audition or register, depending on what’s required.


Famous Actresses can be stars of stage or screen. Voice only work is common too such as radio or movie voiceover rolls.Taking drama in school can improve interpersonal skills, as well as, mental, physical, and emotional development., Stage and screen acting are in very different environments.Stage acting is a performance in front of a live audience.

Schedule performances with the facilities you wish to perform at.",How to Start a Theatre Group,"  Your target audience will pave the path for all other aspects of starting your theatre group.  You need to think about who you want to perform to before you know what you want to perform.;
,  Ask yourself what you are performing for.  For example, are you performing to brighten the day of elderly people?  Or cheer up children in a cancer ward?  Or maybe both?  Selecting the goal of your group makes the rest of the process even easier.

,  Now that you know who you want to perform for and why you are doing it, picking a name should be a bit easier.  You can think of many different types of names.  A suggestion would be an acronym, like ""ABC"" (Actors Believing in Change).  Make a list of possibilities and then narrow it down to the most meaningful.

,  Grab a laptop, computer, or smartphone that has internet access and research places based off of you desired audience.  For example, if your target audience was nursing homes and children's hospitals, then you should find places near you that allow performances to be held.


Make sure to take note of the phone numbers so you can contact the performance spaces later

, Look on the facility's website and learn about their mission and goals. Making sure your goals are compatible with your performance space can be vital to your success.

,  Once you have picked a few possible performance areas, write down phone numbers so you can call them at a later time to ask about qualifications to perform.  For example, they may need you to fill out paperwork as a volunteer, talk about scheduling days, and if there are any restrictions about what you can perform.

,  Now that you have basic details, go find your cast!  Think of anyone you may know that can sing, act, and/or dance and make a list to contact them.  If you wish, you can also post on social media to see if anyone would be interested in joining.


Be clear from the get-go about how you intend the group to work. If decisions are going to be collaborative, encourage your members to chime in and make choices together. This applies to all of the following steps, too. If you plan, instead, to run the show yourself, make sure the know that and are okay with it.

,  Someone in your group is bound to have some sort of access to an area big enough to use as a practice space (i.e. empty pole barn, family dance studio or recreational center, or even a large basement).

,  Every group looks more professional if they have appropriate and/or matching attire.  Look at the name of your theatre group and figure out how you can transform it into a shirt design.  For example, if your name is ""ABC"" (Actors Believing in Change), then you could stack ""ABC"" blocks on top of each other and then finish the words across the page.

,  Depending on the size of your cast, you may be able to get volunteers to drive to and from performances.  Make a list of the people that can drive and how many people can fit into each of their cars.  If not enough of your cast can drive, you may need to consider other options such as, taking a bus.

,  Make note of which form of choreography you wish to use next to each of your possible performance pieces.  There are several types of choreography you could use:


Stationary (choir-style)
Staged (used in skits, minor blocking of steps)
Moderate (minimal choreography while staying focused on singing)
""Full-blown"" (complete dance numbers with minimal to no focus on vocals)

, Having props for certain performance pieces can make the impact of the piece that much greater.  Make sure to have access to these props for your cast to practice with well before actual performances.


You may not know all of the props you need now because you have not made the actual choreography yet. That is ok, just keep a running list as you go.

,  Think back at your audiences and divide your list of songs into separate lists for each of those audiences.  For example, you would not want to perform the song ""Ain't No Mountain"" to a bunch of five year olds, but that would be a perfect song to perform at a nursing home.


This is subject to change based on time constraints of the performances and how long each piece is.

, Look at your list of possible performance pieces and start to make your choreography.


You will need advanced experience or another experienced person to choreograph for you.
You can read How to Choreograph a Dance to aide you in the process.

, You will need to hold many practices in order to get performance ready. Make sure to pick days and times during the week in which the majority, if not all, of your cast can attend.


Make sure to make the practices long enough to where entire pieces can be taught and learned in one day. This helps get your group performance ready as fast as possible.

, Contact the facilities you have chosen to perform at and write down any available dates they have. Make sure to check the dates with your cast and then quickly get back with the facility. Now that you have scheduled performances, and have practiced to the peak of being performance ready, you are ready to perform.

Remember to stay relaxed.",How to Study Method Acting," Enrolling in an institution that specializes in method acting will provide you with classes, resources, and information about the history and techniques of method acting. Most programs also offer hands-on experience through class led performances as well as school wide performances. Another benefit of enrolling in a method acting program is the community of others who share similar interests, which can lead to further developments in your acting.The Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute is the founding method acting institution.;
, There are many local classes available that do not require you to be enrolled in an acting school. Classes that are not institutionally associated can also have a wide variety of skill levels and interests creating a more diverse environment. Taking classes will allow you to get more professional advice and information about method acting without having to manage going to school while having other obligations.


Look for classes and teachers who teach method acting through online acting resources, like takelessons., Your local theater community can be another useful resource for learning and discussing method acting and its techniques. Local theater communities are often made of individuals who are not professional actors and are still learning new skills and techniques.


Reach out to the head of your local theater and see what resources they offer. Ask them questions like, “I’m trying to learn method acting, do you have any advice?” “Do you offer any classes or resources on method acting?” or “Are there rehearsals that are open to the public?”

, Relaxation is the key principle of method acting, which allows you to fully enter your role and perform to the best of your ability. Spend time relaxing before trying any exercises or acting scenes. Try to relax each part of your body individually at slow increments. The more relaxed you are the more you will be able to employ the techniques of method acting.T’ai Chi is a great practice to adopt for relaxing your entire body in a methodical and contemplative way.
Try meditation or yoga techniques to further relax your body and mind before warming up and practicing your method acting.

, Sense memory is the practice of trying to tap into memories of your senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste. Try thinking of a memory and concentrating on the different sensory experiences of that memory. One popular exercise that has to do with using sense memory is called the “personal object exercise,” which has the student explore an object that has personal significance to them with each one of their senses.Sense memory takes a lot of concentration and patience. Remember to practice slowly and not rush yourself. Give yourself time to fully explore your memory or object.

, This exercise is generally for more experienced method actors as it can often be triggering or overwhelming. The purpose of thinking about your own personal emotional memories is to use your sense memory to be able to explore a personal memory and use that emotion in another character. For example, if the character you are trying to play has experienced loss, you would think about a memory in which you experienced loss and explore it using all of your senses.Only perform this exercise with an experienced teacher if you are new to method acting and have not used your own emotional experiences in exercises.

, Embodying your subject, or characterization, is the practice of imagining yourself as someone or something else. Spend time observing your subject and how they engage with their surroundings before you begin this exercise. After observing your subject use your sense memory to begin to explore your environment in the ways your subject would.Try choosing an animal as your first subject if you haven’t practiced this exercise before. Choosing an animal will help exaggerate the techniques used in this exercise.

, There are many games that employ the techniques required to successfully perform method acting. Games that use method acting techniques will allow you to externalize the skills the techniques are aiming to teach you. Try playing a game at the end of each practicing session to try out new skills and refine old ones.Many websites for method acting classes also offer examples of games that can be played that use method acting techniques., Sense memory exercises will help you recreate and inhabit emotional spaces that can comprehensively account for all of the senses. When you know who or what your character is, like a recently divorced husband, a little girl on her fourth birthday, or a werewolf, use sense memory exercise to better understand that characters’ environment.For example, if your character is a werewolf, try to use sense memory to explore each different sensory experience from the perspective of a werewolf.

, Use your own emotional memories during your performances to deliver more realistic responses and reactions. It can seem contradictory to use your own memories when trying to stay in character, but the goal of this exercise and tool is to use your own memories while you are in character. The more you use your own emotional memories in sense memory exercises the easier it will be to conjure these emotions up during performances.Try to create relationships between memories and emotions. For example, if your character needs to express anxiety over being fired, try to use the same memory each time to conjure that anxiety.

, Embodying your character while they are moving around set, doing gestures, or using mannerisms while speaking will give your character a comprehensive realism. Embodying your character will help even the most minor and peripheral movements and postures reflect the realist emotion and performance possible.


Embodying your character is what most people refer to as “getting into character,” which does ultimately happen before the performance begins. Try to give yourself a large margin between when you get into character and when you perform, like one hour.

, Remember to practice your relaxation exercises before any exercises or performances. Relaxation is fundamental to method acting and these emotional states cannot be realized without relaxation. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to relax before exercises or performances, like 1-2 hours."

Be a Tourist!",How to See a Broadway Show," Check the reviews in the New York Times or New York magazine theater section. Often a person will choose a play because a certain actor is performing, however the actor may be doing something out of his or her ordinary genre. Uninformed theater goers were disappointed to find Nathan Lane in the slow drama Butley some years ago.


Actors change often. Make sure the actor you want to see will still be appearing on the date you plan to attend. Check the play’s website to be sure.
Consider off Broadway and smaller productions. Wouldn’t it have been fun to see Rent or In the Heights in a small theater downtown? Also some of your favorite actors are performing on Broadway for theater production groups like the Manhattan Theater Club (David Hyde Pierce), The Roundabout Theater (Martin Short ) or The Labyrinth (Philip Seymour Hoffman). These productions companies are not for profit and have small budgets so they often depend on word of mouth for advertising.;
, Check websites like Playbill.com or TDF.org for discounts. The more popular plays like Wicked or Jersey Boys don’t need to offer discounts since they are generally sold out well in advance.


If you are in NYC and want to purchase for a same day performance check the TKTS discount booth locations for tickets. The Times Square location is always the most crowded. The South Street Seaport location is less so. The third location in Downtown Brooklyn is the least crowded. More information on the TKTS booths can be found at tdf.org.
Always check sites like StubHub.com for tickets. NEVER BUY FROM A TICKET SCALPER ON THE STREET. These tickets are always counterfeit. Scalpers prey on tourists desperate to see the hottest shows.
If you don’t mind paying full price, go directly to the theater. Being polite to the theater’s box office personnel goes a long way. Be flexible and don’t be too demanding. Often “house seat” tickets are put on sale a few hours before a show. “House seats” are tickets set aside for the actors or producers of the show and are almost always the best seats in the theater. If they go unused they are sold to the general public the day of the show and are rarely discounted.
Going solo is often your best chance for last minute tickets. Also January and February offer the best discounts. Snowstorms and holiday weekends are also a great time for hard to get last minute tickets.

, This is a matter of personal preference. Choosing a seat at the theater is akin to choosing one at a movie. Some people insist on sitting in the middle of a row for a good view. Others, given the cramped seating of Broadway theaters, insist on aisle seats for legroom.And just like seeing a movie, being in the first few orchestra rows are not necessarily the best seats in the house.


The first few rows of the balcony can be just as good as any in the orchestra. The back rows are sometimes less crowded and opportunities to stretch out are greater.

, If your play begins at 8pm make the reservation for 6:15pm at the latest. The theater district restaurants are well oiled machines when it comes to seating and serving theater goers. They can get you out in plenty of time. Still it doesn’t hurt to tell your server you have a curtain to make. Please avoid garlic and enjoying too much alcohol before the show.


Be aware that many restaurants in the theater district close early on Sundays. So be sure to eat before you attend a Sunday matinee.
Dress however you wish, but remember comfort. Jeans and a tee shirt are fine, so is a cocktail dress and a tuxedo. Be considerate of your fellow theater goers by showering and avoiding perfume.
In the winter months don’t wear a coat you can’t afford to get dirty. There isn’t a lot of room and chances are your overcoat will be on the floor beneath your chair.
When you enter the theater, ask if there is an intermission. Know the location of the restrooms and keep in mind that they tend to be very crowded during intermission. Don’t dilly dally when intermission begins, get to the candy counter or the restroom quickly.

, Don’t just silence it. Also your candy wrapper makes more noise than you think. Unwrap it before the performance begins. Avoid talking or singing along. The audience paid to hear Patti LuPone sing not you. Avoid clapping when your favorite actor comes on stage for the first time. It tends to break the rhythm of the play and the actor’s concentration.


If you have trouble hearing ask an usher for a headphone device to help. Having the person next to you repeat the actor’s lines over and over is annoying.

, Of course it is okay to wait by the stage door for autographs. Remember though that the actors are there six nights a week (and twice on Saturdays and Wednesdays). Their routine is often to leave the theater quickly to avoid, what else, the Broadway theater traffic.

They are pretty easy to find, either search the internet or pop into your local music store or book shop and ask for it, preferably also stating the composer(s) and, if possible, the ISBN number.;
, Ideally your Music Manager should have some experience with music and also be able to read music fluently.

, Make sure all members of your team have copies, and the rest are for the actors & actresses, band and other people working on the musical with you.

, One of the best ways to do this is to set up a panel, like X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, consisting of the Production Manager, someone who specializes in acting and someone involved with music. Audition for one part at a time! Call one hopeful in, get them to read some lines in that character and get them to sing one of their songs. See all hopefuls, and then decide who gets the part. Sometimes callbacks are necessary so if you can't decide between two hopefuls, call them back and maybe bring in an outside person for their opinion and perspective.

,), and people to make your props.

, Go to a company or teacher (if in school) and explain what you're doing. Then ask them if they would be interested in investing. If they say yes, ask (nicely!) how much they would be prepared to give or lend you. Offer them something in return, E.G 25% of the profits or Free tickets.

, Set clear goals and outline these to your cast and crew. Be very strict on deadlines.

, Don't just try to rehearse all of the musical in one go. Pick out sections, or songs and rehearse them. Eventually, put it all together, and then have a few dress rehearsals before your performance date. If cast don't turn up to rehearsals regularly, then either cut their lines, take them out of their part or kick them out completely. You cannot have people who are not committed or else it won't work. Same applies to your crew members.

, Maybe offer special deals if ticket sales are slow, like one child free with two paying adults. Also offer Student and Concession fees

, Hope it all goes well!

, This is a good way to pass time while waiting in line. (Do plan on having some wait time--this is a very popular method among avid theatregoers.) TKTS recommends having three shows in mind that you would like to see because ticket availability is limited.

, Discount percentages (even for the same show) may be different every day, so if you have a maximum ticket price in mind, TKTS staff can help you find a show that will fit your budget.

, TKTS sells Broadway tickets for same-day performances only, so between the time spent waiting in line for tickets and then seeing the show, this method will take up most of an afternoon or evening.

Bring your whole group.",How to See a Broadway Show on a Budget3," If you're in school and on a tight budget but can't afford to miss a show, student rush tickets are absolutely the way to go. These are discounted tickets that can be purchased at the box office on the day of the performance by showing a valid student ID. The first thing you need to do when planning to buy rush tickets is check the website for the show you want to see for the specifics of their student rush policy. (There are general guidelines, but every production and venue is different. Some shows sell general rush tickets that can be purchased without a student ID.)

, While some shows allow the purchase of rush tickets in advance online, for most shows you'll need to go to the box office. Depending on the popularity of a show, rush tickets sell out very, very quickly. The day's rush tickets go on sale as soon as the box office opens, so a popular show may have prospective rush ticket buyers lined up at dawn.

, In some cases, rush tickets can be purchased with a credit card, but many shows' rush tickets must be paid for in cash. Check the show's website before you get in line, but if payment method is unspecified, it is safe to assume that you'll need cash.

, Because a limited number of tickets are sold as rush tickets, there is virtually always a limit of one or two tickets per person, depending on the show.

Start by checking the website of the show you want to see for their ticketing policies.,
Find out when the show starts.,
Clear your schedule.,
Bring cash.",How to See a Broadway Show on a Budget4," Every show's lottery policy is different, and some shows don't do a lottery at all. The following are general guidelines.

, Curtain time for the day's performance(s) should be easily found on the show's website. This is important because lottery entry and drawing times are typically given in relationship to curtain time.

, Ticket lotteries typically begin two to two-and-a-half hours prior to curtain. Drawings for the lottery can fall anywhere between one and two hours prior to curtain. You don't need to stand outside the theater for this whole period, but your tickets will be forfeited if you're absent when your name is called. You'll want to be able to stay within a few blocks of the theater from the time you enter until the drawing is over.

, Like rush tickets, some lottery tickets can be paid for with a credit card, but if the show's website doesn't specify, assume that you'll need cash.

Check the website for the show you want to see.,
Do a little calculating.,
Stop by the box office early.",How to See a Broadway Show on a Budget5," You'll need to find out the specifics of their SRO policy. (Some shows don't sell standing room tickets at all.) The following are general steps for buying SRO tickets.

, Relax! It's easy, and it involves no math, that's a promise. Go to broadway.com and scroll down to the ""Popular Show"" list on their homepage. If the show you want to see isn't in (or very close to) the top 15 on this list, don't bet on getting SRO tickets. These tickets are only available for performances that are already sold out, and any show that isn't very, very popular is unlikely to do so. If the show you want to see isn't high up on the list, try one of the other methods first. If you're told that no tickets are left, you've then got the opportunity to ask about SRO.

, Some shows don't begin selling SRO tickets until very close to curtain time, but you'll still want to ask early in the day how close the show is to selling out. Box office staff will be able to tell you the likelihood of SRO tickets going on sale that day based on how many seats remain to be filled. If you're told that the show is unlikely to sell out, ask about rush or lottery tickets or try for SRO tickets to another show.

Reimburse your staff and investors.",How to Produce a Play," You, the producer, are the very first person to start the process of creating a play. Before anything else can happen, you (and/or your staff) need to decide which play to produce. You may decide to put on a theatrical classic, like Les Miserables, Death of a Salesman, Ms. Saigon, or A Raisin in the Sun - well-known plays like these frequently receive stage productions decades after their debuts. However, you may also decide to debut a new play. If this is the case, you should make a point to seek out quality scripts from talented writers, who may be found in a variety of places, including college campuses, theater companies, or via an agent or publisher.


Note that plays are intellectual property and, as such, will often require royalty fees for their use. Be sure to contact the playwright, his or her agent, or the rights owner if the script you've chosen isn't public domain.;
, The director is the ""boss"" of the play as far as creative decisions are concerned. S/he directs the actors as they rehearse, has the final say on aesthetic decisions like prop and set design, and, ultimately, will receive much of the glory (or derision) that the play garners upon its reception. The producer is responsible for finding a director who will be a good fit for the play - this can be a friend or professional partner or a promising newcomer. Keep in mind, however, that the director can always decline the invitation to direct or attempt to negotiate for a higher fee. As a producer, it is your job to find replacement directors and/or participate in negotiations as necessary.


Some producers take on the role of director as well. This puts an enormous amount of responsibility on one person's shoulders, so be cautious about tackling this double-role unless you have plenty of experience.

, One of the producer's most important functions is to pay for the play. If you are wealthy enough to pay for the play on your own, you may choose to be its sole financial backer. However, many plays are financed by a group of investors - wealthy individuals hoping to claim a slice of the play's profits. In this case, it's your job as the producer to ""pitch"" the play to investors, whether they're personal friends or rich strangers, in an attempt to get them to agree to pay for the play.


It's also your job to keep these investors happy and up-to-speed throughout the production, notifying them of production changes, new sales projections, and the like.

, Plays need a physical space for rehearsal and performance purposes. As the producer, it's your job to secure this space for your production. The venue should accommodate the technical aspects of your production (in terms of stage size, lights, sound systems, etc.) and should be large enough to fit your projected audience. Other aspects you may want to consider are:


The cost of using the venue - different venues will have different profit-sharing rules for ticket sales and so on
Whether or not the venue provides its own front of house staff (ticket takers, etc.)
Whether or not the venue provides liability insurance
The aesthetic and acoustic qualities of the venue
The history of the venue

, Every play needs a cast - even one-man shows do. If you're well-connected, you may have certain actors in mind for certain parts in your production, in which case you can contact them directly to offer them parts. If not, you should schedule auditions. Be sure to promote these auditions so that prospective actors will know where and when to be for a shot at a role in your production.


Focus your promotion efforts on places where actors are likely to be, like theater companies, art schools, etc. and groups they're likely to be in contact with, like talent agencies.

, Actors are far from the only people who work on a play. Stagehands, light and sound technicians, costume designers, choreographers, and countless more support staff collaborate to make a successful production. As a producer, you'll need to oversee the hiring of the support staff, though you won't necessarily direct them in their day-to-day duties, as this is usually delegated to various managers.


Note that, while many venues provide their own front of house staff, some don't, and, in these cases, you'll need to hire your own in addition to the other crew members.

, Generally, the director has the final say when it comes to casting, as s/he is the person who will ultimately work with the actors to create the finished product. However, depending on your relationship with the director, you may still have some input on the casting process,especially if you have previously worked on the creative aspects of theatrical production.

, Plays require extensive preparation and rehearsal to be ready to perform in front of a live audience. Collaborate with the director to create a rigorous but reasonable schedule that gradually increases in intensity as the opening night approaches. Keep in mind the price and availability of practice space and the dates of other events at the venue you've chosen. Some theater resources recommend scheduling at least one hour of rehearsal time for every page in the script.Be sure to reserve time at the end of your rehearsal schedule for technical rehearsals and at least one dress rehearsal. Technical rehearsals give the actors, director, and crew a chance to run through the play and work out any kinks in the technical aspects of the production - lights, sound cues, costumes, and special effects. Dress rehearsals consist of performing the play in its entirety as if an audience was watching with no breaks or stops. For instance, if an actor forgets his or her lines, the play must continue, as it would during an actual performance.

, Some venues will handle liability insurance for their theatrical productions, while others do not. In the event that an actor or audience member is injured during the play, theatrical liability insurance packages cover the cost, protecting you or the venue from paying out of pocket. Thus, liability insurance is a wise idea for many productions, especially ones involving high-flying acrobatics, pyrotechnics, and the like.

, Specially-designed props, sets, and costumes can take lots of time to produce. The construction of especially-complicated set pieces, for instance, may even need to begin before the actors start rehearsing! As the producer, you'll need to hire, coordinate, and delegate designers and technicians to bring your play to life.


If your production is strapped for cash, you don't necessarily have to create every physical aspect of your play from scratch. You might, for instance, organize a drive for old, out-of-fashion clothing as a source for costumes. You might also petition for volunteers in the local community to help you build your sets. Theater can be a great opportunity to bring your community together towards one fun, entertaining purpose.

, Usually, theatrical productions aren't just performed once. Large productions at major theaters can play several days a week for months at a time, but even smaller productions usually have a theatrical ""run"" consisting of multiple performances. As the producer, you'll need to decide on a schedule of performances that takes into account holidays, your staff's commitments, and market forces like seasonal theater attendance and so on.


Try to run your play for as long as you believe you'll be able to sell enough tickets to make a profit - if your play sells out, you can always add extra shows.

, Promotion is an essential part of the producer's job and perhaps the most important factor in determining whether your venue is packed on opening night. You'll want to get the word out about your play with every method that's within the limitations of your budget. You might, for instance, buy ad time on the radio or television, rent out a billboard, or distribute flyers at local universities. Depending on how ""big"" you're willing to go with your promotion efforts, the amount of money you spend on your production's advertising budget can range from insignificant to enormous.


Not all of your options for promotion cost money. If you can attract a newspaper or local news channel to your production to do a story, for example, you'll get publicity for free. Also, the internet offers plenty of zero-cost options for promotion, as social media and email are completely free.

, Your duties as a producer don't end after opening night. Though little, if any, preparation or planning should remain, you still remain the person who's primarily responsible for nearly every aspect of the play's production. Be ready to solve problems as they arise. You may need to arrange for failing props to be repaired or replaced, eliminate schedule conflicts by rescheduling shows, and the like. It's in your interest for your play to have a smooth, problem-free run, so don't shift to an inactive role after your play's debut.


As noted above, one thing you'll almost certainly be required to do is to keep your investors up to speed on the status of the play - particularly with regard to its financial success. You may be expected to present financial reports to these investors, which can be a stressful experience if the play isn't making money.

, When your play has (hopefully) begun to turn a profit through ticket sales, you'll need to start paying any financial investors back a percentage of the money you make. Often, the venue will demand a substantial chunk of ticket sales as well - as producer, you'll need to handle distributing the money that you make so that it finds its way to the right hands. Whether or not your play turns a profit, you'll also need to make sure that your hard working actors and production staff are paid what they are owed.

What's the skill, ability, or talent that will take you to the top? Think about what things come easiest to you, and listen to other people for advice to find your star-making quality.


Are you a gifted athlete? When you and your friends get together to play sports, are you always the first picked, or the one to score the most points? If so, you might have the makings of a sports star.
Do you love music? Do you enjoy singing, playing an instrument, or dancing to music, you might have the makings of a pop star, a singer, or a rock star.
Do you have the gift of gab? Are you a convincing and organizing presence, a leader among your friends? Does everyone listen to what you have to say? If so, you might have the makings of a politician.
Do love to pretend? Do you enjoy movies, plays, and television? Do people ever tell you you have a dramatic presence? If you're a good actor or actress, movie stardom might be in the cards.;
, Developing your talents into a star-level degree of skill will require help. Whether you want to go pro in acting or sports, politics or music, you've got to get insider info and learn to hone your skills from an expert in the field. Start taking acting or music lessons. Get private coaching for the sport you play. Secure an internship with a local politician, or volunteer for the campaign. Learn everything you can from people who know more than you.Find role-models as well in your field. If you want to be an actor, which actors do you look up to? Who would you like to emulate? Find someone to model your career after.

, Whether you do it under the guidance of a coach or go it alone, honing your craft is going to take lots and lots of work. For stars, studying the craft should be a 24/7 occupation. Even if you're flipping burgers, you should be rehearsing your lines. Even if you're just taking the bus to school, you should be going over your practice routines.


Absorb all the media that you can. Watch classic movies or listen to the type of music you hope to make., Develop a regular practice schedule and devote as much of your free time as possible to improving your talents in your star-making venture. Budding politicians need to practice speeches and public speaking. Musicians need to practice scales. Actors need to rehearse lines and study scenes. Pop stars need to work on their dance moves. Athletes need to train.


Be careful to focus on the proper things. For an actor, it can be tempting to get caught up in superficial things. Updating your social networking, checking TMZ, and other gossip rags isn't ""practicing"" for being a star. It's wasting time. Study your craft, not the other stuff., The first and in many ways the most challenging aspect of being a star is to get noticed. Make the initial contacts with the people who matter in your industry by starting out on the bottom. Just get your foot in the door and have the confidence that your talent will carry you the rest of the way.


Want to crack into making movies and get your name in lights? Get a job working as a gaffer. Seat-filling, extra-work, and tech-crew stuff is all a common part of Hollywood. You may want to act, eventually, but if you could put your skills to work as a make-up artist, as a back-up camera man, as a lighting crew member, you'll be that much closer, and you'll be working.
Politicians generally start out working for other campaigns. Volunteer your time for politicians you believe in and make contacts that will help you in your political career.
Athletes should work in coaching, or work in stadiums fulfilling other jobs. Work as an usher to get in to the games for free, or work the concessions. Tear tickets at Yankee stadium and you may be on the infield someday.
Musicians would do well to work for and with other bands. Learn to run live sound and help out at a venue, or get a job selling merch for a band you like. Be a roadie and learn what life on tour is like. Stay close to the action.

, As you work your way into the industry, make sure to stay in touch with everyone you meet on the way up. Try to meet people who are in the same boat as you, aspiring musicians, actors, politicians, or other athletes, who are at the same level as you are and who have similar goals. Help support each other and celebrate your friends' successes and accomplishments. Work together on your mutual goals.


Stardom can get pretty competitive, and it's true that there's not a whole lot of room at the top. But getting locked into petty rivalries can bring you down a lot quicker than it can lift you up. Be positive.
Make yourself easy to get in touch with. Start a LinkedIn page, or a professional social networking ""fan"" page for yourself so you can keep your industry contacts and your personal contacts separated and more manageable.

, A job stumping for a politician you don't particularly like in Des Moines? A third-string job on a team that's the worst in the league? An ad for hemorrhoid cream? These might not sound like ideal situations for a budding star, but work is work. Think of it as building experiences that'll make for a great rags-to-riches story somewhere down the road.


Use each opportunity as a chance to prove yourself and to transcend the circumstances with your star-making abilities. Be the star you are.

, Amateurs show up to an audition half-prepared, hungover, barely getting it together; movie stars show up well-rested, rehearsed, and ready to get the scene done. Rock stars don't party the night before the show, rock stars make sure they'll be on point for a great performance. Go into every job with professionalism and poise. Behave as if you belong there. Act like a professional, and you'll act like a star.

, Making all the contacts you need to in the industry can be very difficult to do alone. In most entertainment fields and in politics as well, you'll need to get in touch with an agent who can help to represent you and set you up with auditions, contacts, and jobs while you focus on the more important work of being the best you can be.


Usually, agents will take a percentage of what you make, but sometimes not at first. You may have to be willing to make periodic installments to pay your agent to get you work at first. Be judicious in picking an agent who'll work with you and get you the contacts and the work that you need.

, Whether or not you believe in fate, it's true that a star needs to learn to recognize the breaks when they come and embrace every opportunity as a chance to increase their star power. Check your ego at the door every now and then and give yourself the chance to succeed. A single opportunity may be the difference between regular work and full-on stardom.


A small, one-line part in a movie with a well-respected director may seem like a pittance, but it means you're working with the best. That's an opportunity.
An opening gig for a big band might seem like a step down if you've been touring on your own, but the chance to open for a hero? That comes along once in a lifetime.

, Once you've climbed and scrabbled your way to the top, it's important to stay busy. Celebrities come and go, grabbing their 15 minutes of fame and disappearing just as quickly. But real stars can learn to negotiate their careers to string it into a lifetime of challenging, engaging, and exciting work that people will enjoy watching and living vicariously through for years to come.


If you’re an actor, take on diverse roles and do things that will challenge your fans’ conception of you as a performer. Think of Sean Penn in Milk, Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot, and Charlize Theron in Monster.
If you’re a musician or another kind of performer, challenge yourself to keep the consistency of your music high. Take time on your recordings and on your performances. Don't go for the cheap and commercial buck.
If you're a politician, diversify your interests and be willing to change with the times. Embrace causes that will have you on the right side of history, rather than chasing votes with minute-by-minute opinion poles. Have integrity.
If you're an athlete, stay focused on keeping in shape and keeping your game at the highest possible level. Don't get distracted by clubbing, updating your social networking, or doing things that happen off the field. Be the best.

, Stardom can be a heavy crown to bear and even strong and talented people can fold under the spotlight. Learning to negotiate stardom is a challenge that you should seek head-on and come to terms with as quickly as possible. Learn to share your time in exchange for your celebrity.


Learn the name of the reporters you work with on a regular basis and talk to them as you'd talk to anyone. Don't get a big head about the ""little"" people. If you're followed by paparazzi, give them five minutes of time in exchange for some privacy later on in the night. Throw the dogs a bone.
Public flame-outs, like those which Charlie Sheen, John Edwards, and Chad ""Ocho-Cinco"" Johnson have suffered, are difficult to bounce back from. Learn to recognize when you might need a break to avoid destroying your career.

, Bright lights CAN melt stars. Let yourself rest up, relax, and spend time away from the center of attention so you can come back to your career as a star rested and prepared to do the work that got you there.


If you've been making blockbusters, go somewhere and do a small play that you believe in. Dedicate everything you've got to the intricacies and the art. Record your next album remotely in a far-away studio instead of downtown L.A.

, Stardom means fast-living, staying always on the move, sleeping little, and running yourself ragged. It can be very difficult for some people to eat right, avoid drugs and alcohol, and maintain a healthy relationship with sleep. Schedule regular doctor visits and consult a nutritionist to make sure that you're getting enough vitamins and nutrients in your busy life, and that you're being the most healthy version of yourself.

Learn to speak without moving your lips.,
Change your voice.,
Bring your new friend to life.,
Try to find a dummy that will fit that character.,
Convince yourself that your partner is completely alive.,
Animate your partner properly.,
Have fun with it.",How to Be a Good Ventriloquist," Hold a finger over your mouth as if trying to tell someone to be quiet. This will help prevent your lips from moving. Gritting your teeth together may help. Then, go through the alphabet. You'll notice that the letters ""b,"" ""f,"" ""m,"" ""p,"" ""q,"" ""v,"" and ""w"" will make your lips move. To say these without moving your lips, you must use substitutions. For ""b,"" say ""d"" or ""geh."" For ""f,"" say ""th."" For ""m,"" say ""n,"" ""nah,"" or ""neh."" For ""p,"" say ""kl"" or ""t."" For ""q,"" say ""koo."" For ""v,"" say ""th."" And for ""w,"" say ""ooh"". You may think the new words with the substituted letters sound ridiculous, but if you learn to put the stress on the syllables that don't contain these letters, the words will begin to sound natural.;
, A convincing ""vent"" voice must be very different from yours. Try to listen to yourself speak. Do you speak loudly or softly? Fast or slow? Do you have a low voice or a high voice? Try to make your partner's voice different from yours in all or most of these categories. To change your voice, you must use different functions in you body. For example, notice that when you speak and pinch your nose, your voice changes.


One excellent way to help change your voice is to force air through your nose instead of your mouth when you speak.
Another good way is to force the sound from deeper inside your throat, and also force the sound from the diaphragm. To force the sound, pretend you are about to cough. You can also pretend to be lifting something heavy. You'll notice that the muscles around your stomach will tighten. Now, using those muscles, try to speak. This will result in a deeper, raspier voice, which can also be handy, depending on what type of personality you want your partner to have.
Choose your ""vent"" voice carefully depending on what type of partner you want. If he or she is smart and witty, have him or her speak quickly, without stuttering. If he or she is unintelligent or slow, have him or her speak in a low, slow voice. The voice you choose helps to amplify your partner's personality and helps bring him or her to life.

, Decide what kind of partner you want. You must always make sure that his or her personality is different from your own, to give the illusion that you are not the same person. If you are a kind, responsible person, make your partner a mischievous jokester. Just choose something that will contrast your personality.

, For example, if your imagined character is a young, energetic boy, don't pick a dummy that's an old man or a young lady. Make sure to pick the right partner for your needs.

, Once you've done this, it will be easier to convince an audience. Try to make sure that, from the moment you pick him or her up (take him or her out of his case, bed, etc.) and grab the controls, he or she is totally alive. Have him or her tell you stories about what he or she has been up to, where he or she goes to school, etc. Even though you are technically making this up, it will help you believe that there is life in your partner.

, There are many different control schemes for dummies, but a good, average one that is excellent for beginners and even for advanced vents is one with a moving head. Be careful while purchasing your dummy that you don't buy one with a string on the neck to operate the mouth. Buy one where you put your hand in the back, grab a stick attached to the head, and push a trigger to move the mouth. This is key when animating your partner. When your partner speaks, make sure his or her mouth moves with every syllable that he or she speaks. Also, keep your partner moving, even when you are speaking. This will make the audience think that he or she is real. Also, be sure to remember the amount that he or she is moving. If he or she is young and energetic, have his or her head move quickly and shake while he or she is speaking. If he or she is an older person or a sleepy child, have his or her head move slowly and not very much. Be sure that the head isn't moving too much while he or she speaks, or this will distract the audience from the actual speech. Try to observe real people as they speak, and have your partner mimic those movements.

, A big factor in being a good ventriloquist is having passion. You must always practice the art. Practicing every day will eventually make you a fantastic ventriloquist. You also don't have to practice only by sitting and speaking with your partner. Play games with your partner, watch TV with him or her, bring him or her to family get-togethers and have others meet him or her. Whether you are taking up ventriloquism for fun or for a career, make sure you are having fun with it. The illusion of life doesn't come easily, but you just have to believe in your friend to make him or her come alive. Don't treat him or her like a rock. Treat them like they are you brother or sister!

Don't worry about getting any more famous.",How to Be a Superstar Without Being World Wide," You may be surprised to learn that this isn't just what everyone thinks it is, such as singing, dancing or acting. You might be brilliant at math, superb at oration or terrific at drawing. Whatever your talent, taking it to superstar status requires finding what you're best at, then working it.;
, Improve it by learning supporting skills, practicing or studying or doing whatever it takes to really hone your talent and ensure that you're the best at it by a long shot.

, There is no point aiming to be the best at something to garner attention, only to hate what you have become or what you're doing. Be absolutely sure this is what you want.

, Enter competitions, shows, contests, auditions, whatever is relevant. If it's acting, try auditions, if it's math, enter math competitions. And do your level best to win. And even if you don't do your level best to be interesting so that the media notices you.

, Do covers, talks, dances, art shows, videos, websites, etc. to show off your talent in its best possible light.


If you need help with design, get someone good to do the work for you. Good work will show you in your best way and will earn support from readers and viewers, your potential fans.







, Start following people and have them follow back. Leave updates that are half telling people what you're doing and half helping people with news, information, ideas and advice in response to questions. Don't bore people to tears with self-absorption; aim high from the start, aim beyond yourself.


Interact! Answer those comments (the pleasant, well constructed ones at least). Say hi back to people and ask how they are doing too.

, Send letters to the makers of the shows letting them know what you're doing and why. Weave them a whole story, and a good, strong and positive one at that.


Be truthful in explaining your talent. Pretending you can do things that you can't will be just plain embarrassing and could harm your reputation.







, Be personable, approachable and willing to engage in casual banter. Communicating is a large part of becoming a superstar. If people feel that they can relate to you and you're easy to talk to, that's half the battle won.

, Notice and listen to what people like and give them way more of it!

, Whether you're communicating science, math and technology, or dancing, singing and tap-dancing your way to fame, present yourself well so that people are impressed and see in you someone they'd like to emulate. Be resourceful, be relevant and be original in the clothing you wear, the appearance you adopt and the fashion statements you put forth.

, Don't rest on your laurels and don't get stuck in a rut. Keep learning, keep reinventing and keep up-to-date (or ahead of it all). Lifelong learning counts, no matter what your superstar status.

, There will be plenty, there always have been, there always will be. Without such people, there would be less chance to be at the top showing what you've really got because everyone would be too busy being their best. Realize that some people will be unkind, mostly because they can be. Learn to respect only comments that come from people you respect, and this does not include anonymous commenters or people with clear trolling or lopping tendencies. Have inward pity for these people but show no outward reaction; protect yourself and move on, focusing on the people who get what you're doing and really appreciate your talent and uniqueness.


Realize that as you age, perceptions of you will differ too. This can be good and bad, depending on how you play to it. The best approach is to direct the perception and help others in your same age group benefit from you as a spokesperson for your era.







, When you gain sufficient status to be recognized, use this to benefit your fans and followers. Consider what you can give back to them. Perhaps it is about giving a concert in your local town hall, perhaps it's about giving a speech supporting people who are doing it tough in some way, or perhaps it is by donating your time, money or skills to a cause you really care about.

, It is enough that you're recognized and fêted in your own area or country. If your fans spread word of you worldwide, that's just an added bonus, not a necessity."

Sign up for theatre classes in your school if you can. Audition for school plays. High school drama programs are a great way for you to get a feel for what the acting world is like and start building your experience and skill as an actor.If you're in college, you can likely find a student-run theatre program that has open auditions. Take advantage of any opportunities to act you can find at your school. Search your schools list of clubs and organizations. Contact the ones that put on plays and ask them how to get involved.;
, Although there are plenty of movie stars who didn't go to college, or did go to college but not for theatre, it certainly can't hurt. Especially if you're coming out of high school with no theatre experience, getting acting skills and experience in college is a worthwhile step. Research colleges and their drama programs.Things to consider when choosing a school include:


How well rated is their drama program? What kind of classes do they offer? How many of their alumni are professional actors? Do they have an agent showcase? How well does the schools and it's drama program fit with my goals as an actor?

, If you're not in high school or college, you should still be getting acting training. Most movie stars have spent many years honing their acting chops. Any opportunity to do so will improve your chances. Search online for acting classes and workshops near you., Whether you're in high school, college, or neither, you can get acting experience in your current town by volunteering for local theater productions. Audition for upcoming productions. Contact local theatre companies and ask what kind of volunteer work they have available. Even if it's not acting work, working at a theatre company will give you an ""in"" for when they start casting for later productions.Alternatively, look for community television stations near you. Contact them and ask about volunteering opportunities.
Once you start volunteering, learn as much as you can. Observe how things work in the company. Ask questions. Get to know the people involved. This is the time to start build a relationship with the industry and those inside it.

, You don't have to be in a movie or play to work on your acting skills. There are ways to improve your acting on your own as well. Make short films with your friends. If you have friends who are also interested in some aspect of acting or movie making, this is an option for building experience that requires no prerequisite or luck.Even if you're alone in your pursuit of acting skill, there are ways to practice on your own. Practice monologues in front of a camera. Practice playing different types of characters and personalities. Review the recordings you made and look for areas of improvement. Rinse and repeat.

, Extras are the people in movies with no speaking lines, the background people. Search for movie projects that are being filmed in and around your area. Look for calls for extras. These jobs will often be unpaid, and you won't get any quality acting experience, but it's something to put on your acting resume, so don't discount it.The simplest way to find extra work is to search online for upcoming films being shot in your area. Then contact the casting agency for the film and ask about extra opportunities. Volunteer to be an extra for free.

, Depending on the area you live in, there might be opportunities to be in films near you. Search online for open casting calls in your area. Look for both feature length films and short films. If you find an open casting call, go to the audition. Dress your best, prepare your audition material in advance, and give it your all. And most importantly, don't be discouraged by rejection. Taking rejection well is an essential skill for aspiring movie stars.Even if there's no professional acting opportunities near you, there's always student films. If you're anywhere near a college with a film-making program, there will be no shortage of film students looking for amateur acting talent.

, Depending on the area you in, there might simply be a lack of real acting opportunity near you. If you're really serious about becoming a movie star, you're going to have to move to Los Angeles eventually. This is where the majority of big-budget movies are made. It's where the acting agents are, and it's where big breaks happen., Plenty of famous actors started out with non-acting jobs and moved their way up. This is a common strategy for any profession. Start by looking for volunteer and interning opportunities in production companies. Are they looking for someone to coordinate the catering? Someone to help with the equipment? You can find out by searching for these opportunities online, or calling companies and asking about volunteering.Research what film production companies are in your area. Then go to their websites and look for contact information, or information about volunteer opportunities.

, You need a good resume and a quality headshot. It's the first thing that agencies and casting directors will see and can make or break your chances at getting auditions.A quality headshot must be 8x10 inches, and done by a professional photographer, preferably one with a good reputation who specializes in headshots.
A quality resume will include all of your acting experience, with details about the productions and your role. It will include vital statistics like your height, eye and hair color, and vocal range. It will include any sort of special skills you posses, and your contact information.

, For most television and movie acting roles, the only way to get an audition is through an agent. That makes getting an agent a vital step on the road to movie stardom. There are two main ways to get an agent:Be noticed by an agent. Do all the acting you can, student films, community television, local theatre. Film schools often invite agents to their showcases as well. If an agent sees you and likes you, you're in luck.
Send a well polished resume to agencies. Look up agencies that are accepting unsolicited submissions. Then make sure you have a professional and complete resume that includes a cover letter, and send it.

, Being a part of a union like the Screen Actors Guild opens up a lot opportunities for bigger and better roles. You can act professionally without joining a union, but there will be a limit to how high you can rise in most cases.The Screen Actors Guild is the biggest union, but also the hardest to join. One way is to work as a background actor in a SAG production. Another way is to first be a part of an affiliated union like ACTRA, AEA, AGMA or AGVA. Also keep in mind that after joining the union, you can't work on non-SAG productions. So you trade the freedom to work on non-contract jobs with the ability to pursue bigger roles with higher guaranteed salaries.

, As an aspiring movie star, auditioning is your job. Take as many auditions as you can, and don't discouraged by lack of success. It'll will take nothing more or less than great patience and persistence to move through the acting ranks., Finding positive role models and mentors is an essential skill to learn if you want to go far in the movie industry. Get used to talking to anyone and everyone involved with the production of whatever you're working on. Make friends and ask questions. Increasing the size of your professional network will lead to more opportunities down the line., It may not be what you want to hear, but often times, what separates quality actors who make it big from those that don't is nothing more than being in the right place at the right time. A director happens to like something in your audition, and the production goes well, and the movie hits it big, and suddenly you're on your way to stardom. All of the previous steps will increases your chances, but one of the biggest keys to success is just patiently waiting for good opportunities, and taking them when they appear."

Practice the bowing at the end the performance with your actors.,
When a performance is over, congratulate everyone on a job well done.,
Pass on constructive feedback.,
Start something new.",How to Be a Good Director," As a director, you try to find a play that is best suited to convey what you want to say to the audience. It is important that the play reflects how you feel about certain issues, either social, moral or ethical, and that the audience understands what you are trying to say. Once you've found a play or have written one yourself, it is time to gather a cast.;
, You are now at the point where you have to choose who will be on your cast. This can be a difficult choice, either because you have too few good actors or too many. In case of the former, you will have to spend a lot of rehearsal time improving their acting; in case of the latter, you simply have a luxury problem with the downside that some of the actors may sulk a bit because they wanted a bigger part and could have handled one well. At moments like that, it would be a good idea to remind those who are sulking that they are good actors but that your word is final. This is a direct mode of address and can be considered as rather rude, but when carried off gracefully you can earn the respect of your actors by being honest.


When you hold auditions, be sure to keep a weather eye open for chemistry between certain actors. You can benefit from casting them in roles that require them to be on stage together a lot both physically and verbally.

, Once you finally start rehearsing, it is important to first explain your rules and how you work to your cast. Some of them may have only had one director prior to working with you and are used to a certain modus operandi. Be clear from the start that you have a certain method by which you work and that there are certain rules. Preferably, those rules are simple. For example: the actors are not allowed to speak during concentration exercises. Though this may seem obvious, it may sometimes happen that you have an excitable group to work with. For such a group, keeping a tight ship could be beneficial. It also shows that you take your part in the production seriously, which gains you some extra respect.


If you are working with inexperienced actors, organising other activities such as a rehearsal camp or some evenings out together could be very beneficial to both you and the cast. You get to know them a little better and, engaging in pleasant conversation, they find out that you're not the Bogart they may have believed you were. It also allows your actors to get to know each other in an environment that doesn't involve them being focused.
Make sure your production manager is present at most, if not all, rehearsals. They need to know about the props you need in a timely fashion so they can arrange for them to be there when your production is ready to hit the theatres.
At the beginning of each rehearsal, have your actors do some concentration exercises. It will get them focused on the work that lies ahead of them. next to concentration exercises, vocal and physical exercises are also very useful as a warm-up.

, For example, before each scene, tell the actors what you want to see them do. This will prevent an endless quest through various different approaches while you are trying to figure out which one you prefer. Of course, this is a style of directing that may not suit everyone. A production can also greatly benefit from experimentation. In the end, it depends on the type of play you're working on and the actors you're working with as well as personal preference.


At the end of the scene, give general comments concerning blocking, missed lines or things proceeding too slow or too fast. Give each actor individual comments after they have done a scene, possibly concerning their body language or the way they interact with the other actors on stage. Once you've done that, give the actors who are not in the scene a chance to speak their minds. They are your extra eyes and ears and they may spot something you have missed.

, This can be between you and members of your cast, or cast members among themselves or production crew having issues with the way people are treating the props. You must make sure that you give everybody a big thumbs up and a pep-talk when they need it. This is when you truly show what you are made of. A good director will be supportive and professional even at times of great stress, and performance-nights are part of those times.


Remain calm and in control. It is okay to vent after the performances are over but definitely not before or during. Even if things go wrong during the dress-rehearsal, show the people around you that you have rock-solid faith in them. It will make them feel better and therefore work better. All will benefit from this.

, Especially if they are new to the stage, make sure that you establish an order of who goes on stage first and who follows who. Also make sure that the person in the middle thinks of a signal to start the bow, such as squeezing the hands of the two people who are standing next to him, who then pass this on so that everybody knows it is time to bow. It would be sad to end the play with a sloppy bow.


You will only join them in this ritual at the end of the final performance.

, This is especially important when it's the last performance. Compliment your actors, production crew and technicians on the good work they did. Either before or after you do this, talk to the audience to find out what they thought. After all, they are the people you are communicating with. They can provide you with insights that you had not thought of and that will enrich the next performance.

, When advice given to you from your audience is worthwhile, tell your actors about it. Particularly if your production has multiple performances, this is useful to both you and them. Make sure everyone arrives in a timely fashion before the next performance so that you can go over the various scenes with them and tell them what went well and what did not. A production is a learning process for all involved and no two performances are the same.


Audiences differ each night, and things that work well one night may not get the same feedback from the audience another night. This does not mean that they are bad things, it is merely a matter of audience dynamics: some audiences just prefer physical action while other prefer verbal sparring.

, Now that you are done with this production it is time to start thinking about the future. If you're lucky, you've found some time to network or someone who saw your play wishes to hire you for a project they are financing. If you're not lucky, the cycle starts all over again or you end up without a project. Make sure, therefore, that every production you direct is one you support fully. That way, there are no regrets and you can look back fondly on the work you did, no matter how small or amateur the production.

It’s about using every little prop, and body part, to your advantage. Is Burlesque for you? What is it? Where did it come from? If you have never heard of Lili St Cyr or Gypsy Rose Lee then you haven't learned enough! History of Burlesque is just as important as the technicalities.

Lovely ladies who you may want to look into are Burlesque artists: Lili St Cyr, Gypsy Rose Lee, Sally Rand, (and more recently) Dita Von Teese, Catherine D’lish, The Sweet Soul Burlesque Troupe from Vancouver… fetish and pinup model Bettie Page, movie icons Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Betty Grable, Barbera Stanwyck, Rita Hayworth, and Mae West for style and glamour inspiration.

Watch dance shows and films, get to grips with how to work those limbs.


If you can’t find any troupes or shows near you to join, you can start out in pole/strip clubs if they’d take a classier act. Remember that hands-on audiences are a no-no! Burlesque, is, of course, stripping (usually down to pasties and a g-string) but the tease part is the main bit! Remember dolls, Dita Von Teese started out in a strip joint!






If there’s no chance there, then local bars and clubs need shows and performances of entertaining value to draw in customers on the nighttime. A classy bit of Burlesque is great here also, though it does help if you can sing a little cabaret!






If you have trouble finding a troupe, don’t start there. More on troupes later! If you do join a troupe, you probably don’t need the rest of this guide! Listen to these lovely ladies and ask yourself if it’s the life you want. If not, search for another troupe, or go it solo.







,


In every Burlesque Beauty’s closet (in addition to their own signature props and costumes, of course!) should be: a sheer negligee, a pair of slippers or heels that have feathers or fluff on them somewhere, a pair of heels or stilettos in satin, patent, or covered in rhinestones or glitter, thigh high stockings in nude and black, suspender belts in the three base colours (red, black, and white)- or better - a corset or waspie with suspender snaps! You will also need, of course, matching underwear, and above all: pasties! Pasties and nipple tassels are a must if you intend on taking off so much! You should also have a feather fan to incorporate somewhere. Other musts are bold lipstick colours, black liquid eyeliner, and nail polish to match your lipsticks of course!






For hair and make-up: try cherry red lips, and black cat-flicked eyeliner. Look at vintage hairstyles for inspiration in the eras 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. Barrel-curled hair is easy, best done with nylon net rollers and pins! You can also use hot-rollers, they are great and quick before a show! Invest in lots and lots of hairspray. Be bold with colour. If you’re wearing a blue corset, wear blue nail varnish and blue lipstick, but line the edge of your lips in black and blend them together for twilight to midnight look. If you’re wearing lilac, wear lilac lipstick, smoking purple eyes, and matching polish. Oh, and don’t forget your toenails need love too!






Clothing: Be a vintage vixen. Curvy wiggle dresses, cocktail gowns, and all manners of retro clothing remind of a more glamorous era when ladies always wore a pair of stockings. Nothing better than to create the illusion of that in the minds of common males, eh? Pillbox hats are brilliant- or any hat with a veil actually. Mini top hats are gorgeous accessories and so are big hair flowers and fascinators.







, If you don’t join a troupe, it’s important that you practice the basics. Taking corsets off with one hand, dancing on your tip toes as though you’re wearing high heels, extending the arms and legs gracefully, and so on doesn’t come naturally to some people. Depending on what type of act you want to do, you will need to learn different things, but as a rule of thumb you need to be able to take your clothes off and look good doing it! The idea is that you don’t look like you’re concentrating. When you get dressed and undressed, always try to do it one-handedly, and also as though someone is watching you so you must keep all your intimate parts covered! Can you change your bra without taking off your blouse?


There are tons of props just waiting to be bought or made, and inspiration all around you! You might already have been inspired!






Signature routines: You must be bold! Dream up anything! So your show is budget. Economy versions are often best because they have been thought about! Flick through fancy dress costume catalogues for some great ideas, and traipse through charity stores to see if you’re inspired by a piece of jewellery, or a certain bodice or skirt. Don’t be a copycat darling! Originality is key. The Martini Glass (all credits to the gorgeous Ms. Von Teese) has been done, and so have the diaphanous bubbles! What do you like in your house? What do you like in your city? You can base a routine around anything!






Seductive tricks: On stage- learn to suspend yourself from a pole and slide down it v-legged. Learn how to take all your clothes off (besides those pasties and panties of course!) with only a fan in each hand as coverage and not show the pasties or panties! Learn how to sit on a chair provocatively. Chairs are great, cheap props, and everyone loves a chair routine! Learn to lock eyes with your audience. They won’t know what hit them. To tease whilst seated, stretch out your legs and rub them round as though feeling the seam up the back, or caressing the stockings. You can also disrobe with your back turned to your audience. Especially taking off that corset or bra… they won’t immediately know about your pasties!







, It may come as a shock, but you may find it hard to walk around in jeans and a tee-shirt. Why? Because it's not glamorous. Is Audrey Hepburn famous for wearing jeans? No! Did Marilyn Monroe’s tracksuit bottoms puff up with air? These are two lovely ladies who were known for class, style, sex appeal, and yet they weren’t Burlesque honeys - but they were still icons. You work, learn, and live the fluffy wedge slippers and chiffon nightgowns, but Burlesque is almost about everything we do. If you wear a bullet bra on stage, wear one off stage, and if you wear matching underpinnings on stage, wear them off stage. You’ll probably feel better about yourself too! Be a glamour girl every minute of every day if you want to be a real Burlesque ‘star’. It’s a lifestyle, and it doesn’t have to be expensive either!


Learn to look modest, to pout, to laugh, to adjust your stockings when you know people are looking but pretend to be trying to do it discreetly, be glamour and class personified. Apply lipstick in public in a powder compact, do wiggle when you walk, do wear heels, do act like a 50’s movie star and you’ll feel like one!







, Things are smooth, and you’re a glamour kitty, okay, but you want to be a star, right? You want to have the glitz, the real crystals instead of rhinestones, and be booked the world over for famous celebrity parties. You’re doing well at the bar/joint that you work, but you’re not earning wads of cash. So, of course, you need to build a brand for yourself. You need to create a demand, and then fulfill it. Hand out personal flyers and start getting bookings for parties. It may seem seedy, but there’s an art to being subtle and you’ve probably learned it already if you’ve come thus far without being dragged off down the ‘sleazy’ path. People book you, and people tell people. Build a website with your info, be available! Join an agency if you think it will help. Have hunger for it, and it will come. Organise your own show at a nice venue or hall, and make the tickets reasonable but to cover the cost- you can up the price later when there’s more demand. A new type of show will have plenty of support and you can advertise it in the local newspaper, on the radio, and on local news television if you can. Flyers, posters, anything as long as the image it conveys is something that will show people a classy and yet very artful and sexy type of performance. Above all, be original and be different, but not too strange or cult or people will be scared to see your show!

,, For example a feline-oriented act would present the name ""Ariella Von Kat"" or Kat Firelust"". Also, have a wardrobe consistent with your theme. You should also be able to sing, sword swallow, have some knowledge of theater or some other side act along with burlesque. You're going for artsy stuff here, NOT trashy!,, Once you join, it is imperative that you get along with the other dancers as much as possible. You will be kicked out if you cause discord, Also, you must always introduce yourself by your stage name for security reasons. Too much seduction, and some patrons might get the wrong idea., This guarantees they will come back. Who knows, you might become their favorite dancer!, Much like in show business, a dancer can only date within their own community i.e. dancers can date managers, master of ceremonies, choreographers and anyone else involved in the business.,, If you are likable, shows will be a breeze., Nobody likes a tyrant or hothead. You must all work together as a cohesive unit., You’re being booked up, sold out, and the next thing you know is you’re a local celebrity. Time to start planning shows in other cities and venues, no? Take it extreme. Create a troupe if you haven’t joined one. Local dancers might try it, local strippers might be looking for something to be more uptown. Create an interesting venture between yourself and your community, but don’t let any honeys upstage you, no no, you must be the most extravagant of them all. Plain Jane never got any attention after all!

Connect with your audience.","How to Develop a ""Radio Voice"""," Develop a powerful voice by practicing strength training for your voice. Choose words with specific sounds, and repeat them going up and down the octaves of your vocal range. Repeat them again at a louder volume.Try repeating, “Mm-mmm. Mmm-hmm.”
Try repeating, “Nay, nay, nay” ten times.
Try making a siren sound using vowels up and down your vocal range.
Broadcasters use their vocal cords quickly and with well-controlled tension.;
, Look in the mirror and practice saying each word slowly and properly. Don’t mumble.Practice saying tongue-twisters at a rapid pace. Improve your speech quality and it will be easier for you to enunciate live at a faster pace.Try repeating, “Betty Botter bought a bit of butter” six times.
Try repeating, “The ragged rascal ran around the ragged rocks” several times.

, Get to know the qualities of your voice. Evaluate how you handle mistakes and where you can make improvements. Make sure that you aren’t dwelling on your mistakes, which will just draw attention to them.For example, if you mispronounce a word, just correct it – if that’s necessary for the audience to understand what you meant – and keep going., Drink warm water or tea with a slice of lemon when you get up in the morning and throughout the day. Don’t drink a lot of sugar or caffeine, which can have a drying effect on your voice. Avoid milk and dairy products, which encourage mucus production.Warm drinks are best, rather than very hot or cold drinks.
Green apples contain pectin, which can combat phlegm. Try drinking green apple juice or eating a green apple.

, Relax your shoulders, but don’t stoop them or slouch. Keep your body erect but relaxed. Do posture exercises if it’s hard for you not to slouch.Good posture gives you the best use of your abdominal-diaphragmatic breathing.
Slouching pressures the rib cage which makes it harder for you to inhale.

, Open a window, if possible, to make the air you’re breathing fresher. Breathe deeply into your lungs without raising your shoulders. Take breath into your nose for the count of three, pause, and then exhale in one big breath for a count of eight., Maintain a humidity level of at least 30% in your work environment. Run a humidifier, if needed.Breathe in steam from a personal steamer (available at drugstores) or a hot shower. Alternately, pour boiling water into a sink basin and inhale the steam.Inhaling steam moistens your voice box and can relieve irritation of the vocal folds.
Don’t inhale steam from directly over a pot of boiling water or a stove.
Try wetting a washcloth in hot water, wringing it out, and breathing through it with your mouth and/or nose.

, Put the heels of your hands under your cheek bones. Rub the muscles of your face by pressing inwards and down. Let your jaw open itself as you massage your face.Do this a few times to warm up your mouth and lessen tension in your jaw.
You can also use circular motions to massage your facial muscles.

, To hum, exhale with a light “hmmmm” sound at a low octave that’s comfortable for you. Do this again, adding an “ahhh” sound for the second half of the exhale. To buzz your lips, purse them somewhat and vibrate your lips as you breathe out, with your tongue relaxed. Inhale, then trill with your lips again on the exhale.You can try these exercises at escalating and deescalating pitches.

, Hold your tongue behind your top teeth. Breath out, vibrating your tongue in the sound of an “r.” Maintain the sound. Do this at various pitches, without going past your comfort level.This exercise helps your tongue to relax, while stimulating your voice and breath.

, Stretch your voice by starting in a low octave and moving upwards using the sound of “me.” Don’t force your range. Instead, use gentleness to broaden your range with each repetition.Also try this exercise with the sounds “e” and “oo.”

, Maintain the organic tone of a conversation. Read written words in a relaxed manner to appeal to the listener. Avoid overly formal speech. Imagine that you are reading aloud to yourself or talking to someone one-on-one. Bring the words to life like you’re telling a story.Casey Kasem gave the advice to imagine your microphone is an elegant violin that you wish to play with as much feeling as you can.

, Express your ideas and statements strongly throughout. Don’t trail off, leaving an idea unfinished. Keep a consistent focus and volume.For instance, don’t use all of your air until it’s necessary for you to take a breath. Pause your sentence to quickly inhale, then continue speaking., Focus on sounding like you. Don’t try to pigeonhole yourself to satisfy a stereotype, such as by intentionally enhancing your dialect to match a region, age, race or religion. Be sincere and people will want to listen to you, more than if you presented them with a purposefully inauthentic version of you.You may have broadcasters you admire, but don’t try to sound like someone else. Your uniqueness is what can set you apart.
Use the voice you hear in your head when you’re reading a story to yourself.

, Research news and current topics of interest. Prepare talking points and notes. Talk about what you think your audience would want to discuss, more than what you want to talk about.You can find hot topics by looking online at trending information, and observing what listeners call and write in about.

Remember to thank the other cast and crew members, music coordinators, and your directors.",How to Prepare Yourself Before a Performance," Go over every aspect of the performance until you are satisfied. To improve your practice, ask directors for pointers; they are there to help you out. While no show is perfect, with persistence, you can create a very satisfying end result.;
, When you are in bed, picture yourself on the stage having a great time. Go through your lines, songs, and dance moves, and picture them going perfectly. Having anxiety about the performance will keep you awake, so the key is to stay relaxed and create a positive image of yourself on the stage.

, Eat plenty of eggs, bananas, spinach, and orange juice. It's also important not to drink alcohol before a performance so that you can focus on what you need to do.

, If your director has a certain dress code in mind, follow it. Because of the constant costume changes, wearing a black tank top and black shorts is efficient. Before wearing it onstage, practice at home. Pick out something in your closet similar to your costume, such as a dress. Practice slipping it on and off, and make sure that nothing snags or pulls. Make sure that whatever you wear backstage is appropriate for pictures, too. Most performers take pictures in their costumes, but sometimes you are required to change before coming out to meet the audience. You must be comfortable in quick change clothes, but still look presentable.

, Some directors and shows call for little makeup if you have small theatre, but it's likely you'll need stage makeup done, which is rather excessive. Your director will most likely tell you what your makeup is supposed to be, you may even have a makeup artist. If they don't tell you, ask. It is never okay to go onstage without any makeup because your face will melt into the lights.

, Be sure to hairspray and tease, if you need the extra volume.

,


If allowed, keep a water bottle backstage. Don't drink a lot because this can affect your dancing, but just a few sips so that you can sing and speak easily.






Never bring anything backstage that you're not allowed to have. You should never disobey the director.







, Each theatre group is different in the way they set up backstage.

If there are changing rooms in the back, take advantage of them. If not, remember that the entire cast are your friends and that it shouldn't be awkward changing in front of them. If you have a complicated costume -- for example, a dress with hard-to-reach buttons on the back or a zipper that always seems to disappear -- ask a friend to help you out.






When backstage, remember to be quiet. When the audience hears noise backstage, it ruins all of the hard work you put in to create an exceptional show, and is embarrassingly unprofessional.







, Right before you go on stage, gather up all of the cast members and form a circle. Face outward, join hands and picture yourself on the stage. One person should start by squeezing the hand of the person next to them, and the next person will pass it on, and it will keep on going until you've gone around the circle. After this has been done, let go of hands and get ready for the first scene.

, It will be dark where the audience is seated, and you won't be able to see their faces. When you aren't saying lines, take deep breaths. Just make sure the audience can't tell. Just have fun!

, You can make up a funny rhyme to help you remember. Another good idea is to have a friend who can cue you before the next scene, or if the lights die for scenery change, they can nudge you in the right direction.

, Be proud of your performance and display the emotion that your character is feeling. If you are performing an emotional scene, pull the audience into your tale so that it's an enjoyable experience. Keep in mind that you're not only representing who you are as performer, but also the rest of your cast and crew members and your directors as well! Remember to smile (if you are suppose to) and have lots of fun!

, Boring love scenes can be extremely disappointing for the audience. Don't be afraid to hold hands, put your arm around your partner, or even kiss. This is just a performance, it doesn't mean anything. If you feel awkward about something, talk to your partner about it. They'll understand and might even feel the same way. Talk about exactly what you want to do onstage, and what you don't want to do. That way, while it will be more comfortable and routine for you, the audience will love it!

, The curtain call is when the audience will be taking lots of pictures, so wear a big smile. Depending on the type of show, you might want to stay in character for a few extra seconds before you break out into a smile. Also, if you have one last song to sing at the end, belt it out loud and proud. This is when all of your hard work pays off.

, Be gracious, and thank them for taking the time to come and support you. If someone gives you flowers, smile, and be prepared for pictures. It's also polite to introduce your supporters to the other cast members. Never take anyone in the audience backstage or into the changing rooms unless they are allowed to. It's strange and unprofessional to reveal the way the special effects are done and where you keep the props.

, There is always room for improvement, and sometimes performing in front of an audience can help you see what you need to work on.

, They deserve credit for all of the hard work they did to help make the show a success. Remember that although they did mostly behind-the-scenes work, that this is in some ways the most important part and that the show wouldn't be possible without them. It might even be a good idea to bring them flowers!

Watch the show a few times to get a better understanding of player strategies.,
Once you're on the show, the actual actions you take are quite simple.,
Choose cases to open.,
Choose ""Deal"" or ""No Deal"" once each round ends.,
Keep in mind your money goal and never be too greedy.

",How to Win Deal or No Deal," Watch for the mistakes that some people make when they get caught up in the drama of the show.;
, First, choose your own case. It doesn't matter which one.

, Remember, which cases you choose doesn't matter; you're just as likely to do well whether you choose in order (e.g. 1, 2, 3...) or at random (e.g. 24, 7, 16...).

, This is the hard part, and is covered more extensively in the Tips section below.


The number of cases you have to open varies by round. From the time you pick your case to the time the deal/no deal button needs to be pressed, you'll have to pick 6 cases. Each successive round there after, will require you to pick the past round's amount minus one (in round 2, you'll have to pick 5 cases instead of 6, and 4 cases in round 3, 3 cases in round 4, 2 cases in round 5, and 1 case until all other cases but one are shown onstage. After a no deal decision has been reached, you'll be able to switch cases if you'd like.

Common character ideas include: robots, astronauts, literal statues (e.g. “The Thinker”), and mimes.For ideas or inspiration, look through pictures of living statues online, or go to an area of a nearby city in which living statues frequently perform.;
, Start by visiting costume stores or novelty shops to find the necessary wigs and clothing for your costume. If you’d like to custom make your own costume, you can visit a fabric store to purchase an appropriate color and style of fabric, and then sew your own costume.If you have the option, choose a cotton fabric for your costume. Cotton holds its color well, even if you’re performing in rain or snow.

, To flesh out your appearance as a human statue, you can accessorize with objects to wear and hold.Look for objects that match your overall theme: if you’re a robot, hold an imitation computer; if you’re a statue, hold a book to “read”; if you’re a pirate, hold a plastic sword and hook.


Sometimes just going shopping will be enough to inspire the costume, character, and actions you choose to perform. Yard sales, thrift shops and antique shops are best. You’re bound to find something odd that will spark your inspiration.
Other helpful places for props are home improvement stores (if you’re looking for mechanical items) and fabric and craft stores. Items found at these types of stores may spark your creativity and give you ideas of how to accessorize your statue character.

, Many living statues cover themselves completely in makeup, to give them the appearance of being a statue, robot, or other non-human character. Depending on your natural skin tone, white makeup works best; copper and silver are other popular face-paint colors.You should be able to find costume makeup at a costume or hobby store, or through most online retailers.


If using a white or non-metallic color, use water based cake-makeup as opposed to oil based. If you use oil, dust it with a finishing powder so it doesn’t smudge.
In order to draw attention to your eyes, you may want to line them in brown or black with regular eyeliner.Adding extra makeup (like lipstick or blush) on top of your solid base may be necessary, but keep it minimal unless the makeup is an essential part of your costume.

, Since you’ll largely be standing still, you need to find an easy pose, at least at first. Exert only a small amount of energy by relying on your bones to hold you up, instead of relying on muscles to keep you in a contorted position. Keep your arms low and close to your body, feet shoulder-width apart, and avoid contorting your torso.Don’t force yourself to balance in an uncomfortable position. If you’re just starting out, you could even incorporate a chair or the wall of a building into your positions, to help support your body weight.
As you become more used to working as a living statue, you’ll develop patience, and you’ll learn to ignore small distractions from your body, including minor itches or a building sneeze.

, Although a practiced living statue can hold a single pose for over two hours, a beginner will find it difficult to hold a pose for 15 minutes. You can make gradual movements to switch poses: lower or raise your arms, bend at your waist, straighten your back, or try innovating new positions on your own.Shifting poses frequently will prevent you from developing cramps or falling over.


Conversely, sudden and dramatic movements can take your audience by surprise and wow them. By interspersing dramatic arm and torso movements into your living-statue routine, you can give yourself opportunities to move and to further engage the audience.

, Control your breathing when you’re trying to hold a pose for a long period of time. Breathe deeply and slowly into your abdomen, then your chest. As your breaths slow, it will create the illusion of total immobility, which will impress audience members.For some living statues, the experience of standing perfectly still and breathing slowly can begin to feel like meditation. Time can pass quickly in this state, so don’t forget to look at your watch from time to time.

, When a human statue comes to life, it’s common for the performer to perform an action or give something away.What you give away doesn’t have to be tangible; it can be something as simple as a glance or gesture. However, your action or gesture needs to be meaningful; it should be a moment in which you connect with the human being in front of you and look them in the eye.


If you have a talent, use it. For example, you can draw in viewers and surprise audience members by blowing bubbles, creating origami, performing coin tricks, or playing an instrument.
If someone leaves money, you can surprise them by performing an action: blow a kiss, tip your hat, or take a dramatic bow.

, If you’d like to be seen by as many passers-by as possible (and consequently receive as many tips as possible), you’ll need to select a location with a high level of pedestrian traffic. Street performers commonly set up along walking malls, large sidewalks and street corners, or in large public parks or gardens. Make sure to avoid areas where “No Busking” signs are prominently posted.You’ll also need to confirm that you can legally perform and solicit money in the area that you select. Generally, busking is legal on public property. Most large cities will have publically available busking guidelines posted online. Consult these, or speak with other buskers to determine where you can and cannot perform., Living statues often work as buskers and rely on their performance as a part of their income. Passing pedestrians who appreciate your costume and talent will often linger and join other individuals to watch you in full statue costume. If you have a hat, bucket, or jar set out, appreciative audience members will drop in money.If you’re only planning to perform as a living statue as a hobby and don’t want to make an income from the work, you don’t need to put out a collections bucket.

, Resist the urge to jump out at toddlers and young children to startle them. The idea of a large grey statue coming to life and frightening a child could potentially give them nightmares. If you treat your audience members—especially children—with hostility, your audience will soon stop giving you money.


Some people dislike being near living statues and find them creepy due to their realism. If anybody complains, simply inform them that you are doing this as performance art, not to try to disturb people.

, Unfortunately, some individuals find it funny to harass, heckle, or otherwise bother and assault living statues. There are various ways that living can statues can discourage hecklers and protect themselves from hasslers.You can try various techniques, and find one that works for you and your costume.


For example, when dealing with unruly teenagers or adults, jumping out and scaring them away can be a defense that allows you to stay in character. This applies to any people who try to touch you or generally treat you poorly.

, If you have tried to discourage hecklers while staying in character, you may need to break character and speak to persistent hecklers.

The Next menu consideration is based on how well you can genuinely cook.,
So for the starter people are often impressed with prawns or scallops, try not to do a pastry tart because no one is fooled about how hard it is to make.,
For the main course stew will not cut it, neither will pie.. Good choices are risotto (hard to get right), steak (cooked well, and to the liking of the guests) randomly, skate wings won once so that might be worth a go.

,
You can live or die on the quality of a pudding, so obviously jelly is always a bad choice.,A menu based on weight watchers is always something of let down

,When the guests arrive always be incredibly fake and nice to other people and never reveal your game plan to the camera because they will use your admissions to make you look stupid

,
Never be a wine buff.,
After the meal do not attempt to get your guests to do any of the following - belly dancing, magic tricks, origami, flambeing pancakes, wii tennis, smoking pot or anything to do with spiritualism, they will all be horrible and the guests will talk about you behind your back.

",How to Win at Come Dine With Me," If you are lucky enough to get picked then the work must start, you have to be prepared.;
,, (Don't worry if you can't, half the time the best meal doesn't even win) Always make sure that you will have time to cook what you want on the day, preferably make stuff that you can do in advance (like pate or pots of soup).

, Souffle will win you points, as will terrine or homemade pate, if you're well pretentious either shoot or rear your own ingredients.

,, Nice little individual puddings are a good choice, obscure fruit and homemade ice cream can fail spectacularly, so go with a chocolate pud or if your good with pastry now is the time to show it!

Learn foot positions.,
Practice arm movements.,
Study how to plie.,
Practice releve.,
Try a saute.",How to Make a Dance Routine2," Ballet comes with a variety of positions for your feet, broken down into five different categories. If you're interested in doing a ballet inspired routine, familiarize yourself with the different foot positions. Each position involves rotating the legs at a 90 degree angle from the hip joint. If you're new to ballet, do not expect to be able to do a full rotation right away. Also, third positions is rarely used anymore as it's considered too similar to fifth position.In the first position, you stand with your legs together and your toes pointed away from your body. You should turn your toes as straight as you can, ideally forming a straight line.The second position is a continuation of the first position. You spread your legs apart slightly, keeping your toes pointed outward.Fourth positions involves pointing your toes inward, so your feet are turned to face each other. Then, cross your legs.Fifth position is a continuation of fourth position. Push your feet slightly closer together., Just as there are different positions for your legs in ballet, there are also different positions for your feet. Spend some time practicing the different placements of your arms if you're interested in doing a ballet routine.


In first position, bend your arms slightly at the elbow and hold them out in front of your body.In second position, stretch your arms out on either side of your body.In third position, keep your arms at your side, but raise one arm up over your head.In fourth position, keep one arm over your head. Bend the other arm inward, as you did in first position.In fifth position, raise both your arms over your head. Keep your elbows slightly bent., A plie (plee-ay) is a basic ballet move. It simply means ""to bend."" Bend your knees, with your feet pointing away from your body. Try to get your knees to bend until they're directly above your toes., Releve (ruh-lee-vey) is a ballet move in which you rise slightly. It can be done using one or both feet. Push your feet together while keeping your knees straight. Lift your heels into the air, transferring your body weight onto the balls of your feet. You should not attempt to stand on the tips your toes without proper training as well as shoes., A saute (soh-tay) is a basic ballet jump in which you use both feet at the same time. Begin with a plie and then use your feet as if you were going to perform a releve. In doing so, jump into the air. Straighten your legs as you jump and then land on both feet."

Keep your posture proper.,
Learn the rock step.,
Try the grapevine.,
Use a basic triple step.",How to Make a Dance Routine3," If you're going to attempt a ballroom dancing routine, your posture is of utmost importance. Before attempting any ballroom steps, work on developing proper posture.


Keep your chin parallel to the floor. Hold your head upright.Lift your chest in order to lengthen your spine.Stand on both feet. Keep your weight placed just slightly forward of your body's center., The rock step is a basic ballroom move. This can be fun to use if you're creating your own dance routine.


The rhythm used in the rock step is ""one and two, three and four."" You'll have to think of these words while dancing to keep your rhythm steady.Stand with your feet together. Lift one foot. Cross this foot behind the other foot. Place the foot roughly 12 inches behind the other foot, trying to form something of a 45 degree angle.
Transfer your weight to your back foot, standing on the ball of your foot. Count ""one"" as you do this. Immediately shift your weight back to your front foot, counting ""and."" Return your feet to the original position, counting ""two.""Three and four follow the exact same steps. You simply reverse which foot goes in front and which foot goes in back., The grapevine is a simple step for a fast-paced ballroom dance routine. One foot steps directly to the side. The other foot crosses that foot. You repeat this process continually, altering feet., A triple step is a basic ballroom dance move. You could use this in a ballroom routine or just a dance routine in general. It's a bit faster and less balanced than the rock step, so it may take some time to perfect.


Like the rock step, the triple step is counted ""one and two, three and four."" However, ""one and"" and ""three and"" are counted quicker than the other steps.Stand with your feet together and then lift and step forward with your right foot. Count ""one"" as you do this and then quickly shift your weight onto your left foot while counting ""and."" Shift back to the right foot, counting ""two.""Use the count of three to move your left foot forward. For the remainder of the steps, repeat the above motion but use your left foot to step forward instead."
"
Learn to count steps.,
Practice leading and following.,
Learn to dance to music.",How to Make a Dance Routine4," In salsa dancing, time is kept in 8 counts. This means steps a performed over 8 beats of music. After 8 beats, you return to your original position and prepare to engage in the steps again.The type of steps you would do the 8 beats vary depending on what kind of dance routine you end up forming. However, to give you a basic idea of a dance routine here is an example. If you're the partner's who's leading in a routine, try something like this. Hold the beat for the first step, step forward with your left foot, rock back with your right foot, step back with your left foot, hold the beat, step back with your right foot, rock forward with your left foot, then step forward with your right. After engaging in these 8 steps, return to the original position and start again.For the follower in the above scenario, you would do something like this. Hold the beat, step back with the right foot, rock forward on the left foot, step back with the right foot, hold the beat, step forward with your left foot, rock back on your right foot, and then step back with your left foot. Return to the starting position and begin again., In salsa dancing, there is one leader and one follower. You'll need a partner to do a salsa dance routine. Establish who leads and who follows between yourself and your partner. The leader usually establishes the moves during the routine, giving the follower small signals via gentle tugs and pushes in the right direction. The job of the follower is to move his or her feet more or less in the opposite direction of the follower. Traditionally, a man leads and a woman follows but you of course do not have to follow this rule in your own routine., As salsa follows and 8 step, you need to learn to rely on dancing to music. It would be very hard to do a salsa routine without a song accompanying your dance. Spend some time listening carefully to music, trying to hear the beat in the back of a song. Count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and follow this beat as you go through the 8 moves of your salsa routine. Keep in mind, when choosing music, you'll need to pick something with a clear, distinct rhythm for your routine to work.

Consider a hip-hop routine.,
Look into modern dance.,
Look into dance classes.",How to Make a Dance Routine5," If you want to make your own dance routine, spend some time exploring different dance types. One fun type of dance his hip hop. Look into forming a hip-hop dance routine.


Dubstep is a type of music that involves percussion beats and bass patterns. Many hip hop dancers move to the beat of dubstep during their dances. Watch YouTube and other tutorial videos that show you how to ""pop"" to dubstep. This is important when compiling a hip hop routine.Breakdancing, which involves full use of the body, is also popular in hip hop. There are many online resources that show you basic break dance moves and how to incorporate them into a hip-hop routine.Attitude is important in hip-hop as well. Make sure you commit to each move and have confidence. Even if you don't feel like you've mastered a move yet, if you perform with confidence people might not notice., Modern dance can be another fun type of dance to incorporate into your dance routine. If you're concerned about coordination, modern dance can be fun as it encourages free movement.


You can freestyle to modern dance routines. You can move your body in response to themes like ""Peace"" or scenes like ""the ocean."" Move freely and pick positions that seem to reflect the theme.You can also make a modern dance routine with a group. Try to coordinate moves together or freestyle moves one at a time in response to a central theme or idea., There are many different types of dances you can use in a personal dance routine. Depending on your personal interests, look into different types of dance classes.


If you're interested in classic dance routines, the kinds of dancing that requires a partner, consider a ballroom dancing class. You'll learn classic routines like the waltz, tango, cha-cha, rumba, and more. You can manipulate these dances to your liking in your own personal routine.Jazz classes can teach you dances like the Charleston, the swing, and other fun routines. Once you master these types of dance routines, you can manipulate them and make them your own.Latin dances, like the salsa or flamingo, can also be fun. Look for latin dance classes in your area.Dances like ballet and tap dance require a certain level of mastery and come with very specific rules. If you're interested in tap dancing or ballet, taking classes is important if you want to create your own routine.If you want to learn a very specific type of dance and form your own routine, classes are important. You can learn some from watching videos online, but if you want to create your own routine based on a specific dancing tradition that requires a certain level of mastery. Having one-on-one instructions from a professional can really help you form your own routine.

Discern your method of jumping.,
Now, we learn how to heel-click.,
Now practice heel clicking while jumping.,
Add a side kick to the series!,
Learn how to fall.,
Finished.

",How to Heel Click," First, figure out how you jump (lifting your feet up off of the ground at the same time tends to help). Once you get good at this possibly alien sensation of jumping, work on jumping so that your heels are lined up with your shoulders.;
, If you are unsure of exactly how to do this, a good trick is to sit on a chair and let your heels dangle in the air. Now, bring them together and make a sharp, snapping sound. Get the idea?

, Jump one more time to re-acquaint yourself with the feeling. The next time you jump, bring your heels together like you did in Step Two. Start out clicking in the center of your legs (rather than to one side or the other) so that you can get acclimated to the trick of clicking and landing without losing your footing and making a fool of yourself (which will promptly dissipate any good feeling toward you from your audience that you may have received for your oh-so-nifty heel-click).

, Now that you've (hopefully) mastered the art of 'Center Heel-Clicking', it's time to try heel-clicking to the side. The next time that you jump, kick your left leg out to the side. Bring your right leg to your left, heel-click, and attempt to land without killing yourself. Killing yourself is a very bad thing that, once again, will promptly dissipate any good feeling toward you from your audience.

, If you fall, you have two options. If you are in front of an audience and acting something out, you're going to need to do some pretty nifty improvisation to convince them that this fall was on purpose. Don't break your character and no one will notice. If you are not doing it in character or anything, then get up, smile, and laugh at yourself. Explain to whomever is watching you that you have just learned how to heel-click (it may be helpful to explain that you only learned from a very bad wikiHow article, in fact) and then continue with whatever you were doing before. If people ask you to try again, politely tell them 'no.' Practice more before you try to show people.

Pick a song.,
Learn through observation.,
Study dancing.,
Put your moves together in a way that feels fun for you.,
Practice consistently.",How to Make a Dance Routine6," If you're forming a dance routine, you'll need to choose a musical accompaniment. Choose a song that you like, first of all, as you'll dance better if you're enjoying yourself. You're more likely to have fun dancing to a song you love. Also, keep in mind the style of the music and how it matches the routine you're creating. If you want to do a graceful, ballroom style routine choose a slow song. If you want a fun, peppy routine look into dance music and club music.

, Dancing is like any other practice. You can learn a lot through simple observation. If you want to create a dance routine, spend a lot of time exploring dance routines online.


You can explore dance routines on YouTube. Simply typing in ""dance routine"" in the search bar should yield a lot of results. You may even find tutorials on how to to do specific moves on YouTube and other video sharing sites.
Consider attending a dance class just to watch. You can catch a lot in terms of form, choreography, and dance moves simply by observing a class. Talk to a local dance instructor and see if he or she would let you come watch a class.Watch for events in your town or area that involve dancing. If affordable for you, consider buying tickets to events that involve dancing. This can help you find inspiration.

, Dancing is an art and people study for years to dance properly. Even if you're just forming a dance routine for fun, studying dancing can help.


Enroll in a dance or choreography class. Learn about the art and style of dance from trained professionals.
Go to your local library or bookstore and find books about dancing and choreography.

, After getting inspired and studying a variety of dance styles, put it all together. Using the moves you've learned, altered, or created, put together a fun routine for yourself. Remember to pay attention to the beat and style of the music. It might be a good idea to record yourself dancing and watch the recording. This way, you can see where your routine might need improvement.

, Dancing requires a certain level of mastery that can only be achieved through practice. Try to make time each day to dance. Work practicing your routine into your schedule as you would brushing your teeth or eating dinner. Set aside an hour each day to work on your routine.

Look for free streaming sites.,
Subscribe to a streaming site for a higher quality video.,
Confirm the link is correct and functional.,
Decide if you are going to stream or download the episodes.,
Set up several links in different browsers.,
Allow the film to load.,
Reload the page if the film is choppy or stops loading.",How to Watch Naruto," You can do a search online for a specific Naruto television episode or for all the Naruto films on one streaming site. Once you click on the site and open it, it should specify if there is a fee to use the site or to access the content on the site. If you are trying not to spend any money on your Naruto viewing, you may opt for sites that are free for use.Be wary of sites that ask you to sign up for service or register for service. These sites will often later request a form of payment to subscribe to the content on the site and access it.;
, If you are planning on watching several Naruto films, you may want to subscribe to a streaming site. You will likely need to pay a subscription fee every month to have access to the films, which are often higher quality than those found on free sites. The subscription fee may also give you access to other content on the streaming site, such as other manga films and shows.Make sure you read the fine print on the subscription before you sign up for the site. This will ensure you know exactly how much you are paying each month to watch content on the site.

, If you are using a free site, you may want to try several different links for the Naruto film. Some of the links may appear broken or not load properly so always check that they open before settling in to watch the film.


If you are using a subscription service, you will likely have access to links to the film that are confirmed by the service. These links should function properly.
You should also confirm the link has English subtitles or subtitles that are in a language that you understand. Often the link will note ""English subtitles"" or ""dubbing available"", which indicates the link has subtitles or dubbing in English.

, Streaming online content is considered less legally dubious than downloading online content. This is because when you stream content from an online site or service, you are accessing the data for consumption but you are not keeping it or storing it anywhere on your computer. When you download content from an online site or service, you are in fact storing the data on your computer and can potentially redistribute or sell this content to others.Many online sites offer a streaming option or a downloading option. If you are planning to watch the Naruto episodes once and then move on, you should choose the streaming option. Plus, with streaming there is a lower risk of breaking the law when you watch content online.

, If you are using a free streaming service, you should maximize your chances of loading a good link to the film by loading several links in different windows of the same browser or in different browsers. This will allow you to determine which link is loading fastest and use that link.


If you are using a subscription service, you do not need to worry about loading different links to the film. However, you may want to load more than one film at a time in different windows if you are planning on watching several Naruto films in a row.

, The film will likely take time to load fully. Letting the film load will ensure the film plays through properly and does not become choppy or lag.


You may need to wait fifteen to twenty minutes to allow the film to load once you open it, depending on how big the file is. Do this by pressing the play button and then press the pause button to allow the bottom bar on the screen to load fully to the end.

, You may find that the film becomes choppy or pauses and tries to load as you watch it. You can adjust this by reloading the entire page, including the link, to allow the streaming service to reconnect to its server.


If reloading does not work, you can try closing the link and then re opening it. You may want to note where the film stopped so you can pick up where you left off when you re open it.

, Move furniture and other obstacles aside. Make sure the area is not slippery.

, Especially when you first start. It helps you build your confidence rather than when you are being watched.

, If no mirror is available, a glass door or large window can provide some feedback, too. It helps to stand on the more brightly lit side.

, Something upbeat with plenty of drama and variety is a good place to start. Try many different songs and styles to find what works for you.

, As you warm up, vary your steps and start to move your upper body any way that seems to go with the music.

, Arms, hands, legs, and feet are the obvious ones, but don't forget shoulders, knees, head, chest, hips and everything else. Notice what looks good and what feels good. Notice what works with your music.

, If you're extending a hand, for instance, follow with your chest and head and use your legs. Unless you intend to keep something motionless, you'll just end up looking stiff.

, Think about the shape and posture of your whole body.

, Pantomime the words. Get bigger when the music gets louder; get faster when the music gets faster.

, Shake, turn, move with the music. Intensity doesn't necessarily mean speed, though. A slow motion can be every bit as intense and deliberate as a quick one.

, Dance is an amplification of body language you already know. Does your music call for you to puff up your chest and strut, or shrink sadly away?

, Also watch anybody else moving. Martial artists, figure skaters, actors on a stage, soccer players, and children can all suggest ways to move.

, This is your own creation, so there's no reason that elements of belly dancing and ballet can't blend.

, Step on a beat when the music is still, subdivide the beat, change direction mid-measure or mid-phrase, and occasionally do something a bit contrary to the mood of the music.

The girl should hold the guys hand, in midair, gracefully. The partners should be looking at each other, so that they can maintain their presence, and concentration., The girl walks in front of the guy. First her left foot, and then her right. The girl's body should remain perpendicular to that of the guy's. Both partners should continue to hold each other's hands, and maintain eye contact., Both partners lock with each other's bodies. This first involves the girl moving her arm. She will unlock hands with the guy, and place her arm underneath the guy's shoulder, placing her hand on his back. The guy releases his hand from the girl, and places his arm around her back. Placing his hand underneath the girl's armpit., The guys arm should remain strong. The arm should remain straight as it rests on the girls back. Make sure it does not buckle. This arm is the pivot point of the ferris wheel. Try to tense your muscles so that you can create some extra strength. The girl's body will revolve around this arm., The guy should place his right arm behind the girl's right knee. The guy's right arm is what will create the momentum and the force that is used to swing the girl around. The guy will want to put almost his entire weight into the right arm, while keeping the left arm straight and locked., The girl swings up her left leg. The girl should keep both legs equidistant apart from one another. The kicking movement upwards should be smooth, and straight. This kick upwards is what will springboard the entire ferris wheel dance move., The guy maintains both his right and left hand positions. As the girl is swinging in the air, the guy holds his left arm straight and on her back. This will create a pivot point for the procedure. The guy will also maintain the right hand presence. This will keep your girl from falling as she is swinging in midair., Bend your knees as the girl comes down. When the girl comes down, the guy should bend his knees, as well as the girl. If you do not bend your knees, this could cause unforced pressure on your knees, and a potential injury.

, Once both dancers are safely on the ground, with their knees bent, the girl and guy should both lift up their knees. You can take a bow, or lift up your hands. You can also go straight back to dancing or into another specialized dance move., At first, if you are practicing, do the move at a moderate speed. Remember, you need enough momentum to get the girl in the air. When you are in the air, you can take the swinging motion pretty slow. If you are dancing on the dance floor do the move pretty fast, which will amaze your audience, and look more professional.

This will provide leverage for the girl to hold onto as she is being moved, and swung. Both partners should be facing each other as their hands hold together., The girl steps back with her right leg. As both partners continue to hold hands, the girl first steps back and then steps forward, into the guy's chest area (about 6 inches away). As the girl does this, she lets go of the guy's hands and wraps her hands around his neck. The girl should maintain a tight grip around the guy's neck, because this will keep her from falling., The guy wraps his hands around the girls hips. As the girl breaks away from holding hands, the guy should immediately place his hands on her hips. Make sure that his hands maintain a tight grip. The guy should try and position the girls hips to his right, because that is where the first swinging motion will take place., The girl lifts her legs up into the air. The girl should kick her legs to the guy's right side. As she does this, the guy maintains his grip on her hips. He swings her back, to his right side, never letting her touch the ground. He then swings her back up, in front of him, holding her in midair., The guy swings her to his left side. As the guy maintains her position in midair in front of him, he then swings her back to his left side. This should all be done without letting her touch the ground. The guy then brings her back up to the midair position again., The guy rests her on the ground. After the guy has the girl in midair, he swings her down beneath his legs. He then, calmly rests her on the ground, trying to not bang her head against the floor. Make sure the guy's stance is wide enough that the girl can slide easily through. She should be laying on the ground, her face looking up at the guy's pants legs., The guy turns his body around. At the resting point, the guy should be able to look down at the girl's face. To do the next step, the guy needs to change positions. The guy should simply turn his body around. Still in the same position, above the girls face, except now he is facing her legs., The girl raises her arms up to the guy's arms. Both partners should hold hands using a thumb handhold (thumbs on tip of one another's). This will form a tight grip for the next flip. The guy should flex his elbows so that there is room to flip the girl upwards., The girl lifts her legs upwards. She then wraps them around the guy's back, crossing her feet. The guy maintains strength in his arms, and tight grip around her hands. The girl's hips should press against the back of the guy's palms, so the guy can maintain the brunt of the weight as he flips her., The guy flips the girl upwards. The guy straightens his back, as the girl comes up in front of him. The partners maintain strong grips with their hands so that the girl does not fall. The guy then lowers the girl to the ground. Both partners bend their knees and lift up again, maintaining a resting position., Especially with the initial side-to-side lift, you want to do that fast, otherwise the guy might lose his balance, or not be able to hold the girl's weight. In the second flip upwards, the guy can hold her midair as long as he likes, before lowering her to the ground. The faster you perform the moves together, the more crisp and professional it will look. Practice slowly first, and then gradually build up your speed.

The guy puts out his right arm, while the girl put out her left. Both hands grab onto one another. If the partners are too close, step slightly to the sides until the interlocked arms are straightened., The girl turns her body towards the guy. This means that the girl will slightly twirl to her left, and step towards the guy with her right foot (foot pointed towards his body). This should be done with both partners' hands still interlocked. The girl continues to twirl a second time until her interlocked hand is on her left hip. This entire move should be a 360 degree turn by the girl., The girl then lifts up her left leg. The guy catches her left leg with the upper part of his left forearm. The left hand of the guy wraps tightly around the girl's left leg, and pulls her up. The guy should now be supporting her midair. His left arm around her left leg, and his right hand still interlocked with her left hand. The girl should be facing away from the guy., The girl locks her legs together. This will make it easier for the guy to spin the girl around. The guy then makes a full, 360 degree turn, holding the girl in midair. The guy should maintain a tight grip at all times, otherwise the girl could fall down., The guy shifts his left hand and switches his grip. He goes from holding the girl's left leg, to holding her right leg. The guy then pushes the girl's body forward with his chest, twirling the girl forward. As he does this, his hand is still interlocked, and his other hand grasps ahold of her leg. The girl can then spray her right arm outwards., The guy lifts up on the girl's right leg slightly. The guy then lets go of the girls leg, and lets her come to the ground on her two feet. Both partners bend their knees, and lift up. Finally, the partners can release their hands., It may take a few days of practice. The first step, getting the girl in the guy's arms, should be your first goal. Once you are in that position, the guy really has full control. He then can spin around fairly easily. The most difficult step is the last. Just make sure the guy's grip is tight enough so that she does not fall when twirling outwards.

, The man should take one step forward with his left foot. This step must be a slow one.


The woman's part follows the lead of the man's part. As such, the woman should step back once with her right foot as her partner steps forward.

, The man must take a step forward with his right foot. This step should also be a slow one.


In response to the man's part, the woman should move by stepping back once with her left foot.

, The man must take one Sidestep with his left foot. Move the left foot to the left and slightly forward. This is the first quick step of the forward basic.


The woman follows the man's lead by side stepping swiftly with her right foot. Move your right foot to the right and slightly backward.

, If taking the leading man's part, you must quickly bring your right foot to the side of your left foot. This is another quick step, and your feet should be back in the closed position when done.


For the woman's part, quickly close your feet together by gliding your left foot over to the side of your right foot.
Note that for the entire step, the rhythmic pattern both parts should follow is ""slow, slow, quick, quick."" Another way of putting it is that each of the first two steps should take a count of two to complete, while each of the last two steps should take a count of one to complete., You could mix in a few back basics by simply reversing the forward basic. In other words, the man will move backward while the woman moves forward.This move is not often danced in practical application since it requires the man to lead blindly backward, but it can still be worth knowing.
The man must lead by taking a slow step back with the left foot, followed by a slow step back with the right. He then takes a quick step to left and slightly back before closing his right foot quickly to the left foot.
The lady follows by moving her right foot forward slowly, followed by her left foot. She then takes a quick step to the right side and slightly forward before finally closing her left foot to the right.

, From a closed position, the man takes one slow step forward with his left foot.The woman must once more mirror the man's steps in this move. From a closed position, she should walk back once with her right foot. This should be a slow step.
Note that a ""closed position"" merely means that both dancers stand with their feet together.

, The dancer assuming the man's role must take one quick step with the right foot, moving that foot forward and to the right simultaneously.


For dancers assuming the woman's role, take one quick step with the left foot to the back and diagonally to the left side.

, The man must close the feet again by quickly bringing his left foot to the side of his right.


Conversely, the woman follows by quickly drawing her right foot back, placing it next to her left foot.
For both dancers, the flow of steps should be ""slow, quick, quick.""

, At this point in the box step, you will essentially reverse your movements until you nearly return to the starting point. The man must take a slow step back with his right foot.


The woman must move forward during this part of the box step. To mirror the man's movement, take a slow step forward once with the left foot.

, The man must now take a quick step with the left foot to the back and diagonally toward the left side.


For the woman's role, take a quick step forward with the right foot, moving it diagonally forward and to the right.

, Finish the box step by bringing your right foot back to the side of the left foot.


The woman must drag her left foot forward and to the right to meet with her right foot in a closed position.
Note that this reversed portion of the move must also follow the ""slow, quick, quick"" rhythm.

, From a starting position, the man must take one slow step forward with the left foot.


To follow, the woman must take one step back with her right foot.
Note that the default turn is a left turn, also known as a ""hesitation left turn"" or ""ad lib.""
Turns are used to change the direction of movement in the middle of the dance.
A ""starting position"" merely refers to a closed position, or one in which both partners stand with their feet closed together.

, The man must take a slow step back with his right foot.


For the woman's part, step forward instead of stepping back. More specifically, step forward once, slowly, with the left foot.

, This is the moment during which the actual turn will be made. The dancer taking the man's role must Sidestep quickly with his left foot while simultaneously rotating to the left. Usually, the rotation is a quarter turn to the left, but it could also be as little as an eighth turn or as much as a three-eighths turn.


The dancer with the woman's role must follow her partner closely at this point. Sidestep to the right with the right foot. Rotate to the right as lead partner indicates, whether that rotation is a quarter turn, an eighth turn, or a three-eighths turn.

, The man concludes the step by quickly closing his right foot to the left foot.


Similarly, the woman mirrors the man's movements by quickly closing her left foot to the right foot.
Note that this step maintains the basic ""slow, slow, quick, quick"" rhythm.

, Since dancers usually move counter-clockwise around the room, there is not much need for a right turn. If the need does arise for one, though, you can complete a turn to the right by simply reversing the steps for a standard left turn.For the man's part, move the left foot back slowly. The right foot should brush toward the left foot without any weight on it. Slowly move the right foot forward once, then move the left foot to the left side. While moving the left foot to the side, rotate to the right with an eighth, quarter, or three-eighths turn. Close the right foot to the left to complete the move.
For the woman's part, move the right foot forward slightly, brushing it toward the left foot. Take a slow step back with the left foot, followed by a quick step to the right with the right foot. Turn as directed by leading partner. Finish the move by closing the left foot to the right.

, At the start of this movement, both the man and woman must stand facing each other. Both dancers must also stand with their feet closed together.


A promenade allows the dancers to travel sideways. Unlike other steps, you will need to turn your head away from your partner as you step.

, When taking the lead role or man's role, turn your head and upper body to the left from your starting position. Take one slow step with your left foot in the same direction.


When taking the woman's role, turn your head and upper body to the right. Simultaneously take one slow step with your right foot in the same direction.

, The man must take a second slow step to the left using his right foot. As he steps, his right foot must glide past the front of the left foot, ending up to the left side of the left foot.Similarly, the woman must take a second slow step to the right using her left foot. As she moves her left foot, it must glide in front of the right foot and ultimately end up on the right side of the right foot.

, The man must take a quick Sidestep with his left foot. At this point, he should also turn his head and upper body back toward his partner, and his left foot should be well to the left of his right foot again. His left foot should pass behind his right foot as he moves.


The woman responds by taking a quick Sidestep with her right foot while also turning her head and upper body back to face him. Her right foot should move behind the left foot and end up well to the right of it at the end of the step.

, Finish the step from the man's role by closing the right foot next to the left foot quickly. Continue looking at your partner as you do this.


From the woman's role, quickly close the left foot next to the right foot while continuing to face your partner.
Note that a promenade also follows the basic ""slow, slow, quick, quick"" rhythm.

Hold your arms straight, or pretend to hold a rifle.,
Wear the proper boots for goose stepping.,
Play marching music while you are practicing.,
Learn more difficult versions of the goose step.,
Try the North Korean goose step.,
Be mindful of the cultural stigma.",How to Goosestep," Start by standing with both of your feet together. Then, try to kick your left foot high enough that it is at about a 45 degree angle to the ground. You will need to balance on your right foot, which can take practice. Be gentle as you first start learning, and understand that it may take some practice before you can comfortably bring your leg all the way up to the correct height.Both knees should be as straight as possible as you kick.;
, Firmly plant it flat on the ground so the whole foot makes contact at once; do not let the heel hit before the rest of the foot. Planting your foot does not mean slamming it on the ground. Simply make sure that you have secure footing, with the toe pointed forward. For most versions of the goose step, it is incorrect to bring the foot down with excessive force.

, Keep both knees straight, and kick your right foot up. The goal is to get it at about a 45 degree angle from the ground for most goose steps; however, when you are just beginning, kicking that high may cause you to hurt yourself. Don’t push beyond what you’re capable of.


Certain countries, such as North Korea, use a goose step that has a higher kick than most other countries., Make sure you march with a deliberate, even rhythm. Try going outside or into a long hallway to practice to be sure that you have enough space to practice repetitions of the kicks.

, For example, you may wish to simply tilt your rifle forward 45 degrees (at a 135 degree angle with the ground) while marching. Otherwise, hold your arms at your sides.


Different countries have different arm movements for their goose step, so there may be a unique movement depending on the country whose goose step you want to imitate. The best way to imitate the arm movements of your country of interest is to do a YouTube search and watch a video of the soldiers marching.

, Goose stepping boots should have some weight, and should cover your ankles. This is to allow the ankles to turn with the boot, instead of the top of the boot getting in the way of the turning ankle.


The hobnailed jackboot is one type of boot that you could try. Germans call this book “Marschstiefel,” which means “marching boot.” These boots come to your mid-calf or higher, have no laces, and have a leather sole.

, It will help you coordinate your moves as you march to the beat of the music. Try searching some of these terms on YouTube to find music: Königgrätzer Marsch, Preußenmarsch (translates to ""Prussian March""), Tannenberg Marsch, Unsere Garde Marsch, Yorckscher Marsch., After learning a slow, ceremonial step, you may want to practice faster, more difficult versions of the march. You can familiarize yourself with the march you wish to learn by watching videos of soldiers performing it. Pay close attention to the angles of the legs, the way the feet are planted on the ground, and the movement of the arms.

, North Korea’s version of the goose step is bouncy, forceful, and very difficult to do. To try this goose step, you must keep your head straight, and lock your arms at a 90 degree angle. When kicking, try to raise your leg to almost horizontal to the ground. Then, slam your foot down to the ground with force. As you do, the other foot should erupt into the air, creating a bouncing or trotting effect., In English-speaking countries, the goose step is often associated with dictatorship, blind obedience, or with the Nazi regime of World War II. With that being said, the goose step is still used in many countries around the world. If you practice your goose step in public, be aware that people may ask you questions and some may seem offended."

Use the 6-count to complete the basic jive steps.,
Practice the steps without music.",How to Jive," Learning how to jive can be easy once you master the beginning steps or basic movement. There are 6 counts to the basic movement, and the beat sounds like: 1-2-3-a-4, 5-a-6. 








Counts 1 and 2 are called the “link steps” or ""rock steps”.
Counts 3 and 4 are a triple step to the left called a ""chasse”.
Counts 5 and 6 are a triple step, or ""chasse"" to the right.;
, The “chasse” in dance is when you glide one foot to the side.








In jive, these steps are three short and smooth movements to the side, so the movement is called a “triple step”.

, A “link step” or “rock step” is when you step one foot behind the other and then lift the front foot up.









The idea is to rock back on your back foot and then rock forward on your front foot, shifting the weight to your back foot and then to your front foot. However, you should always lift your feet up as you shift the weight backward and then forward.
Practice a few “rock steps” to get the feel for this move. It is an essential step to the jive.

, Leave your right foot in place and shift your weight to the back (left) foot. This is the 1 count.







, This is the 2 count of the rock step.








, This is the 3 count, or the first count in the triple step to the left.








, This is the “a” count, or the second count in the triple step.








, This is the 4 count, or third count in the triple step.








, This is the 5 count.








, This is the “a” count.








, This is the 6 count, or last count in the jive.








, Remember to use the 1-2-3-a-4, 5-a-6 count.








, Leave your left foot in place.







, This is the 2 count.








, This is the 3 count, or the first count in the triple step.








, This is the “a"" count, or the second count in the triple step.








, Leave your left foot in place. This is the 4 count, or the third count in the triple step.








, This is the 5 count.








, This is the “a” count.








, This is the 6 count, or final step in the jive.








, Remember to use the 1-2-3-a-4, 5-a-6 count.








, Jive is danced with the woman and the man facing each other. The man leads the jive and the woman follows his movements.








The man will start with his left foot and the woman will start with her right foot so that there is no bumping of knees and the dance moves smoothly.Imagine an invisible string connecting the man’s feet to the woman’s feet. As the man moves, the women’s movements should follow.

, This means the man will have his right hand on the left side of the woman’s upper back and the woman will have her left hand on the man’s right shoulder. The woman’s arm should sit above the man’s arm.









There should be roughly an arm’s length of distance between the man and the woman.
The man and woman’s other hands should be clasped together rather loosely. In jive, you don’t want to keep the arms too stiff or rigid. There should be a looseness to the arm position.

, Rotate your bodies so your feet are turned slightly away from each other at an angle.








This will allow you both to move freely without bumping knees.

, You can both count out loud to hit each count. Make sure the man begins on his left foot and the woman begins on her right foot.









Keep your arms loose and relaxed.

, This will help you master the basic jive movement and avoid getting distracted by the music.









Once you both feel comfortable with the basic jive steps, begin to jive to music. There are several popular mixes with good jive tracks available online.Jive music tends to have a faster tempo than swing music, so as you practice the steps and get better, you can also learn to move at a faster speed or tempo.
Mimic the music’s tempo by accenting your foot and leg movements. To do this, shift your hips as you shift your weight back to your left foot or your right foot in the rock step.
Keep your knees bent and try to highlight the counts in the music with the 6 counts in the jive steps.
Continue practicing the basic jive steps with accented movements to music until you both feel confident enough with the dance.

Form a circle lined with guests and players alike.,
Set a place for the bacteria to sit.,
Have the berraboi start the roda with seven strokes and the call of the Mestre's voice.,
The Lovasao will start the call and response of the roda.

,
Three beats into the Lovasao is generally when the pandeiros will start seven strikes on the second note of a four note beat.,
Sing the corridos -- these running songs are packed with energy.",How to Form a Roda," Have them sit in a circle or roda using the length of the berimbau to create the radius. You may also use your standing torso as the point of absolute center and your extended arm in addition to the berimbau as part of the radius.;
, Where the musicians can see everyone who approaches the roda to play of watch. Leave just enough room for relief musicians who are done play in the roda to walk behind the bacteria and release a person on an instrument without causing a train wreck in the flow of the music and gradual build up of the roda.


The first chair is for bass baring berimbau called the barraboi. The barraboi is the most masculine bau (sometimes called a gunga (gunga is also a term some use for all berimbaus- our lineage does not however interchange the terms) The berraboi will always play the feminine designate the beat or toque (touch) of Angola. Or If the next designated berimbau is calling for Santa Maria. then and only then will the berraboi play Benguela. The old man designate. For all other games the berraboi will always play toque de Angola.
The second chair is the viola, the word, neuter. the is the berimbau that will run the game. People will enter circle and exit into the roda/world from the foot of this berimbau. And they will end their bout here and back away from each other safely before the next match meets together to be signaled into being able to exit the rim of the circle and into the dance of the game off the ebbing skirtings of a fight. This berimbau will play what ever toque is deemed appropriate for the mood of the roda and the desired question of the two players or gamers (jogodors jogadores). This berimbau will also host the person who is expected to sing the most amount of songs that talk about the game in progress and to lead the cascade of syncopation the weaves in and out of the beat for all the musicians to ebb and play off of. If players don't comply with the game that is being asked for. Then it is the viola that will call them back acting like a railroad crossing arm in the roda to signal that a reset is necessary. This is done without causing a train wreck with the whole of the rest of the music.
The third chair is the violinha (alto/ nearly soprano berimbau). This berimbau is the feminine designate. But unlike the berraboi, she is out getting things done in the music. She imitates which ever beat or toque the viola is calling for. Or in game terms creating a chamada for. She will do the most variation, and hint at other games and toques that call those games but always revert to focus on what ever toque (beat) the viola is asking for.
The two pandeiros are the fourth and fifth chairs.
The Agogo is the sixth chair.
The Reco Reco is the seventh chair. It has the least syncopatable ability for all the Bacteria.
The Atabaque is the eighth chair. It has the greatest chance of getting out of hand. So it is the one removed first if people start showing off to much or if the start using force over guile, or gymnastics over cunning and safeguarded bravery.

, Three rounds in on the second note- the viola will strike seven times and join the berraboi on the second note of the four note beat. Three round of the beat after that the violin will start on the second note and strike seven times and join the at the second note on the eighth touch. The the Mestre or someone designated by the Mestra will call out and start to sing the litany Ladainha- the will choose one that fits the mood or politic of the roda.

,, The viola will either give praise to God. and the crowd will respectfully acknowledge the choice of the viola designate on the existence of such a being and agree to raise a viva to god and agree with their comrades. ""Ë ai viva Meu Dues!!!"" Everyone else present responds. ""E ai viva meu Dues, camara!"" The cantor may opt not to mention god and start with a via to their Mestre. For brevity, one may skip down the mention of galactic funnel from the Universal through byzantine to the natural world to the particulars players starting this event who need to be given permission to agree to disagree, in the circle, at this event. Once that particular is reached in song. then the two player are directed by call and response to exit the circle and enter the world as made metaphor by this game space area. As the players use guile to take out the other players thought life pieces to checkmate, not destroy, the opponents thought king ability to be a king in the ring. The Viola goes down between the two players like a railway arm... and when it comes up. One player will leave a target exposed for bait and the other will take the bait to begin the ritual and simultaneously leave out new bait of their own design. The one with the best bait leading to the best trap that leads to the least violent checkmate is the one the crowd and the viola sings for.

, The polite and publicly well behaved participant claps and sings at every roda if possible. Some rodas don't have clapping which is an element left over from sexism.

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.,
Move one foot forward.,
Hold your arms away from the body.,
Twist your hips.,
Shift your body weight.,
Dance to the beat.",How to Do the Twist1," Put equal weight on both feet. Keep your knees flexible and your torso squared evenly with your hips.


There is not a set position your feet must be in to do the twist, but if your legs are too close together, the movements might seem too stiff. Similarly, if your legs are too far apart, you might be able to balance yourself better but ultimately have difficulty keeping the beat.
Use the shoulder-width rule as a guideline but experiment with different stances until you find one that feels natural and comfortable.;
, Gently budge one foot ahead of the other. The front foot should not be a full length ahead of the back foot, and there should be some overlap between them.


Note that this is technically optional, even though it is fairly standard. You can still do the twist while keeping both feet in the same place.

, Extend both arms outward and away from the body. Don’t extend them straight out. You should keep them bent slightly at the elbow. Imagine your arms are in a runner's position, but looser.


The upper part of your arms should be held close to the body, and your elbows should point inward just a bit. The lower part of your arms should be held diagonally out and upward. Keep your wrists and hands loose.
As you twist, your arms will follow the movement of your hips. As your weight shifts to one side and your waist twists back, the arm of that same side will naturally move downward and back. To keep balance, the other arm should move upward and forward.

, Swing your hips dramatically from side to side. As you twist your hips, your waist and legs should also twist or rotate from side to side in a similar manner.Rotate your torso as you rock your hips. As you rock or swing your hips to the right side, your torso and waist need to rotate toward your front right side. As you do this, your right leg also needs to shift forward.
When you rock your hips to the left, the left side of your waist needs to rotate forward as the right side shifts back. Your left legs should shift forward as it follows the natural movement of your hips and waist.

, As you rock from side to side, shift your center of gravity or body weight so that it is supported by the ball of your foot. You should alternate from foot to foot, placing your weight over one foot as you twist to that side and over to the other foot as you twist back.


The important thing to remember as you twist is to keep your body down. By shifting your weight from side to side, your body will usually have a natural tendency to stay low. This is further supported by keeping your legs gently bent at the knees. Staying low is important if you want to do the dance correctly, but it also helps you to maintain your balance more effectively., You need to be on the rhythm of the song you dance to. To help maintain the rhythm of the dance, make sure that each full twist lands on a beat.


Take it slow at first if you have a hard time picking it up. Instead of dancing with music in the background, practice in silence and count the beats out loud as you twist back and forth.
Practice in front of a body length mirror. Doing so grants you the chance to watch your moves as you practice."
"
Switch directions.,
Go low.,
Move one leg at a time.,
Lift your leg.,
Wave your arms.,
Go round and round.,
Add claps.,
Take a leap.",How to Do the Twist2," As you twist, you will usually notice that you will favor one side more than the other. If you moved one foot forward at the start of the dance, odds are, that will be the side you twist to more dramatically. To switch directions, simply slide your original forward foot back and bring your original back foot forward. Your body will naturally begin swinging more dramatically to the new side., Gradually bend your knees more as you twist which will lower your body further. Hold this position for a few beats, then rise back up by raising your knees to the starting position. Both the dropping and rising part of the move should be slow and steady.

, With the normal twist, both feet move in synchronized harmony. Instead, hold one foot still while twisting the heel of your other foot as your hips shift from side to side.


The leg of the stationary foot will not rock from side to side, but the knee will bend forward and back in response to your body movement.

, As you shift your weight to one side, bend the leg of your other side at the knee and lift it up. Hold it up for the entire beat and gradually lower it back down as you shift your weight back to that side.


Continue twisting the leg you lift as you hold it up. In doing so, your leg will usually kick back or to the side in response to the overall movement.

, You can throw a little flair into the dance by raising your arms above your head and waving them to the beat. You do not need to keep your arms above your head the entire time. Instead, mix things up by doing this for part of the dance and keeping your arms in the standard bent position for the rest of the dance.

, For a different type of arm movement, keep your arms bent at the elbows and swing the forearm portion in a circular motion in front of your body. Keep your arms in sync with each other as you swing them.


This move was first made popular by the ""peppermint twist."", Consider clapping to the beat as you twist the rest of your body. This is one of the easier ways to make the dance your own, and it can be a good move to use if you are still new to the dance. Clapping can help enact the beat of the twist.


This is another move first exemplified in the “peppermint twist” version of the dance.
Mix up your clapping to make it more interesting. On one beat, clap once; on the next, clap twice. Alternate back and forth between one clap and two, maintaining this pattern for the duration of the song.

, The usual twist requires you to keep your body low. If you want to really stand out, gradually rise up from your low position and give a quick jump straight up on one beat. Afterward, shift your body back down to its usual position.

Check for guidelines from your instructors.,
Choose comfortable clothes for dance class.,
Find the right materials.,
Wear layers for warming up.,
Consider wearing tights.,
Choose jazz dance shoes or sneakers.,
Use hair ties.,
Wear sweatbands.,
Don’t wear extra accessories.",How to Dress for a Jazz Dance Class," Visit the website of the school, organization or instructor. Look for dress code instructions – many companies provide such guides online. If not, contact your instructor directly.


Try asking, “Is there a list of requirements for dance attire?”
Some classes may require your attire to be modest. For example, they may prohibit certain clothing items, such as cut-off shorts.;
, Select pieces that aren’t too baggy or too tight. Practice full ranges of motion in them to make sure your pieces don’t restrict or distract you.Measure your body accurately and consult with a sizing chart if you’re purchasing clothing online.Clothing should not be so tight that it deters you from any sort of movement.
Clothing should not be so loose that it can tangle or get in your way. For example, avoid wearing an oversized t-shirt.
For instance, try wearing jogging pants with a fitted shirt or vest.

, Choose fabrics that are stretchable and soft. Avoid material that is too thin and flimsy, or the cheapest fabrics which won’t stand up well to wear and tear. Look for clothing that can go in the washer and dryer.Fabric should be somewhat thick but still stretchy. Try Lycra, jersey, cotton or silk.
Remember that you’ll be washing your dance clothing often.
For example, try a leotard with jazz pants.

, Bring a warmup sweater and leg warmers. Layer your clothing pieces to start out, and remove a layer after you’ve warmed up.


For example, wear one or more fitted tops and a warmup sweater. Wear pants or leg warmers with shorts, if allowed.
Note that some dance classes will allow you to wear leg warmers or other layered pieces during the warmup portion only.

, Look for tights at your local dance boutique. Try on different tights, if possible. Move around in them and do stretches; see which ones feel the most comfortable for you.


There are many types of dance tights, such as footed, convertible, stirrup, footless and more.Tights, particularly compression tights, may assist in warming up, jumping power, injury prevention and recovery., Opt for a breathable fabric, such as canvas or leather. Look for rubber soles with traction throughout, and small heels. Pick shoes that fill well – it’s better for them to be snug than too loose.Consider how easy the shoes will be for you to clean before purchasing them.Depending on your dress policy, you might have to wear jazz shoes.
Look for slip-on shoes rather than lace-up. You don’t want to be tripping on your laces!
Don’t practice dance with bare feet. You’ll be jumping and stamping and need to protect your arches., Pull your hair back into a bun or ponytail, if your hair is long, to keep it out of your face. Wear a headband if you have shorter hair in the front. Add pins or clips for stubborn layers or fly-aways.


Jazz dance classes often require students to have their hair properly pulled back and secured.

, Choose sweat headbands and/or arm sweatbands. Look for soft, thick, stretchy material. Use your sweatband to quickly wipe away sweat as needed.


For example, try a cotton/elastine blend.
Make sure headbands are permitted in your dance class.
Consider bringing a small towel with you as well.

, Avoid wearing any jewelry to dance class. Don’t wear everyday accessories that can get in your way during practice. Limit your attire to dancewear.


For example, don’t wear a watch, fashion spectacles, or a scarf during class.

, An easy way to begin momentum for a wave is by having a group of willing participants. The wave is completed smoother when more audience members know about the wave. Make a plan with your group to talk to the surrounding people in the stands.


Talk to a group of friends you're planning to go with.

, To help inform the people in your section, you’ll need to project your voice. Consider using a megaphone so you don’t have to strain your voice., The best ways to start a wave is to stand in a visible spot in front of your section. From this front spot, you can coordinate with the audience members in your section.


It helps your chances of reaching more members, if you coordinate with the audience with a group., Now it is time to countdown to the audience. You need to tell the audience, “do the wave in 3-2-1.” After counting down throw your hands up. If you have a group helping you, other people could be in the aisles. Once you start counting down make sure your group is synchronized.

, Even after organizing, it can take a few tries to get a successful wave started. Stay in front of the audience and try again. Wait about a minute until trying again. If you’ve tried three or more times, the crowd might not be into it.


When your team is performing poorly or there is low morale, it can be hard to start a successful wave."

Choose the music.,
Position your arms.,
Relax your shoulders.,
Start the pulse.,
Move the pulse.,
Continue moving the wave.,
Bring your arm to equilibrium.,
Practice the movement.",How to Do the Wave2," The wave is a classic hip hop dance move originated with B-Boys and break dancing. You don’t need to listen to early hip-hop to do the wave, but it doesn’t hurt. If you want to listen to the authentic stuff, put on Funk You Up by The Sequence.


You could also listen to contemporary rap or anything that has a groovy beat.

, Hold your arms out so you’re making a “T” shape with your body.Be sure that you stay loose while extending your arms. Dancing is all about staying loose.

, While in the “T” position, attempt to relax your shoulders. Don’t drop your arms, but try to rest the shoulder muscles. Your arms should be able to still hold with relaxed shoulders.

, Start with your right arm and flop it down so that your fingers point to the floor while your elbow points up. You could also begin by pointing your hand up and your elbow down.


Feel free to start with your left arm, if that feels more comfortable.

, Imagine the crest or trough of the wave must move through your arms.Move the wave through your shoulders. The key is for one shoulder to move up and have the other down. Then, as you move the wave you will switch shoulders.


The shoulder that was down will go up and the one up will move down., Once the wave passes through your shoulders, it must enter through your other arm. Once the shoulder is up, move the elbow down and move the wave into your hand. When the wave is in your hand, your hand is up while your elbow is down.

, Once you’ve sent the wave through one arm, it must return to the “T” shape. Only keep your arm in position until the wave comes back to this arm.

, Practice sending the wave to both sides and then reverse the process. You may need to practice a few times before you can send the wave through your arms and reverse.The key is to move with the music. The aforementioned song is slow enough that you can practice each piece of the wave.

Memorize monologues.,
Get headshots.,
Make a demo reel.,
Find auditions.,
Provide all requested materials to the casting director.,
Plan to tailor your performance for each audition.,
Get ready to do a cold read.",How to Audition for a Movie Role1," At most movie auditions, you will be asked to perform a monologue or two. This is your chance to display your flexibility an range as an actor. Choose monologues that fit your personality and acting style. Having at least 3 memorized at any given time will keep you prepared for potential casting calls; you never know when one might crop up.


Choose 3-4 monologues that are each distinct. Have a dramatic monologue, a comedic monologue, and so on. You'll want to show the casting director that you're capable of capturing more than one type of emotion or style.
Look through monologue books for unique monologues that you haven't heard before. Casting directors will be tired of hearing the same old choices hundreds of times.
Practice your monologues often, so you aren't rusty if you need to perform last minute.
Time your monologues and make sure they're all 2 minutes or less. Auditions are timed, and you'll get cut off if you go beyond 2 minutes or so.;
, Headshots are often what get you in the door at a casting call. Hire a photographer with plenty of experience making headshots, which are quite different from regular portraits. Headshots are designed to display your personality type and highlight the physical features that make you unique.


Ask people you know in your industry for recommendations. Headshot photographers can be quite expensive, so make sure you have the rate nailed down before you go in for a shoot.
When you're researching what photography studio to use, ask if a makeup artist will be available to work with you throughout the shoot. If not, it might be worth paying extra to hire someone to keep you looking fresh while your pictures are being taken.

, A demo reel is a compilation of clips from other film projects you have done. The clips should be careful selections from scenes that display your acting talent to best effect. You can use video editing software to make your own demo reel, or hire a video editor to create a professionally-polished reel. The entire reel should be no longer than 2-3 minutes.


The reel should be as easy to view as possible. Some casting directors will ask you to send an electronic file via email, while others will ask for a hard copy on DVD. Have your reel available in both formats.
If you've never been in a movie before, include clips from a play you've been in that was filmed. You can also include clips from student films.
In recent years some casting directors have been asking for clips that cater to the project at hand. For example, if you're auditioning to play a football team captain, try to send a clip that shows you playing a similar character.
Don't start your reel with an introduction or montage. It should begin with your name, then launch directly into the first scene.Don't save the best for last. Casting directors have a lot of reels to review. If yours doesn't start out with your strongest scenes, chances are they'll skip to the next person's reel.

, The easiest way to find auditions in your area is to do an online search. Backstage.comhas a comprehensive listing of auditions in various cities. You can also check the classifieds section in your local newspaper or check with classifieds on university websites for casting calls for student films.


New York City and Los Angeles have the highest concentration of casting calls, since both cities are big into the movie business. However, many smaller cities and towns have a thriving film community, and you're sure to find opportunities in your area if you know where to look. Check out arts blogs, alternative weekly newspapers, and other arts publications to find more information.

, You may be asked for a resume and cover letter in addition to your headshots and demo reel. You may be asked to bring these materials with you to the casting call or submit them beforehand. Either way, make sure the materials are formatted according to the casting director's specifications, and don't leave anything out. Making things less convenient for the casting director will definitely hurt your chances.

, You have your monologues ready to perform at any time, but you shouldn't treat each audition the same way. Think about the part for which you're auditioning and choose the monologues that best fit the role. If possible, memorize a new one before audition day arrives.


You should dress appropriately for the part as well. Don't arrive in full costume, but make yourself look like a believable version of the character you'll be playing. If you're auditioning to be a classy CEO businesswoman, don't show up in jeans and tennis shoes.

, In addition to performing one of your monologues, you'll probably also be asked to read a section of the script without getting the chance to look at it beforehand. Most casting calls include a description of the characters, so hopefully you'll already have a feel for how to get into character.

Make a confident first impression.,
Walk to the mark.,
Master your slate.",How to Audition for a Movie Role2," When you walk into the room, make eye contact with the casting director and other auditors. Have good posture, and don't walk in too quickly or come in out of breath. From the moment you walk into the room, you'll be judged for your demeanor and presence, so make sure you take a deep breath and collect yourself instead of rushing into the room. You must appear relaxed and confident.

, The mark, usually a simple ""x"" on the floor made with tape, is the spot where you'll begin acting for the audition. It's usually placed several feet in front of where the casting director and auditors are sitting so they can have the best possible view of your audition.You don't have to feel anchored to the mark throughout the course of your audition; it's just a starting place. You should utilize the space in a way that makes sense for the role you're playing.

, A slate is your one-sentence introduction that you make just before you begin your monologue. When you reach the mark, turn to the casting director, make eye contact, and give your name and a short description of what you're about to do. For example: ""Good evening. I'm Felicia Woods, and this piece is from the second act of Hamlet.""


Don't spend too much time talking before you perform. Most auditions are timed, and the clock starts ticking as soon as you walk in. You want to maximize your performance time.
Don't ask the casting director and auditors their names, and don't exchange pleasantries beyond saying ""good evening"" or the like. Again, you don't have time for it."
"
Act as much as possible.,
Hone various skills and talents.,
Consider finding a talent agent.,
Get a SAG-AFTRA card.",How to Audition for a Movie Role3," Taking classes and practicing your craft as often as possible will increase the chances that you'll impress a casting director. Take feedback from auditions into account and work as hard as you can to improve, then try again. It might take dozens of auditions before you land a role, but every time you act in front of a casting director, you're getting valuable practice.

, You can single yourself out from the other actors by demonstrating your other talents if they are relevant for the role. Knowing how to sing, dance, play an instrument, play a sport, and so on can give you an edge. Don't be afraid to break into song during an audition if you think it will help your chances.

, A talent agent would be responsible for finding roles suitable for your style and experience level, eliminating the need for you to track down roles on your own. Casting directors often send talent agents descriptions of the type of actor they're looking for, and talent agents then notify the casting directors if they're representing someone who would be a good fit. Working with a talent agent is a good way to get an ""in"" after you've gotten some experience under your belt.


If you go this route, be sure you're working with an experienced, licensed agent. Some people pose as talent agents to prey on vulnerable young actors. You can expect to pay your agent 10% of your earnings.
You can find an agent by attending a casting workshop, during which you would audition in front of both agents and casting directors. Do an online search for workshops in your area.
The Call Sheet is a list of talent agents of good repute. Check out the list and contact agents directly., Becoming a member of SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors' labor union, can give you access to higher paying and higher profile work. It also provides health insurance and ensures your work isn't used illegally."

Pronounce each syllable separately.,
Blend two vowels together.,
Pronounce the letter T correctly.,
Pronounce “wh” as a “f” sound.,
Finish off the song properly.,
Listen to an audio Maori pronunciation guide.",How to Do the Haka1," The Maori language, spoken by indigenous people of New Zealand, has vowels with long and short sounds (such as ay and ah for the letter A). Each phrase, such as “ka ma - te,” is pronounced separately.There is a very short stop between each syllable, with a few exceptions. The resulting sounds in a Haka will be staccato and fierce.;
, Vowel combinations, such as “ao” or “ua,” are pronounced by gliding them together (such as “ay-o” and “oo-ah”).There isn’t a brief stop or breath between these vowel sets, also known as diphthongs. Instead, they are a smooth combination sound.

, The letter T is pronounced like an English T when it is followed by the vowels A, E or O. It carries a slight “s” sound when the T is followed by an I or U.The Haka has both of these instances:


For example, in “Tenei te tangata,” the T will sound like an English T.
For example, in the line, “Nana nei I tiki mai,” the T letters followed by I will have a slight “s” sound accompanying the T.

, The last line of the Haka starts with “whiti te ra.” Pronounce the “whi” as a “fi.”, The last syllable of the song is “Hi!” This is pronounced as “he” with a quick breath, rather than a drawn out “high.”Push the breath out of your lungs by tightening your stomach muscles.

, Listening to proper pronunciation can help you practice your language skills. There are a number of audio pronunciation guides available online. Search for “Maori pronunciation” in a search engine.

Instead, the leader will shout out some of the lines, giving direction to the group. The leader reminds the group how to conduct themselves during the Haka. A Haka leader should have a strong, fierce voice and speak clearly and forcefully.This leader may be the leader of your sports team or group.

, Often, sports teams perform the Haka together before beginning a match. There is not a particular number of people you need to perform the Haka, but if the group is larger, then the effect of the Haka is more intimidating and impressive.

, If you want to perform a Haka with your sports team before a match, make sure you have alerted the game’s officials and the other team.


If your opponent is the one performing the Haka, watch respectfully with your team.

, The Haka will look fiercer if your group stands in a formation of some sort, as though you are going to set off into organized battle. Walk from a bunched group into a few lines of people. Give yourself lots of arm room, since you’ll be swinging your arms around.

Learn the Ka Mate Haka.",How to Do the Haka3," The words of the warm-up chant are typically shouted by the leader. They are intended to inspire the group and to warn the opponent that the dance is starting. This part of the chant also gets the group in proper body position. The five lines of the chant are (with their English translation, which is not spoken):Ringa pakia! (Slap the hands against the thighs)
Uma tiraha! (Puff out the chest)
Turi whatia! (Bend the knees)
Hope whai ake! (Let the hip follow)
Waewae takahia kia kino! (Stamp the feet as hard as you can)

, Haka chants have several variations. The Kapa O‘Pango Haka was composed in 2005 as a special Haka for the All Blacks the New Zealand national rugby team.It is often performed by the All Blacks instead of the Ka Mate Haka, and specifically references the All Blacks.Kapa o pango kia whakawhenua au i ahau! (Let me become one with the land)
Hi aue, hi! Ko Aotearoa e ngunguru nei! (This is our land that rumbles)
Au, au, aue ha! (And it’s my time! It’s my moment!)
Ko Kapa o Pango e ngunguru nei! (This defines us as the All Blacks)

Kapa o Pango, aue hi! (All Blacks!)
Ponga ra! (Silver fern!)
Kapa o Pango, aue hi, ha! (All Blacks!)

, The Ka Mate version, a war dance, is another Haka performed by the All Blacks. It was originally composed by Te Rauparaha, a Maori war leader, around 1820.The chant is shouted in an aggressive, fierce voice.


Ka mate! Ka mate! (It is death!, It is death!)

If you are the leader, quiver your hands and fingers as you shout at your group. If you are part of the group, you can quiver your hands and fingers when your hands are in a stationary position at the beginning of the Haka.


If you are part of the group, keep your hands in fists for most of the motions.

, The pukana is the glaring, wild-eyed look that the performers have on their faces throughout the Haka. For men, the pukana is a facial expression intended to intimidate and scare the enemy. For women, the pukana is a facial expression intended to express sexuality.To show pukana, open your eyes really wide and hold your head up high. Glare and stare at your opponent while raising your eyebrows.

Learn the history of the Haka.,
Perform the Haka in the appropriate context.,
Perform the Haka in a respectful way.",How to Do the Haka6," Hakas are a traditional cultural expression of the Maori people to signal impending war, peacetime, and life changes.Hakas have also been performed by the New Zealand national rugby team since the late 1800s, so its inclusion at rugby matches also has a rich history., The Haka is considered precious and nearly sacred, an integral part of Maori culture. It has been performed by many different kinds of groups around the world, which has brought Hakas into popular culture. Performing a Haka in a commercial way, such as for an advertisement, is probably not appropriate unless you are Maori.


There is a legislative bill in New Zealand debating whether the Maori can essentially trademark the Ka Mate Haka, restricting it from commercial use., Don’t make a mockery of the Haka by over-exaggerating movements. Be culturally sensitive to the Haka and its meaning for the Maori culture. If you are not Maori, consider whether the Haka is the best choice for your team or group as a form of expression.

Read the entire script 2-3 times.,
Ask and answer several key questions about your character.,
Know your character's defining desire.,
Practice your lines until they become second nature.,
Talk to the director about their vision for the character.,
Put yourself in the shoes of your character.",How to Be a Good Actor or Actress1," You need to know the entire play/movies or episode well, not just your character. Actors exist to drive forward the larger theme and plot of a movie, play or TV show. If you don't understand the larger themes and ideas of the script then your performance will seem out of place. When reading the script, ask yourself what the main theme of the work is. How does your character fit into the story?


Once you're got a grasp on the full story, turn to your parts and read them an extra 1-2 times. Now, focus on your character's role and lines.;
, To really get into your character, you need to dive past what is on the page and start thinking about what makes your character tick. All of this might not make it to the screen/stage, but these little facts will help you fully portray the character and can lead to important discoveries about how you'll play the role. When coming up with ""answers,"" trust your gut, or ask the director or writer for help.


Who am I?
Where am I from?
Why am I here?, All characters, in almost all stories, want something. This is the basis of plot. The desire can be to save the world, to get a date, or simply to grab a bite to eat. But you need to know this desire, and why your character has it, in order to accurately portray them. All of your character's actions will stem in some way from this desire. It is what drives and fuels them.


A character's desires can change, and you need to note when this happens. It is almost always a major scene or moment to portray.
As an exercise, try and pick out the desires of your favorite characters/actors. In There Will Be Blood, for example, the main character is completely driven by the need to find more oil. Every action, look, and emotion springs from this unending, passionate greed, and you can see it on Daniel Day-Lewis's face each scene., You shouldn't ever have to stop and think about what you're about to say. You should be more concerned with how you're saying it. The only way to get to this point is to practice your lines over and over again, doing your best to recite them without consulting the script. Get a friend to play the rest of the parts so that you can realistically bounce the conversation back and forth.


Experiment with the lines as you read. Try them multiple ways, with different inflections or emphasis, and see how it affects your character.
Recording yourself and watching it later can help you see small mistakes, or hear new ways to deliver the lines.
Focus on getting the lines down first before worrying about perfecting the lines. You want to be able to recite the words now, then make them perfect later.

, If you've already got the role, sit down with the director to see if there is any specific direction they want to go with things. Briefly let them know your ideas about the character and how you see them contributing to the themes in the project, then listen to their ideas as well. Remember that you are there to serve the project as a whole, not just yourself. You need to be able to take constructive criticism and ideas gracefully.


If you don't have the role yet, and are going to an audition, pick a direction for the character and stick with it. Don't try and give people what they want to hear. Instead, read the notes and prepare the lines in the way that feels natural to you., You can not adequately represent a character unless you can get inside their head. Even though your words are scripted out, your actions and blocking aren't always written in stone. In addition, knowing your character well will help you improvise should someone forget their lines. Preparing for a role is the process of getting into your character's head, embodying them the best you can.


Method acting is when an actor refuses to break character on set. In between takes, they stay in the role, trying to fully inhabit the character so that they are always perfect when playing the role on camera.
Find the parts of the role that ring true for you. Have you felt the sorts of emotions your character is going through? Do you know a little bit about the struggle? Find ways to channel your emotions into your character's lines for the best results.

"
Commit to your roles.,
Learn to react.,
Think about a consistent posture.,
Use your pace and volume to dictate the energy of a scene.,
Play with the emphasis in your lines.,
Respect the script.,
Keep your blocking consistent.,
Ignore the camera or audience.",How to Be a Good Actor or Actress2," It is not your job, as an actor, to rewrite the script so that you are ""more likeable,"" nor is it your job to judge the writing or character and play a version of yourself instead. It is your job to portray a character that could believably inhabit the world of the movie, play, or TV show. Just like the writer, director, camera person, etc, you need to work as part of a larger, consistent group to make a great show.


Don't be embarrassed by something your character is doing, because it is ultimately just acting. If you hold back on a gross, violent, sexual, or emotionally difficult scene you only end up alienating the audience and coming across as ""unrealistic.""
All the best actors commit fully to their roles. Ever wonder why Tom Cruise is still an action star? It's because he never winks, jokes, or sleepwalks his way through the script. He always has high-energy and full commitment, even in bizarre or comical situations.
Committing to a role means doing whatever it takes to portray your character realistically, not doing what makes you, the actor, look the best.

, While not everyone agrees that acting is reacting, it is still an important thing to consider when you're learning about acting. This means that you have to work on your responsiveness to any given acting situation. Really focus in on the other actor's lines, listening to them intently like you would any other person's conversation in ""real life."" You want to respond honestly, in the voice of your character, even if you are not the main attraction of the scene.


Keep yourself in the moment. Don't try to start thinking ahead to the next scene, or agonizing about whether you said your lines appropriately in the previous scene.
For a humorous example, watch Charlie Day in the show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Even when he is not speaking, his eyebrows, eyes, and fingers are darting around. He fully commits to his character's wild, unpredictable energy.

, It's important to remember that something as small as posture can make a big difference. Not only does it make you look more confident, it helps you further inhabit the life of the character. If your character is weak or meager, hunch your shoulders and sink away from the others. If they are heroic, stand tall with your chest and head held high.

, When reciting lines it's tempting to blaze through them as fast as you can. But this is a surefire way to lose the nuance of your role. Instead, let your pacing and volume mimic your character's internal state.


Nervous or scared characters often talk quickly, rushing the words out.
Angry characters will raise their voice, and may slow down their speech (to make a point) or speed it up (when overflowing with anger).
Happy/excited characters tend to speak with an even volume, or raise volume as the speech goes on. They talk quickly.
A variety of pacing and volume, depending on the scene, is a great way to show characters changing or reacting to certain events., Think about the subtext of every line, and emphasize accordingly. Emphasis the lined is stressed. Think of it as the most important word or phrase of the sentence. It may not sound important, but emphasis can have a huge role in anything you say. ""I love you"" has a different connotation than ""I love you,"" for example.


This is another place where famous actors can help you practice. Research an old script online for a movie you haven't seen, then pick a character and try out a couple of line readings. When you watch the movie, compare how the actor chose to deliver the lines. There is no wrong answer here, but this can help you notice the subtleties of emphasis., Unless given permission to do so, or briefly improvising a word or two, stick to the script as much as possible. You may not be sure if there is a call-back to another line or scene, or if a director likes the exact line reading for some reason. When in doubt, always obey the script. Someone will tell you if they want you to improvise or deviate into something different., Blocking is where you move and stand in a scene. Once you've decided on blocking with the director, don't change it. Work on hitting the exact same blocking each take, rehearsal, or scene. This allows continuity, and helps the rest of the cast and crew plan their own jobs.


This is especially crucial for filmed projects, as identical blocking allows an editor to cut between different takes without the audience noticing.

, Noticing, reacting to, or acknowledging the audience is the quickest way to fall out of character. In most cases, characters do not know that they are in a play or movie, and you shouldn't either. This comes with practice, but a good way to get ready is to simply get in front of a camera. When you notice it, or feel like you're being watched, don't react to the feeling.


Many experienced casts and crews won't make eye contact with you while acting, knowing that is is a natural human tendency to make eye contact back. Try and help your fellow actors by doing the same while they work and you're taking a break.
Be aware of things that you do when you're nervous. Avoid playing with your hair, hiding your hands in your sleeves, or shuffling your feet. Instead, deal with your nerves by taking a deep breath and drinking some water.

Research human behavior through conversations and books.,
Watch and rewatch actors you admire.,
Go to acting classes.,
Take improv classes.,
Practice ""cold readings"" to ace your auditions.",How to Be a Good Actor or Actress3," To play a diverse array of people, you need to know a diverse array of people. When you meet people, do your best to be quiet and listen. Ask them about their lives and stories, note how they talk and any slang they use, and let yourself be a sponge. Reading helps you see these concepts at work. Moreover, reading actually activates the same part of your brain as acting does.


You should also do specific research for your part. If it is based on a specific person or time period, find out as much as you can. These little facts will work their way into your performance, even if only unconsciously., When you're watching someone act, let the scene simply wash over you the first time, watching like you would watch any other movie. Then replay the scene, paying specific attention to each actor separately. What do they do when they aren't talking? How do they deliver their lines? What is their body positioning and posture like? What movements do they use to sell their lines?


Would you read the same lines differently? If so, how?
Classic plays, like Shakespeare, are a great way to see the artistry of acting. YouTube, for example, 5 different actors delivering the same monologue from Hamlet. How do they all differ? What artistic choices is each actor making to make the character unique?, These classes often end in a production or performance, and are a great way to practice acting in a low-pressure environment. Take note not only of the teacher, but the other students. What can you learn from them? How would you improve their line readings, and would you make any different character choices? Make friends with your fellow actors, and talk to them from time to ask them for advice or tips on your performance.


You never know when a fellow actor will make it bi, and could potentially help you get a role. Be kind and friendly to everyone in class-- it will pay dividends later.

, Improvisation is the art of acting in the present, letting your character take over the action and react accordingly. Improv skills will help your characters seem natural, like they are reacting to the events on the screen in real time and not reading off a page. There are many improvisation classes in urban and semi-urban areas, and many acting classes feature a small amount of improv training.Improv games, like acting out suggestions from friends, acting with weird props, or acting short scenes with a friend, are great ways to practice acting anywhere.

, A cold read is when you're handed a script and asked to act it out on the spot. Sometimes you get 1-2 minutes to look it over, and sometimes you need to just launch into it. While this is scary, it is also very easy to practice. Buy a book of monologues, grab passages from a book, or even pick up a dramatic newspaper story and read it out loud. You can also read it once, silently, then take 20-30 seconds to choose a direction for the piece before beginning.


This is also a good warm-up exercise, helping you prepare your mind and body for acting.

Take it slow.",How to Do the Single Ladies Dance," Put your right hand on your hip, and hold your left arm out to the side, bent at the elbow and the wrist. Your left arm should look a little like the spout of a teapot.Keep your body loose and relaxed, especially the wrists.;
, As you shift your body to the right, push your right shoulder forward a little bit. At the same time, brush the air with your left hand.Shift your body back to the left on the second count. When you shift to the left, drop your left arm to your side., Count the beat using a ""1, and, 2, and, 3, and, 4, and..."" pattern. Dividing the beat like this will help you find your rhythm. It will be much easier to know what move lands on what count.On every odd beat you should be on your right, and on every even beat you should be on your left. Shift on the balls of your feet and move your hips to the beat.
Brush with your left hand on ""1"" and ""5."" When you aren't brushing with your left hand, keep your arm relaxed and at your side., The second eight counts of the dance are almost exactly the same as the first eight counts. The only difference is that the second time through, you'll end the sequence with a kick.The set up for the kick starts on ""3"" with your right hip out, and your left arm bent at the elbow and wrist. Instead of shifting back to the left, roll your upper body and plant your right foot behind you on ""4.""When you plant your right foot behind you, you're setting up for what's known as a ""ball change."" You're going to shift your weight by taking two small steps. As soon as you plant your right foot, quickly take a small step forward with your left foot. Transfer your weight to your left foot and kick out with your right on ""6"". As you kick out, throw your hands up in the air. Bring your right foot down, place your hands on your hips, and take a small step forward with your left foot. Keep a slight bend in your left knee., Keeping your hands on your hips, and your left leg slightly bent, shake your hips to the beat. Start the hip shake when Beyoncé starts to sing the line ""Up in the club...""The rhythm for the hip shake is ""1, 2, 3, and 4,"" with a pause between ""1"" and ""2."" Shake your hips on all three counts for ""3, and 4."", Continuing from the hip shake, bend your left leg in on the count of ""5,"" and back out on ""6."" When you bend your leg in, point your knee to the right of your body.On the count of ""7"" kick your left leg out in front of you, and then bring it back down on the count of ""8."", As soon as you finish the kick, take a step with your right foot and twist your body to the right. Take another step with your left leg, and put your left arm up, as you did in the beginning of the dance.Dip your body. When Beyoncé sings ""Dip,"" bend down at the waist. Keep your legs in the same position and dip down. On the next count, stand back up, leading with your head., When you come back up from the dip, turn around, and walk in a large circle until you are back where you started. Think of the walk as more of a strut. Keep your hands on your hips with your elbows pointed back.When you return the starting position, kick out with your left leg, and spin around to the back. Throw your hands in the air and shake your hips to the beat.
The choreography at this point in the dance is full of variations on the hip shake from earlier in the dance. Play around with various moves and postures until you find what works for you.

, The next big part of the ""Single Ladies"" dance is the iconic pump walk. To do the pump walk, face the left and put your left hand out in front of you. Your left hand should be in the same ""teapot"" pose as it was in the beginning of the dance.Take a few steps to beat and then turn around. Facing your right, put your arms in front of you and point them down towards the ground. As you step, thrust them back and forth to the beat., A lot of the moves in ""Single Ladies"" are a variation of the basic moves at the beginning of the song. The choreography for the song is based on a style of dancing known as ""J-Sette.""""Single Ladies"" also incorporates a lot of movements found in other Hip Hop dances. Get familiar with these movements and add them to your routine.
Try not to be stiff when you're dancing. The more you can relax and move your arms and head, the better. Use your whole body when you dance.

, Even if you don't know the entire routine by heart, you can still look good while dancing. Listen for the beat and move in sync with the music., Beyoncé has attitude in almost every one of her dance routines. When you dance to ""Single Ladies,"" keep your movements feminine and strong. Use your shoulders, your hips, and your arms in everything you do.Don't forget to use your face as well. You can give sexy looks when you come back from the dips, or when you're walking to the beat.

, A lot of these dance moves are complex and involve doing several things at once. You might find that you have the footwork down, but are struggling to get your shoulders in the right place. Take your time and break down each movement.If you get stuck on a move, start over. It may help to follow along with the video. You can find slowed down versions of the video online that may help you see exactly what Beyoncé is doing.

Consider links to others.",How to Be a Better Stage Actor," Great actors spend their entire careers learning to relax the muscles in their face and body at will. Tension is very obvious when you are on stage. Your voice will sound thin and wavering, and your movements will be jerky and unattractive. To avoid these stiff and nervous displays when you're acting, it is essential to remain as relaxed as possible. Even a scene involving high drama calls for measured and calm concentration from the actor. So, act dramatic, but be calm inside, and don't work yourself up.

, It could be another actor, a prop, etc. Keep yourself in the moment and never stare off into space. It is obvious to the audience if you are spacing out, and it is very distracting. Keeping in the moment enables you to remain in character and enhances the believability of the role and the play itself. In real life, we tend to look at the eyes of the people we're speaking with (or listening to), so doing that on stage will appear quite natural., Just look at the back of the theater or your focus point if you are tense. Looking into the eyes of your fellow actors can be reassuring and let you feel not so ""alone"" on stage.

, Forget that you are pretending, and try to become the character you are playing. Envision how that person reacts to life, how that person dresses, walks, thinks and converses with others. Don't be afraid to act like someone else. Draw on these visualizations when portraying the character. Always stay in that state of mind when acting. If you only pretend to be sad, it's an effort; if you are sad, the result is more authentic. Don't act the character, be the character.

, While acting, you need to enunciate your words carefully (speak clearly) and project your voice farther than normal (which is not the same thing as shouting), because there are people a good distance away who are trying to understand what you're saying. All the emotions on your face should be formed in a more intense manner (but remember to stay relaxed). If you feel like you're over-acting, then you're probably acting just enough. Eyes, smile, facial expressions, gestures, etc. need to be more expansive and dramatic than you would ever make them in real life. This is often confused with exaggeration, but it really isn't. Exaggeration means making your actions and speech ""bigger."" Instead, you want better.

It's different if you're acting in front of a camera. Here you must be more subtle, as in real life. A camera picks up subtleties very easily. Broad and exaggerated movements suitable for stage acting often look ""hammed up"" on film.







, If you're performing for an audience (either live or on film), do everything you can to make the audience believe the character you're portraying. If the script says that someone is talking too much, then show a look of annoyance on your face, and perhaps accompany that with impatient tapping of your foot. If you're supposed to be near tears, blink hard, look downwards, fiddle with your clothes, and try to stare without blinking until your eyes water. Little actions are noticeable, including very expressive facial features. Employ as many of your senses as possible, such as playing music, putting on make-up, turning on some lights; anything that can make the room seem happy or sad to fit the character's mood that you are trying to display. This includes modifying your voice, which can be done by spending time with people who have an accent you want to mimic, learning a new dialect, or even getting a voice coach. There are also recordings and books to help you master an accent.

, Invest in a cheap recorder (tape, CD, flash drive). Set the recorder at a distance (start with 20 feet -- 6 meters), press record, back away, and speak a simple sentence, such as ""My shirt is blue and my eyes are, too."" Try other sentences, too. (""How now brown cow"" is a famous one). Listen to how you sound in the recording. Challenge yourself by backing farther away and repeating the words. You'll have to project your voice more each time in order to be heard clearly on the recording.

The difference between ""projecting"" and ""shouting"" is a subtle one. Essentially, projecting means to speak loudly while sounding ""normal."" In shouting, your tone of voice changes to something more strident. In projecting, you sound like you're just talking, but you can be heard at a distance.







, Breathe and alliterate. Do numerous vocal warm ups to ensure that you do not strain your vocal cords. Concentrate on enunciating your words so that your voice comes across clearly. Record yourself saying a complex sentence such as, ""Why, oh why haven't you seen those rambunctious twins, Jill and Bill?"". Try speaking this with and without emotion. Then replay the recording, listening for sounds you can enunciate more clearly. Ee-NUNN-see-ate eh-ver-ee sill-uh-bull.

Remember, however, that when you actually act, you can't do this! It's just an exercise that should be done in front of a mirror for practice. Do it enough, though, and you'll find yourself doing it automatically on stage.







, Facial expressions should be combined with simultaneous vocal inflections. Say a simple ""Oh!"" in front of a mirror. Notice both your face and your voice. Alternately portray sadness, awe, anger, fear, shock, excitement, and any other emotion you can think of.

,


Make copies of your lines. Write or print them out, so that you can leave copies everywhere you're likely to see them. Keep a copy in your bag, your desk drawer, next to your bed, in the bathroom, at the kitchen table, on the wall, in front of a favorite window.
Read your lines at every opportunity -- before you go to bed, when you wake up in the morning, waiting for a bus, cooking dinner. Recite the lines over and over, remembering to include intonation and facial expressions so that these become second nature when you perform them on stage.
If you have a long passage, say the first line over and over until you are comfortable with your intonation and phrasing. Then practice the first two lines. Work repeatedly on those lines until you are ready to add the next one. And so on. (Or you can work backwards, starting with the last line, then the last two lines, etc.) Once you are comfortable with the whole passage, explore its meaning, and refine your delivery to highlight it.

, Get to know a diverse group of people. You can't possibly act like someone you've never observed. Talk to people you'd normally not think of spending time with. Think of it as research for future roles.

, It is not cheating or copying to learn from others. Watch other actors and see what they do with the parts they're given. You will learn a lot. You'll see things they do that you might incorporate into your own acting style. Just do it in a way that's unique to you. You'll develop ideas for overcoming aspects of acting that you might be finding strange or difficult. Don't be shy about asking other actors for help. Most will be more than happy to offer you advice.

, If you're less than comfortable performing before a live audience, trick yourself. When the house lights go out and the stage lights go on, you won't be able to see the audience, except for the first row or two. Just pretend you're acting for a few friends.

, Whether it be a live audience, a camera, or a close friend or relative, pretend there's a wall between you and the audience. They call this ""the fourth wall."" You're no longer on a stage or a set, you're in your private world, and the audience doesn't exist. Just remember never to turn your back on the audience.

Some plays require you to speak directly to the audience. This is called 'breaking the fourth wall."" If you are required to do this, pretend you're merely looking at them but speaking to your fellow actors on stage. It may also help to look above the audience.

, What are the cultural implications of this name? Does it suggest a specific type of acting? Does it lend a broader context to the role?


As an example, the name might suggest a kind of animal. Think about that animal, how it moves, how it feeds itself. Perhaps you could develop a characteristic action, gesture or attitude emblematic of such a creature. The best actors are good at creating unusual or attention-worthy moments.;
, Would the person like to be an astronaut? An explorer? A schoolteacher?

, Take cues from the script and construct an intellectual and emotional portrait of the person you're playing. The character will stand out with this preparation. What traits might fit? Think about clothing, grooming, posture, and vocal habits.

, If s/he lives in poverty, is s/he moving into a better situation and resolving conflict, or will this character remain a poor example for others?


What is good, bad or ugly about this character? How is that expressed in choice of clothing, grooming or other personal style?
What would the character say, think or dwell on? What would never be spoken?
What little things lift or oppress the character's soul? Does s/he have a favorite color, decorative style, or unique habit?

, How important are the character's relationships to other people (including the audience)? If they're strong, why is this the case? If not, how do the character's behavior and attitude impact the play? What subtle or natural behaviors appeal to the audience or place the character in the audience's own experiences?

Start in basic tango position.,
Perform the first four steps of the basic.,
Make the ocho cortado.,
Finish like a regular basic.",How to Do the Ocho Cortado1," You begin the ocho cortado in the basic tango start position. Keep your feet together and slide your right foot back so that it is about in the middle of the left foot. Make sure that your back is straight and that your weight is on the balls of your feet. Your right hand should be across your partner’s back. Your left elbow is bent at about 89 degrees and your left hand is gently holding your partner’s., The ocho cortado starts with the basic tango step. Step backward on your left foot, followed by your right, and ending with your feet parallel. Then take one step to your left, followed by two steps forward. Finish with your feet parallel and your partner in a cross position. Keep your knees flexed and move your feet in a quick staccato motion., Uncross your partner by pivoting them to your right, taking a step backward with your left foot as they step forward. Spiral your body to the right and step forward with your right foot, placing it between your partner’s feet. Finally, turn left and return your partner to cross position.This movement is the same as a regular ocho. However, by stepping between your partner’s feet, you abort or cut (cortado) the full movement.

, Step forward with your left foot and then take a side step to the right. Your feet should be facing forward and parallel beneath you. From this position you can make another move."

Finish the movement.",How to Do the Ocho Cortado2," Begin in the basic tango position. Your feet should be together with your right foot slid back to the middle of your left foot. Your left arm should be bent and rest on top of your partner’s right arm. Your left hand should be parallel to the ground with the thumb under your partner’s bicep and your fingertips just touching their armpit. Your right arm should extend out to the side and with your hand in your partner’s grip.Be sure to keep your back straight and your weight balanced on the balls of your feet.

, From the basic, you will take a step forward with your left foot, one side step to the right, and then two steps backward. End in cross position by dragging your left foot back and in front of your right foot, crossing your legs.Keep your knees flexed and move in a quick staccato motion.

, As your partner pivots you, uncross your legs. Take a step forward with your right leg, moving into a full ocho, pivoting 180 degrees on your right foot. Instead of finishing the turn, your partner will cut the movement with their right foot and pivot you back to cross position with your right leg behind your left.This movement begins the same as a regular ocho. However, by stepping forward with their right foot and ending the full motion, your partner makes it an ocho cortado.

, Once you have completed the ocho cortado, you complete the movement like the tango basic. Take a step backward with your right foot and then step to the left, placing your feet parallel to each other. From this position, you can follow your partner into other movements."
"
Accelerate the pace.,
Include multiple cortados.,
Cut the ocho in different places.",How to Do the Ocho Cortado3," Once you are comfortable with the movement, you can add some speed to the ocho cortado. You can add a quick-quick-slow acceleration to the cortado itself. When you are performing the cortado, move to the cadence of “quick-quick-slow” in your head. You can also add the quick-quick-slow acceleration to the last three steps of the basic tango. Applying the quick-quick-slow acceleration to both movements will add some extra intensity to the ocho cortado.If you are dancing in a competition or at a club, you might want to say the “quick-quick-slow” cadence in your head. However, while you are practicing, it may improve your timing to say it out loud.

, Because it begins and ends in the basic position, the lead can choose to perform multiple ocho cortados. A series of cortados can help the lead control the pace of the tango. You can also alternate between full ochos and ocho cortados., As the lead, you can place your cut foot in different locations to cut the ocho. For instance, when you make the cut, you can place your right foot outside your partner’s left foot and slide it back to cross. You can also cut an ocho on the outside of your partner’s right foot or the inside of their left."
"
Master the song on it's own, first.,
Consider how you would act out the words if you weren't singing.,
Use the song and lyrics themselves to your advantage.,
Use your body language to match the mood of the song and your character.,
Use the song's ""plot"" to figure out your acting arc.,
Focus on the song's key moments and transitions as an actor.,
Make your acting decisions in advance instead of relying on improvisation.,
React to the lines from the other actors as if they were spoken.,
Face the audience, unless otherwise noted by the director.,
Keep the acting simple to be effective.,
Practice until the acting and singing feels automatic.",How to Act While Singing1," Trying to do two things at once usually results in both things done poorly. Before you throw acting into the mix, make sure you can sing the song perfectly on it's own. Having the words and melody down cold will make it much, much easier to nail the acting.;
, Your first and most important goal is to convey the emotion in the song directly to the audience. As an exercise, try reading the song like a script, acting out the lyrics in your normal voice. If the song were a monologue, where is the emotion?


The ""illusion"" of musicals is that the songs come spontaneously from the characters, like a normal conversation. Preserving this immediacy is a big part of your acting., When singing and acting, your most important tool is to use your singing voice to convey emotion. At what points can you sing the notes differently to give them a little emotional flavor? Maybe your voice cracks or falters during a sad lyric, or you slowly rise in volume as the song gets angry. Places to take note of include:


Climactic or dramatic notes. These are almost always matched up to big acting moments.
Quiet, introspective passages. Where is the singing more subdued?
Realizations and plot turns. You need to make sure these lyrics are clearly and powerfully sung to keep the musical's story moving., This is the easiest and most effective way to ""act"" while you sing. Figure out the general mood you want to portray and use posture, walking style, and pacing to show it. You should keep good singing posture above all else, but you still have some room to play. Some ideas include:


Sad characters move slowly, usually with very deliberate movements. While you don't want to slouch while you sing, looking slightly down can give the same effect.
Happy or loving characters use big, expressive, and open gestures, as if trying to spread their wonderful emotions with the whole world.
Angry characters add weight, literally, to their movements, flying around the stage, stomping, and moving with short, rapid movements.
Pensive or thoughtful characters tend to repeat movements, like pacing, often with quick bursts of inspired movements (""Eureka!"") when the light bulb above their head brightens.

, Your arc is simply how your character changes. For example, a common musical number is when the new person arrives in a town, community, etc. At the beginning of the song, they are usually nervous and shy, but they grow in confidence as the song continues, coming out of their shell for a triumphant ending. As a singer-actor, noting this transition will help you act your way through it.


Always ask yourself -- what is my character's mood right before the song, and what is their mood right afterwards? How can I bridge these two feelings realistically?, In a good musical, the songs are vehicles for the characters to grow and change. It is your job to figure out during which lines and verses that happens and to show it to the audience. So if there is a moment halfway through the song when a female co-lead joins the hero, your face should show the happy surprise of a falling in love. If you're the villain and you suddenly hatch a scheme, jump into maniacally glee as the plan crosses your mind., If you have a good director or choreographer, this will likely happen for you. But even smaller or ""useless"" movements can be planned in advance to make them easier on the fly, and sticking to your artistic decision is crucial to pulling it off.


Use early rehearsals to try new things and get a feel for the character. However, as the show approaches you should pick a style and practice it daily, drilling it down so that it is automatic on stage.

, Acting in a musical is not only about the moments you are singing. It's about inhabiting the world of the play. Make sure you continue to listen to others' lines when they're singing, reacting appropriately even when you're not on the microphone.


Listen to the words as they're sung instead of just waiting for your cue.
Just like when you are singing, ask yourself how you would respond if someone said the lyrics normally, in conversation.

, All of the acting in the world won't matter if the audience can't see it. Remember to keep yourself facing the audience as you act and sing, letting them into your character's world. That said, temporarily turning away from the audience, or looking to the sides, is a good way to act out shame, fear, or passivity. Alternatively, turning your whole body to face the audience can drive home a big, powerful emotion or moment.

, At the end of the day, your singing voice should be doing the majority of the artistic ""heavy lifting."" Once you've settled on facial expressions and blocking, focus on singing as well as possible. Don't try to add lots of little tics and movements, overly-complicating the song and detracting from the actual music. Keep it simple, act naturally, and stay close to the lyrics and mood of the song -- do these three things and you'll be great.


Once you make a decision as an actor, be confident and stick to it. If it feels right to you it will feel right to the audience.

, Your primary goal is to sing the song as powerfully and effectively as possible, meaning you want the majority of your energy going into your voice. The easiest way to do this is make the acting so routine you could do it in your sleep.


Practice blocking and movement until you can do it with your eyes closed, then do one more practice run.
It may seem like excess, but practicing just singing, just acting, and practicing the two together is the best way to completely nail the part."
"
Smile, laugh, and have some fun.,
Keep moving, especially if you're not playing an instrument.,
Service the mood of the song, emulating it's tone and emotion.,
Rope the audience in with shared singing or clapping moments.,
Introduce the rest of the band during a quieter moment.,
Use a little light improvisation to get the crowd going while you play.,
Stand back and let the band shine during solos and instrumental sections.,
Play a simple percussion instrument if you'd like something specific to do.,
Consider pre-planning or reusing popular bits, stories, and actions.",How to Act While Singing2," If you're having an uncontrollably good time, your audience will too. You must keep the mood up, and both the band and the crowd will follow your lead. If you're smiling and having fun, they will be too. Even for tough shows, or when you're not feeling 100%, a ""fake it until you make it"" approach will help everyone have more fun.


Even serious acts and hardcore bands are having fun on stage while they play, so don't be afraid to let loose.

, Watch some of the classic lead singers, like Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, and note how he almost never stands still. For beginners, a good way to think about this is to try to sing individually to every person in the room at least once. So you might walk to the left and spend some time singing to them, then move right and sing a few bars to someone on the other side of the room.


If you have background singers, join them on the microphone for a few bars to show a sense of community.
If you're using a corded microphone, test out its length during mic checks to avoid accidentally pulling out of the amp.

, If you're playing a sadder ballad, you might not move at all. In fact, you might consider pulling up a stool or chair for the song, keeping you in place and providing a much more dramatic feel. Alternatively, don't just sit in the center of the stage for a barn-burning rock tune -- move, jump, dance, and sing your heart out as if possessed.


How can you change your facial expressions to match the songs? At what point are the lyrics suitably emotional? For a good lesson, watch Geoff Tate sing.
For a truly captivating performance, you can blend the two effects. For example, in a song that gains power slowly, like ""You Can't Always Get What Your Want,"" you may start sitting before you burst out of your seat with uncontrolled energy.

, As the front person of the band, you want to be big and in charge, pulling the audience into the moment and getting them engaged in the music. How easy this is will depend on the crowd and their enthusiasm, but you have a few tricks up your sleeve:


Clapping or keeping time is easy and works with any crowd. To do so, have the band keep playing for an extra 2-4 bars for a section, clapping high above your head to signal the audience to do the same.
Teaching an easy sing-along right before the song starts. For example, your chorus could have a section that counts ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5."" Before the song starts, tell the audience this and ask ""if they'd be willing to join the band for a song.""
Using a well-placed cover song. Playing a song everyone knows allows them to sing along, even if you're not a big time band yet. Once they start singing, they're much more likely to stay engaged throughout the show.

, This is a good way to fill time while tuning up, or to fill some time before or after taking the stage. Remember that, while you are the face of the band, you are not the only member in it. Take the time to introduce the people behind you to make everyone happier.


""On guitar, we have the incredible....""
""Holding down the rhythm is our very own...""
Don't be afraid to customize these introductions. You could say where they are from, an interesting fact, or pay your bandmates a complement on their skills.
Some lead singers introduce the band individually. So you might introduce the guitarist after a song-ending solo, the drummer after a big climactic drum beat, etc.

, One of the best examples is the classic reggae and ska line ""pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!"" which is used to help stir the band and dancers into a frenzy out on the floor. Countless lead singers, caught in the moment of music, have used ""yeah,"" ""let's go,"" and ""come on"" to keep the energy of the song going.


Don't be afraid to get swept up in the music -- it's the best way to get the audience swept up as well., You should not be holding the spotlight on yourself the entire time. Whenever your bandmates take over a section of the song, drop back and let the audience focus on them for a moment. At the most, you can very quickly introduce or set them up before they play:


""Take it away, ________"" is a great way to pass the baton to your guitarist right before he starts shredding a solo., This can even change depending on the song, as it's a little strange during slower songs to be bouncing around with full energy. The classic option is a tambourine, as you can beat it against your hip in time with the song. Some singers will even pull out wood blocks, cowbells, and triangles as the song requires.


Ask your bandmates if their are any songs that you can easily learn on an acoustic guitar, playing it occasionally mix up your performance. In some cases you don't have to turn this guitar up loudly, just using it as a quiet prop, which helps hide any mistakes.
While it seems obvious, don't play an instrument on stage if you struggle to keep time while singing. Your voice is the first priority.

, If you've ever seen the same band twice during the same tour, you'll see how popular this is. When you tell a story about your day that gets a huge laugh in between songs, try the story again the next show and see if goes over just as well. Furthermore, you can even start designing movements and acting ideas that bring your band and audience together.


Is there any back and forth joke or dialogue between you and other bandmates that people enjoy?
If you like to dance, are their moves or routines that you keep coming back to?
For hard-rocking bands, are their any big, climactic moments where you might stick a stage dive or dramatic dance move?"

Emote the lyrics as you sing them.,
Use your arms and posture to lend gravitas to your performance.,
Tailor your performance to your current mood or emotions.,
Engage your audience in between songs with stories or jokes.,
Connect with every corner of the room.,
Let your music carry you away.,
Tape yourself playing and watch it later to get ideas on improvement.",How to Act While Singing3," Singer-songwriters, solo concert vocalists, and other performers who sing by themselves are usually intimate, personal artists. Your goal as a singer is to make the audience feel like they're alone in a room with you, getting to see a deeply personal and affected side of yourself.


Where can you growl a line angrily, or falter sadly over a heartbroken line? How can you sing the lyrics in a unique, personal way.
A good strategy is to think about each song as if it is the first time you've ever sung it. If you were speaking the lyrics to a close friend, how would they make your behave?
While he has a band behind him, check out Eric Clapton's performance on ""Unplugged,"" especially the song ""Tears in Heaven,"" for well-emoted singing.

, Luciano Pavarotti has one of the most expressive and well-acted performances around, using big gestures and emotional facial expressions to truly embody his songs. This is especially important for his songs, which are in a variety of languages that the audience may need cues to understand, but any singer can learn from his facial expressions and powerful yet personalized posture.


Even if you're playing an instrument, you can use your arms to spur on the audience or add drama, using bigger movements than necessary and putting a little theatricality into your play.

, When you're playing alone you have much more room for improvisation and personality. The most obvious example is the tempo, which you get to set by yourself without worrying if a band will follow. If you're feeling high energy, push the speed a bit. If the song requires something more thoughtful and contemplative, slow things down a bit. Similarly, your singing and playing volume can be adjusted to add nuance to your singing performance -- louder for expressive, big emotions and quieter for contemplative sections.


This is just as important within songs, as you can modulate tempo and volume to create tension and suspense while you play. Doing so is called ""dynamics."", What you say is up to you, but a good rule of thumb is to keep it short and sweet. Don't be afraid to cycle the same stories and comments in, especially if they go well with one audience. Some ideas of things to say include:


Stories about the song's inspiration or writing process
Comments on the location, venue, or event.
A personal anecdote from your day or week.
Questions or comments on people in the audience.
Thanks and gratitude for coming and enjoying your music.

, Make a point to face, sing to, and look at every section of the room. A good way to do this is to just create a simple pattern, such as turning back and forth, but as you get better you'll find more natural ways to pull it off. Use your eyes to bring as many audience members into your world as possible, and don't be afraid to look right at people.


The easiest way to scan the audience is to look right over the top of the heads of people in the middle seats, turning right and left from there., The best way to act naturally on stage is to just keep doing it. The more you get in front of people and start playing, the more second-nature the entire thing becomes, allowing you to express more and more of your personality while you play. Instead of putting on airs or playing a character you're not comfortable as, just focus on playing the very best song that you can. More times than not your expression and body language will naturally follow suit., Watching and listening to your old performances is the best way to get the audience's perspective, and to see where certain sections could use improvement. When watching yourself, try not to be too critical, as it is easy to beat yourself up for small mistakes. Instead, pay attention to the audience. What gets the biggest claps, where do people seem a little bored, and how long does it take them to get into the mood of each song?

The director, dramaturge, playwright and actors meet for as little as a day up to two weeks reading through the play and making notes on things that work and things that don't.
The playwright may rewrite certain things at this point before it is put in front of the workshop audience.
The play is staged usually in an intimate setting for an audience who then gets to share their experience of the play afterwards.
Usually the feedback is taken in Q & A format where either the director or the dramaturge asks questions that the playwright has chosen.
The answers collected from the audience will help the playwright determine how to fix the remaining problems of the play so that it is ready for the stage.;
, If you are watching and you become bored, or get lost analyse why you are feeling this way. What you discover may be helpful feedback for the writer.

, Think of what you want to say before you say it, and don't repeat an idea someone else has already said. You can reinforce their statements with nods or applause depending on the mood of the theatre.

, Speaking around the point is not helpful to the process.

, Excessive negativity is not helpful or enjoyable to listen to.

, That is fine, but remember that you are here to help them refine this story not to redesign it into something else.

, Does that line sound awkward, or does that actor just have an irritating voice?

, Your comment may ultimately be disregarded if it does not suit the playwright's taste or a large portion of the audience disagrees with you.

Slumping your shoulders forward
Bending your torso downward
Sitting with your torso bent toward your knees;
, A vacant or distant expression is often interpreted as a sign of sadness or of being lost in thought. In particular, if you keep your gaze pointed downward, others might think you are sad., Drooping, lowered, or closed eyelids are part of many facial expressions that indicate sadness.If you want to pretend you are sad by using this method, it is best to combine it with other physical signs of sadness, since lowering your eyelids alone might just make it seem like you are sleepy or squinting.

, A tensed, tightened brow is a classic sign of being lost in thought. Studies also show that it is often combined with other physical signs of sadness.This technique works especially well when combined with others, such as gazing downward.

, A downturned brow can be a sign of sadness as well as one of displeasure.Frowning too intensely, however, can make it look like you are scowling or angry. Use this technique sparingly and in combination with other physical signs of sadness.

, You can also show sadness with your mouth by sticking your lip outwards.A pouting expression can show that a person is upset for a variety of reasons. When it is combined with other techniques, such as gazing downwards or slumping your body, it is sure to make others believe you are sad.

, Headaches are a common sign of depression or sadness.If you want to make others believe that you are sad, you can try to pretend that you have a headache. This can be easily done by touching or rubbing your face, especially your forehead.

, Shedding tears is a typical reaction to feeling sad.If you can cry at will, other people might easily believe that you are upset. However, it can be difficult to cry convincingly, since most people can tell the difference between real and pretend expressions of sadness. Only attempt this method if you are skilled at appearing to shed real tears.


On the other hand, you might be able to use the element of surprise to your advantage. If you can start crying suddenly, you might shock people and make them believe that you are genuinely sad.

, Well-trained actors don’t “play sad,” since this can come across as melodramatic and staged. Actors that want to convey sadness convincingly try to play an objective.For instance, if an actor is trying to look sad because his grandmother died, he will focus on showing how much he cared about and misses her, rather than just shedding lots of tears. If you are trying to act sad, you can borrow this method. For instance:


If you want to act sad so that someone will realize that they hurt you, think about how the person upset you, in addition to using physical signs to convey sadness.
If you want to act sad so that people will leave you alone, focus your thoughts on why it is that you genuinely want solitude.

, Commonly recognized as an expression of grief, sighing around other people will be taken as a sign of sadness.Don’t overdo it by sighing too loudly or too frequently, however.


Try sighing quietly as you gaze downward, especially when you know other people are looking at you.
When someone asks you a question like “How’s it going?,” sigh and look downward before responding with something like “I don’t know,” or “Not great.”

, Loss of appetite frequently accompanies sadness or grief.If you want others to believe that you are sad, try not eating much when you are around them. You can also say things like “I’m just not hungry today,” and listlessly poke at your food.

, Being sad or depressed can make a person feel fatigued or exhausted.If you constantly tell other people that you are tired or have no energy, they might start to believe that you are sad. Try saying things like:


“I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just don’t have any energy today.”
“I just didn’t want to get out of bed today.”
“I want to just crawl under a blanket and go back to sleep.”

, When a person loses interest in activities or other things he or she previously enjoyed, it might be a sign of sadness.If you want to convince others that you are sad, act like you no longer care about some things. For instance:


If your friends always go out to the movies on the weekend, tell them you just don’t feel like it this week.
If people show you something they expect you to find fun or interesting, like a new cat video, act like you just don’t care.
If you are known as a big fan of something, like a sport, video game, or music, announce that you’ve lost interest in it.

, When people are sad or depressed, they may have unusual difficulty concentrating.To pretend you are sad, act like you are lost in thought or forgetful.


For instance, when someone comes up to talk to you, don’t look at the person. When he or she starts talking to you, don’t respond right away. Keep looking away, and after a few seconds look up at the person and say something like “What was that?” or “I’m sorry, I was lost in thought—what did you say?”

, Withdrawal from other people is common when someone is sad.If you want to convince others that you are sad, you will have to spend some time separated from them. It’s not hard to convey sadness this way, even when you can’t really get away from people. You can try:


Walking alone behind other people when you have to travel in a group.
Going into another room by yourself when you are at home with others.
Standing in a corner by yourself when you have to be indoors with others.
Walking away from other people without saying anything to any of them.
Not responding when other people try to communicate with you by text, email, phone, or in any other way.

, Don't shy away from the dictionary! If you're having trouble, try using more modern translations or versions.

, The purpose of this is not necessarily only to provide complexity and nuance, but chiefly to provide depth. Nothing is worse than to see the words of our language's greatest artist portrayed flatly without forethought.

If so, how? What do the words reveal about the character?

, Operative words are action words, a.k.a verbs. ""Juicy words"" are just words that are fun to say! Like saucy. Also, your operative words can be juicy words like ""swear"" or ""beseech.""

Understanding what's happening around a scene can help you better understand your character's motivation and emotions.


Read the scene in full. If you have the time, read the full script from which the scene is taken. This will give you a sense of what is at stake in this moment.
Consider the character you're playing. What is this character feeling during this scene? How does this character's past, present, and future come into play during the scene?
What is the context of this moment? If a character is yelling, arguing, or crying, there was obviously some buildup to this point. Try to look for the complex underlying layers of a character in a dramatic scene. For example, a character may be crying at his father's funeral. He is sad, of course, but there may be other factors at play. What was the character's relationship with his father like? What emotions might the character be experiencing? What memories is he recalling in this scene?;
, For best effects in a dramatic scene, think about character over situation. Audiences are familiar with a variety of sad and dramatic scenarios. What makes a drama interesting is a particular character's reaction to that scenario.Consider your character's emotional investment in a given moment. If your character is arguing with someone else, why is that character drawn into this argument? What is going on in the character's head on a deeper level?A good experiment to help can be a free write in which you write from a character's point of view. Try to imagine how that character is feeling in this moment. Pretend you're the character, writing a diary entry after the scene took place. Really dig deep, considering the character's past and present, and try to write how you imagine the character feels.
Audiences get bored with drama for the sake of drama. If you can show why this dramatic moment matters, in context of a specific character, this will ground your audience. They may respond more favorably to your performance., While scanning your scene, take note of exclamation points that appear in the writing. Actors are often unsure how to handle exclamation points. Do they signal that your character should talk louder? Do they signal excitement, anger, fear? The answer depends on the scene's context. You should understand the use of exclamation points, and how you should read them, going into a scene.An exclamation point usually indicates a line should be delivered with slightly more force. However, the added force can stem from a variety of reasons. A character may be overjoyed. However, she may also be frightened or angry. Read the scene in full to get a sense of how to deliver a line with an exclamation point at the end.A line like, ""What a beautiful day!"" can be read several different ways depending on context. If your character is exhausted after having a long fight with her mother, it likely indicates frustration. You could read the line with a sarcastic tone. If the line is delivered during the main character's wedding day, it may indicate joy. You can deliver the line with an upbeat, excited tone., Actors often get so caught up in portraying the emotion of a scene they forget the physical action in the stage directions. Physical action can often carry a lot of emotional weight in a scene. A character may, for example, touch his or her face when talking, indicating he or she is nervous. Make sure you read the scene for physical action and incorporate that action into your performance.A lot of physicality goes into a scene. What the characters are doing in a scene speaks volumes. Read stage directions carefully and see how your character moves. Maybe your character keeps rearranging furniture nervously while talking, for example. Make sure to incorporate this into your performance.You should also strive to pay attention to your body, even if there are not specific stage directions. In acting, you'll use your entire body to convey emotion. How might a character stand if he's feeling tense? How might a happy person gesticulate? Keep character emotions in mind and try to use your body to reflect what a character is feeling., When acting, it's important to lose yourself in a scene to an extent. Emotion is very fluid. As you act out a scene, try to let the emotional resonance flow through you naturally.


Allow your emotions to be fluid. If you try to constrict or control the emotional arch of the scene, your performance may feel forced. Try to really get inside your character's head and experience what that character is feeling. This will be easier to do if you have, as we discussed earlier, truly made an effort to get to know your character.It is very hard to try to sustain or control emotion. While you should be aware of yourself and your body, you may find yourself suddenly being struck by a line. If you find your voice wavering or getting upset, go with it. Allow yourself to embrace your emotional response in any given scene., Humor can be a great way to shake up an emotional scene. As so many actors and actresses play up the drama, you can stand out in a scene by playing up the humor. Even in dark moments, there may be slightly humorous lines embedded in a scene. Try to focus energy on moments of levity rather than glossing over them. Your audience will appreciate a laugh between the tears and respond well to an actor who can deliver funny lines with ease., When playing an emotion, try to shake up the scene by playing that emotion in a non-obvious way. That is, play the opposite. This may make your character's emotions feel more intense for an audience.If your character is angry, you may be inclined to yell or raise your voice. However, what about stone cold anger? You can instead convey anger through silence or quiet words. If your character is sad, maybe portray him in a manic light. Your character is trying to mask his sadness by appearing resilient and cheerful.When it comes to an antagonistic character, avoid playing the character as openly malevolent. Instead, play the character as polite, friendly even. Oftentimes, villains that appear cheery can be even scarier to audiences than outright angry villains.This may not work every time. You may want to do some trial and error in rehearsal to see if playing the opposite works. It's a technique worth trying, however, if you're acting out a dramatic scene.

, A scene should be somewhat self-contained. When acting out an emotional scene, do not try to change your character's emotional reaction too much in the course of that scene. Try to stick to one, overarching emotion and concentrate on that for the entirety of the scene. If your character is sad, play him as sad. If he's happy, play him as happy. You can change your tone, and the manner in which your character is playing an emotion. However, you should try to center yourself on one key emotion., When acting out a dramatic scene, you may be inclined to overact. Oftentimes, you lose control of your voice and end up shouting or talking too loudly. Try to be aware of the volume of your voice and keep your tone even and in control.


Even if your character is supposed to be angry, shouting too loudly can be a bad idea. You'll have a hard time controlling the tone of your voice, and how you're delivering the lines, if you're screaming on stage. Keep your voice somewhat quiet and even.
Paying attention to physicality can help. If you feel your voice is inadequate when it comes to conveying drama, you may unconsciously raise your voice. However, tune into the physical when you feel you're not delivering in a scene. Do something with your body to convey feelings of anger, sadness, and frustration. This will help you feel like you're portraying your emotions effectively, lessening your need to overexert your voice., In an emotional scene, focus on what your character needs in that moment. Why is this moment important to your character? Focus less on the scene's significance to the overall story arch and more on its significance to your character.


If a character is arguing with someone else, do not focus on arguing against the other character. Instead, think of it as your character arguing for that particular relationship. Your character wants his relationship with this person to play out in a certain way. That's the fulcrum of the emotion in this scene.Getting to know your character can really help here. If you perform a scene and feel so-so about your job, spend more time reviewing the work and getting inside your character's head. This can give you more insight into your character's needs, allowing you to channel them while acting.

, Crying on cue can be a challenge for many actors, but a lot of emotional scenes require crying. If you're struggling to find a way to bring tears to your character's eyes, try using reverse psychology. Thinking as your character, think to yourself, ""I'm not going to cry. No matter what, I won't let them see me cry."" In real life, you've probably had an experience when you've tried to holdback tears. Channeling the desire not to cry, despite needing to, can help trigger tears on stage., You can also consider moments that made you cry in the past. If you know you have to cry during a scene, spend some time thinking of sad moments before stepping onto the stage.It may help to do a free write on the topic of sad moments, jotting down the saddest moments you can recall. This will give you a stockpile of sad memories you can use in the event you need to cry on cue.
You do not have to focus solely on your own personal experiences. It may be too stressful to channel personal experiences. Instead, try to think of a moment from a book, movie, or TV show that made you cry.

, Crying is very much a physical reaction. If you go through the physical motions involved in crying, this may trigger actual tears. Consider what you do when you cry in real life. Maybe you start to breathe heavily, sniffle, and make small sobbing sounds. Start to engage in these actions. You may find that, in response, your body produces tears., If you're really in a bind to make yourself cry, you can look at the stage lights. Bright stage lights may irritate the eyes, resulting in tears. Many professional actors use this trick if they're struggling to cry in a particular scene."

You should also wrinkle your brow, giving you the appearance of being deep in thought, and squint your eyes slightly. It also may benefit you to keep a straight face.It can take some practice to get a perfect serious expression. Practice in front of the mirror.
You can also ask for honest feedback. Take a picture of your serious face and send it to a friend. Have him guess what emotion you're trying to convey.;
, Giggling can make you look nervous. It can also make it seem like you're not taking what the other party is saying seriously. Maintain a straight face during conversation.If you have a natural tendency to giggle when nervous, work against it. Focus extra hard on the conversation if you feel the need to giggle creeping in.
Keep in mind it's rude not to smile or giggle ever. If a co-worker makes a joke, offer a smile and a brief giggle; however, keep it under control. Uproarious laughter is unlikely to make you look serious.
Practicing deep breathing can help you calm yourself and it gives you something to pay attention to if you’re trying to avoid nervous giggling.

, Serious people are often quiet and contemplative. It can benefit you to adopt a serious pose when lost in thought.Avoid making eye contact with people around you. Fold your arms and cross your legs.
Stay quiet and maintain a serious expression.
You do not stay in this pose permanently. You only need to hold it until you work through your thoughts. Holding it too long may look awkward.

, During a serious discussion, try not to react to what you hear. Be aware of your face. Try to hold your serious expression, even if someone says something frustrating or upsetting.This can be particularly helpful in a business negotiation. You will look unfazed by the other party's offers, leading them to believe you're not easily intimidated.
Keep in mind this technique is not appropriate for every situation. A business meeting, or a school function, may warrant a neutral expression, but it may not be appropriate in in casual conversation. You may come off as rude.

, This can make you sound more authoritative, which can be read as serious. A high-pitched tone can make others read you as nervous and less powerful. Try lowering the pitch of your voice slightly, especially in situations that call for you to behave in a serious fashion.Just before you have to act serious, put your lips together and say, ""Um huh, um huh"" several times. This helps relax your vocal cords, helping you better control your pitch.

, This can make others read you as more serious and driven. At work especially, watch your language to make sure you're speaking in a more formal tone.Make sure you use standard English and follow grammatical rules. For example, do not say, ""Where are y'all going for drinks after work?"" Instead, say, ""Where are we going tonight after work?""
Avoid slang words and profanity. These will not only make you sound less serious, they can get you in trouble at work.
Be polite. Following traditional rules of courtesy can help your professional appearance. In a meeting, for example, say something like, ""Excuse me, Mr. Wilson, I'd like to share my thoughts on that matter, if possible.""

, Serious people tend to avoid multitasking, as it interferes with their productivity. Give your full attention to a single task before moving on to the next one.It can help to make a schedule for yourself. For example, from 11 to noon, you return emails. From noon to one, you work on a report.
Multitasking encourages your brain to divide its attention. It can actually make you less productive, as you'll have trouble focusing enough to complete tasks efficiently.

, Often people react to uncomfortable or tense situations by laughing, not because it's funny, but because they don't know how to deal with the tension. If you need to remain serious in an uncomfortable situation, from giving a presentation to going to a funeral service, use thought techniques to keep yourself in check. For instance, try thinking of something serious (like how important this presentation is to your grade or your upcoming promotion), or try thinking about a difficult math equation and try to solve it. This may help distract you from your impulse to giggle and help ""sober"" you up.

You can also try pinching yourself or biting the inside of your cheek, or taking a long, deep breath to regain your composure.

, Your boss or teacher will be impressed if you avoid the distraction of your cell phone, iPad, or other electronic devices. Make a point of abandoning such technologies in areas where you need to act serious.Turn your phone off when you're at your desk or at a meeting.
Do not take out your cell phone during work or school. You can catch up on calls or texts after you finish work for the day.

, This can make you look reliable, which is a trait associated with serious people. Never miss a deadline or let an obligation fall to the wayside.Take steps to make sure you know your obligations. A calendar, with reminders for certain deadlines, can help.
It can be very beneficial to you to look dependable. Dependable people may be more likely to be chosen for certain opportunities.

, This will make you look focused and driven, traits associated with the very serious. Keep your workspace clean and always be on top of daily tasks.Take this as an opportunity to do a major overhaul of your workspace. Stop by a local print shop and pick up a variety of folders and files. Organize your work by categories, due dates, and so on.

To-do lists and reminders can help. Leave reminders around your home, office, and workspace regarding deadlines. Keep a to-do list every day and check off tasks as you complete them.

, Being serious can be a great advantage in some situations. Socially, however, you may come off as too intense. If people feel uncomfortable around you, this could affect your success.If you act serious during conversations, people may misread this as aloof. Eventually, people may realize you're simply very focused on the conversation, but an initial impression can be hard to shake.
Balance out the serious act with cues that show you're listening. Do not cross your arms, or put a bag on your lap. This looks like you're shutting someone out. Make eye contact on occasion, and try to look comfortable. Do not fidget or squirm during conversation.

, No one should maintain a serious act all the time. Socially, it's not appropriate to maintain a strictly serious demeanor. Try to loosen up at events where you are meant to relax.Let people into your personal space. Allow for casual touching, like a pat on the shoulder or back.
Show people you're listening a little bit more. Respond with comments like, ""Hmmm,"" or, ""I see."" Nod as a person talks.
Soften your facial muscles a bit, abandoning the serious expression. Smile and laugh when appropriate.

, People who are highly focused frequently enjoy the outdoors. The tranquility can help you momentarily relax. When you re-enter school or the office, you'll feel recharged enough to get back to acting serious.Go for a walk outside during break time. If you're near a park or woods, walk around there.
If you work in the city, take hikes during the weekend. You may have to drive, or take a train, to get out of town.

, No one can act serious 24 hours a day. Incorporating breaks into your daily schedule is important to keep you focused when you need to be.Set a reminder on your phone that goes off every 50 minutes, letting you know you need to take a break.
Breaks do not have to be long. You can simply get up and stretch for a few minutes, or go get a cup of coffee or tea.

Highlight your lines so you do not have to look all through your script to find them.,
Read your script until you fully understand the plot of the play.,
Write it out.,
Get into character by asking yourself questions about the character.,
Practice reading the lines out loud.,
Break it up.,
Try singing your lines.This might help if you love singing; then it will just be like singing a normal song as you will read later on.,
Take a break.,
Practice with a partner.,
Practice with friends or family.,
Record your lines.,
Be sure you know all of your lines the night before the performance.",How to Memorize Your Lines,"


Make notes if necessary, such as how loudly or softly to speak, to slow down or speed up, and so forth.
It may help to write down or circle your cues to speak.;
, This means understanding your character's intention (what they want), your character's obstacles, (what stands in the way of what they want) and their tactics (what they do to get what they want) and the emotion of it (the energy, if it is sad, or happy, or exciting.) Directors want to see you have emotion and energy. This way, if you forget your lines during the show, you will be able to make up something to say so the audience won't notice.


Pretend you are that character for a day and act exactly like the character's personality.

, This is self-explanatory––write out your lines repeatedly. This gets the lines into your subconscious memory. To save on paper, you can also type them out, then simply erase and start again.


Write it out with the other hand. If you are right-handed, write out your lines with your left hand, and vice versa. By using your less familiar hand, your brain has to think three times as hard about what you are writing., If your blocking is to walk upstage carrying a towel, ask yourself why your character would be doing that. You can also get into character by thinking deeply about why your character acts the way they do. Even make up a background story for your character - what happened before the script, and what is going to happen afterwards.

, Say the cue, your line, and the line after it. Do it one section or page at a time.


Say your lines in different ways. If your lines call for sadness say them happily, if it calls for a whisper scream it loudly. Use different emotions. You might make yourself laugh with some of your choices, which helps you to remember that sentence.
If you have a monologue, try repeating one or two sentences at time. Then add another sentence. When you have about five sentences done that way, repeat them over for a little bit to make sure you have it.
Use projection (volume) and inflection (speaking with expression) to your advantage.

, Try to conquer small parts of your script at a time. It is difficult to memorize all your lines at once. By taking small parts of your script, you can add lines one at a time until you have your script memorized. A good way to work through is to go scene by scene.

, Also, it will program that song in your brain forever, so you will never forget your lines

, If you are tired from rehearsing, relax. It helps your brain work better. Also, try doing some exercises to help relax your brain.

, Ask the other person to read your script while you rehearse it to them. Ask them to highlight or circle parts that you skipped or jumbled the words.


If you don't have a partner there are a bunch of apps for your phone that can help your memorize and rehearse your lines. For example, try the free app Line Please.

, Have them look at your script, and recite your lines to them.

, Use an MP3 player or something to record yourself reading all the lines (with gaps of silence where you're supposed to talk). You can then play it while driving or exercising and say your lines in your head. You learn your lines as well as the other actors' cue lines. It's like learning the lyrics to a song; the more you listen to it, the better you are at ""singing"" along with the recording.


Record it on your phone (one sentence at a time) and play it again and again then join in and then try without it.
Record the whole play, and when it's your line, don't say anything. Then play it and you can say your lines, and it will be like if you are practicing with the cast!
When practicing with a friend or family member, ask them to read the lines of the other role so you know when to come in without looking at your script.
Not only will this help you remember your lines, it will help you remember your cues.

, If you can practice before the show starts, do so.

Practice Makes Perfect.,
Warm Up.,
The big day!,
Its ok to make mistakes.,
Have fun!",How to Overcome Stage Fright While Singing," The reason why most people get stage fright is fearing they're gonna make a mistake. So, if you know your song inside and out, the anxiety should go down. Make sure you choose a song that fits your vocal range (you could add a note out of your range to wow your audience!) But, don't strain your throat!;
, This article is based on singing (but some of these tips apply for all). Sing a scale in your range and go from there. When you're in public you can hum to warm up your voice. Humming can be used if you're speaking also and is a great substitute for singing your scales. Also, if your song doesn't go in a scale order or if you want a challenge, try singing ""do, me, so, ti, re, ti, so, me, do"" and etc. Or you can practice dynamics with your voice and etc.

, Make sure you don't drink milk this day. It clogs up your throat. Instead, drink water. Make sure you warm up and run through your song a few times (don't do it too much because you will strain your throat!). While waiting to perform, breathe slowly. Don't talk to anyone who will distract you or let you down. Do calm exercises like yoga, deep breathing, and etc. Thirty seconds or so before you go on. Drink a small gulp of water and stay quiet. You might be REALLY nervous. When you perform, look slightly above the audience, judges, and etc. So you'll be performing to the wall!

, While performing or practicing, if you make mistakes then don't be hard on yourself. Take it easy. If you give that mistakes too much of attention its most likely going to drive you to make more mistakes. So when you make a mistake while you are performing...

Accept that you made a mistake.
Move on.







, As clichéd as this is, have fun! You're doing something you love! Put your heart into it! But if you mess up, that's ok. Everybody makes mistakes. If you stay calm about it. They might not have noticed. If your voice cracked, it's not the end of the world!

Write down everything you think and want to do freely.,
Take a look at your aims.,
Continue writing until you feel that you've adequately addressed the feelings that truly represent you.,
Begin to put your list of feelings as actions into action.,
Express yourself through talking, shouting, explaining yourself.,
Wear the clothes that you like and care about.,
Devote as much or as little time to your appearance as you see fit.,
Let your emotions, feelings and opinions have self-determined outlets.,
Come up with more of your own actions.",How to Act Like How You Feel," Write it down in a list. This is the calm approach to take, instead of just blowing up like TNT in the middle of normal life and letting loose whenever the urge bubbles up.


Consider getting a diary or a locked notebook, or whatever works for you––from an A4 paper to the corner of a wall, writing will help you to work out just what things you really feel like doing to let your feelings out.;
, Remove ideas that are harmful, stupid, thoughtless or plain dangerous. These are your dark thoughts and they're okay, everyone has them but let them stay on paper alone. Don't feed them. For all the positive, nurturing, flourishing, dramatic, wonderful, growing, inspiring and creative things, leave them on the list. They are the direction in which you wish to head, to express your true self. This doesn't mean letting go of the daring, the wild and the vibrant––it just means being realistic and sensible about what is doable, what is safe enough for you and what won't bring harm to others.


If you discover that your aims keep erring toward hurting yourself or others, seek help with a parent, spouse, counselor, therapist or psychiatrist. You cannot remain in this dark place––allowing it to define you can foster pain and hardship; given there are some good ways to handle your darker creative self without giving in to the demons, take the opportunities to do so by letting others help you.

, Then think about how to express those feelings through actions. The actions may be in private, in public; they may be via video or audio, via real life or via art and craft; they might be expressed through sports, a hobby, a shouting festival or eclectic clothing and hair. It's totally up to you how to begin expressing these feelings through actions.

, Once you're happy that you've defined the actions that will give life to your feelings, find the outlets for these feelings. There are many possibilities, and it'll be up to your creative muse to define, refine and act upon them as wished. The following steps provide a few suggestions for ways to act as you feel.

, You might want to shout out who you actually are in a public area, or calmly explain that you are not that type of girl who likes pinky cute dresses to your mom. Punching pillows and not taking no as an answer is also good. In this case. Not in all cases! If you smile and add a That's me after each outstanding action you do might make you seem and be confident.

, Don't wear things because they're fashionable, your friends like them or they're all the rage on Instagram. Wear them because you like the statement that they make for you.


If you must, find a friend who will wear the same clothes and support you until you feel confident enough to do it alone.

, Braid your leg hairs if you wish; who says being hairless is the ultimate form of happiness anyway? Shave them off in strange designs if you'd rather. Just don't change your appearance because you feel the need to conform––treat your appearance as an extension of expressing how you feel and be proud of it.


Makeup is completely individual to you. If you love it, wear it. If you hate it, don't wear it. If you want it on some days and not other days, that's just fine.
If you want long hair, short hair, curly hair, dyed hair, no hair, frizzy hair, gray hair, it's your choice. Just don't cook at the local fast food take-out without a hair net; in other words, be sensible about where and in what form you express yourself.

, There are rules about everything in social life, you don't have to look far to find them and even less further to find those who love to remind you of them. However, a lot of these rules are for the lost, not for utility for one's self-expression. If you want to act as you feel, here are some of the common areas where the rules police can hamper your freedom in ways that aren't very helpful, and you're free to express yourself as you need to:


Grieving: If you wish to grieve over the loss of a loved one for five minutes or five years, that's personal to you; it's how you feel and any arbitrary time limit on how long is long enough or too long is an imposition of someone else's idea of what's right.
Success: Different meanings of success can be found everywhere across countries, across the regions, across the world. While some people may lay claim to a perfect formula of what looks like success, only you can decide that for yourself. If where you are in life right now works for you, that's great––it's okay to be satisfied with the choices you've made at various points in your life.
Parenting: Everyone knows how to be a great parent until they become one. After the children leave home, suddenly they're great parents again. It is telling that those in the middle of the doing the actual parenting get so much advice from people younger and older than them on getting it right, from those yet to know and those who have forgotten just how hard it is. Remember, their rules may have worked for them (or seem good to them) but yours are just as good.
Education: Make up your own mind by using critical thinking and being a good philosopher. Don't abdicate the ability to think for yourself. Reflect on deeper issues often and come up with what you believe, think and value. Listen to others but remember that their rules work for them; let yours, not theirs, define who you are.

, Make this a lifelong process, to express yourself as you feel, in ways that help others to do the same and that are inclusive of others, respectful of yourself and others and that let people see the real you when the moment is right."

Get a Death Note.,
Wear a lot of silver jewelry.,
Wear dark, Gothic, or punk make up.,
Show an obsession with apples.,
Wear a lot of black.,
Follow one of your friends around like a creeper.,
Don't play for sides.,
Your body posture should be tall and skinny.,
Laugh.,
Most of all, be yourself.",How to Act Like Ryuk from Death Note (Female)," This is a simple black notebook with ""Death Note"" written on the front and, usually, a list of rules and instructions inside. In the manga series, the Death Note is a way to kill people. Make your own Death Note notebook, or buy one on Amazon or eBay.;
, It doesn't have to be expensive or fancy, just try to keep the majority of your jewelry, silver chains, bangles, studs, tapers, facial piercings, and rings. Wear a lot but don't overdo it, which means just make the accessories stand out without having a heavy weight of them on your costume. For more references, see a photo of Ryuk and try as much to mirror him.

, The minimum amount of make up you should wear is black eyeliner, gray/blue/white eye shadow, black mascara, and a red/wine lipstick.

, Ryuk is clearly obsessed with apples - he carries them everywhere, and they can even be used as a bargaining tool to make him do something. You don't need to eat apples all the time, but at least carry one around with you, for they are basically one of Ryuk's trademarks.

, Black shirts, black skinny jeans/skirts and the like are recommended for extra effects and mood.

, Just like the actual Ryuk following Light/Kira.

, it's not in Ryuk's character.

, Think about imitating Ryuk when he floats around Light. Keep a hunched back, limp arms, and a big, creepy smile on your face.

, Do this in a discreet manner when something amuses you.

, No matter what the people or critics say, this is your costume, your character, your mood and just basically ""you"". Add your own touch to this. Be unique!

Get a furry, ragged coat.,
Find a ""little black dress"".,
Consider adding brown evening gloves with long red claws attached.,
Do your hair -- Grizabella usually has curly gray hair.,
Get the makeup right.",How to Make a Grizabella Costume," This can be an old fur coat/stole (if you don't have one of these lying around the house, your local antique store or garage sale probably does). If you prefer, you can make the coat/stole out of faux fur. Some people have also made nice looking ones by sewing together feather boas. The idea is for it to look old and ragged, and usually it is either brown or gray. Her coat is one of the most recognisable parts of her costume.;
, If you don't have one of these, the thrift store probably has one at a fairly cheap price. Don't buy a brand new one unless you plan to wear it other times; a new dress can be quite expensive if it's just for a costume. Wear grayish tights with the dress. If you want, you can dye/paint black markings on these to look more cat-like. Grizabella also often wears high heels, but any nice shoes will work.

, (If you include these, they will probably have to be homemade, as stores will likely only sell them around Halloween, if at all.)

, This is one advantage she has over the other Jellicles: her wig is much easier to obtain. You can probably obtain a curly gray wig online or at costume stores. For her ears, simply wear a cat ears headband over the wig (the headband can be easily hidden in the hair). If you want, you can put gray faux fur on the cat ears to make them look more like Grizabella. Alternately, if the wig is short, you can style it to resemble cat ears (this is done by twisting two bunches of hair and gelling them in place).

, Start by putting a light grayish foundation all over your face. Now add some blackish marks around your eyes to look like messed up mascara. (To get an idea of what this looks like, think about what mascara looks like when someone cries.) Then put on a bright red lipstick, and make blotches with a darker red to look like bloody, cracked lips. If you want, you can also smear the lipstick. After this is done, add some cat-like black and white markings. Also, make your nose black like a cat's nose and draw a thin line between your lips and your nose. Usually there will be two thin black lines extending from the outside corners of the lips to resemble a cat's mouth. However, don't add this if you can't get it to look right; it's not supposed to look like a smile (which can sometimes happen).

Set design can be learned through a structured college program or be self-taught.,
Here are a few Books, including many that Universities use as text books


""Stage Design: A Practical Guide"" by Gary Thorne (Basic beginner's book)
""Drafting for the Theatre"" by Dennis Dorn (Detailed technical drawing standards for theatre)
""The Backstage Handbook"" by Paul Carter (A must have for a theatre Carpenter
""Sculpting Space in the Theater: Conversations with the top set, light and costume designers"" by Babak Ebrahimian (Very interesting with many pictures and great interviews)
""'What is Scenography' by Pamela Howard
""Designing and Drawing for the Theatre"" by Lynn Pecktal (comprehensive textbook with designer interviews)
""Alice Through the Proscenium"" by Clare Floyd DeVries (for step-by-step theater design process)
""American Set Design"" by Arnold Aronson and ""American Set Design II"" by Ronn Smith (for designer interviews and production photos)

,
Draw.,
Look for colleges or universities with degree programs in set design or technical theater.,
Look for design opportunities.,
Work hard.,
Document your work.",How to Learn Set Design for Theatre," The first step would be to search for books on set design, preferably ones that give step by step guidelines for design which a young designer can follow. As quickly as possible, find a more experienced designer or technical director to mentor you. Also listen to advice from stage carpenters, painters, and other theater folk. Gain experience with as many kinds of theatrical spaces and show types as you can. Continue to read and study about set design and building, but also about architecture, interior design, art, design history, etc. Set designers need a wide knowledge base. They also need some artistic skill, since drawing, painting, and (in model building) sculpture are the main ways to explain visual ideas. As your knowledge, experience, and skills increase, your set design will become stronger and faster.;
,, Keep a sketchbook with you and draw every day. Consider taking a life drawing or painting class. Talented designers do not have to have virtuoso drawing skills, but improving your ability helps you both to design and to present design ideas. Drawing is a designer's way of explaining. Many media are used: pencil, pen and ink, or computer drawings are common as are colored pencil, gouache or watercolor paintings, or computer renderings. Models are also important to explain scenic designs. These design ideas must finally be drafted to scale as construction drawings for the scene shop. Hand-drafting has been the standard method but, increasingly, computer drafting is taking over that role.

, Many fine designers, however, come to theater design by other routes. Those hiring a designer generally care more about previous work and reputation, than about a degree.

, Get involved with theater as a volunteer; expect to start small, assisting a set designer, working as a set dresser, or assisting a prop designer. Help paint and build sets. Many young designers get their start working with high schools, community theatres, and/or summer theatre companies. Most jobs will come through who you know and what you prove you can do, but some of these places post job listings online at websites such as Backstagejobs.com or on their own websites. Summer companies tend to recruit at regional conferences such as the ""Southeastern Theatre Conference"" (SETC) where companies can interview on mass for their summer season. There are also companies like Disney and Carnival Cruise that look for longer contracts if you're interested. These conferences also offer the opportunity for theatre professionals to network and share their craft.

, Don't wait for the job to start designing. Pick a play, read it, and design it. Non-realized or ""Paper"" projects may be what give you the chance to design a fully realized project.

, Never leave a project without making sure you have photos and/or drawings of your work and process to show your next potential client your talent.

Decide on a good time of year.,
Decide on the occasion.,
Get the community together.,
Decide who will be doing what.,
Keep the definition of street theater broad.,
Ask everyone to prepare their act.,
Check that everyone has all they need by way of props and costumes.,
Have some people involved in monitoring everyone's well-being on the day.,
Spread the word.,
Enjoy the event.",How to Hold Your Own Street Theater," The best time is when it's warm and the nights stay light for longer. Summer and early fall/autumn are ideal times.;
, You don't really need a reason other than to get your community on the street together but you might like to also turn it into an occasion for a street party or even to raise money for a charity concern that everyone in the street thinks is worthwhile. If there is a local disaster event, you might like to raise money to help people who are suffering the consequences of the disaster.

, Put flyers in everyone's mailbox to ask them to a general meeting to discuss having a street theater occasion (and perhaps a party accompanying it) and that you'd like people who are keen to come along. Let them know that you're looking for:


People to help set up and clear away
People to perform all sorts of street theater
People to prepare food and drink
People to come along.

, At the meeting, start planning as soon as you have adequate agreement from everyone to participate and to support the event.


Work out how you will control traffic on the street that day. You may need local authority permission to close off the street and you will need all neighbors to be in agreement about not moving their vehicles about in the area chosen. Another way is to call it street theater but to choose a large garden space or a park rather than holding up a street.
Talk early on about logistics, such as setting up a stage, acrobat areas, equipment, cooking facilities, and even portaloos, etc. if you expect people from other streets to come along.
Discuss funding and whether or not this is needed. It might be that everyone can donate all that is needed, plus their time and talent.

, You will want to encourage as many people as possible to participate, so allow as many types of ""theater"" as possible to form a part of this event. Some ideas include:


Acting performances
Singing, musical
Acrobatics
Juggling
Improvisation
Comedy acts, skits
Tricks, magic, body, object, etc.
Animal performances (pets only, and only welfare-compliant things)
Activist theater (explaining an important issue by acting - be sure to adopt a theme if this is your reason for the street theater)
Puppetry
Making things
Marching band
Bands of any kind
Miming, and more.

, Create a timetable if you're having more than one event, so that everyone gets to watch and be watched at different times.

, It might be a good idea to supply a makeshift changing room for people who need to make costume changes, etc.

, You will need people to run around doing all sorts of errands. Make sure they have cell phones in case of emergencies.

, Put up posters, send out flyers, and even advertise in the local paper and radio if you want more people to come and see what your street is doing.

, On the day, get out there and soak up the atmosphere, have a lot of fun and don't take it too seriously.

Research for inspiration.,
Decide what emotion you want to convey.,
Draw your design.",How to Make Greek Theatre Masks1," Before you start making your mask, first decide on a design. Use the Internet or books on Greek theater inspire ideas of what your mask could look like. You don’t have to base your own design on these examples, but they can guide you in the right direction if you don’t know where to start., You should choose a simple but clear expression to represent. You may decide to make a mask that is happy, sad, angry, excited, etc.If you are making the mask for a particular play, think about your character and the primary emotions they feel during the play.
Remember that you will be poking out eye holes, so make sure your design has large, open eyes.

, Once you have settled on a design, draw it on a piece of paper. Even though you won’t actually use this paper to make you mask, recording your design will help you to remember it exactly as you wanted it."
"
Create a mask from paper plates or card stock.,
Make a mask from paper mâché.,
Make a mask with plaster bandages.",How to Make Greek Theatre Masks2," Paper plates and card stock are the easiest materials to work with to make your mask. Cut out an oval shape in the material that mimics the shape of your face. Draw your design onto the material, and use a scissors to cut out the eyes and the mouth. Before drawing on the eyes and mouth, put the mask up to your face. With a pencil, make a mark where your eyes and mouth fall. Then draw the eyes and mouth over these marks and cut them out.

, You can also use paper mâché to build the mask around a balloon. First inflate a regular sized balloon and tie it. Take a couple strips of newspaper and dip them into the bowl of decoupage glue. Then stick them onto the balloon. Do this until you have two or three layers of newspaper in roughly the shape of a mask.Leave the paper mâché for a couple hours to let it dry. One it has dried, poke the balloon with a pin or other sharp object. Then peel the balloon away so you are left with just the mask.
Cut out the eyes and the mouth. Use a scissors to cut out the eye and mouth holes. If you cannot cut through the paper mâché with scissors, use an Exacto-knife to cut out the holes.

, By using plaster, you can mold the mask to your face so it fits perfectly. Before starting the mask, apply a layer of Vaseline around the edge of your face near your hairline, as well as over your eyebrows. Put small squares of dampened paper towel over your eyes. Then lie down and have a friend start layering on the plaster bandages by dipping them in water and putting them directly on your face. They should lay down around three layers of bandages.Make sure you friend keeps the eye and the mouth area open.
Peel off the mask and wash your face to get rid of any Vaseline or plaster.

"
"
Strengthen the mask.,
Create features.,
Color the mask.,
Add hair.,
Add elastic.",How to Make Greek Theatre Masks3," If you made your mask from paper mâché or bandages, you may want to reinforce your mask. If you notice any layers of the mask that poke out and interfere with the shape, trim them with scissors. Also use glue to reinforce layers that are peeling apart from each other., If you want you mask to look more realistic, add on to it to create features. If you used paper mâché you can add features like a nose by adding on more paper. You can also model features out of clay and paper mâché around them, then glue the features onto the mask.


If you made your mask from bandages, you can also put on new bandages if you want to exaggerate the shape of certain features or reinforce thin layers.

, Now that you are done making the basic shape of the mask, go ahead and color it as you wish! You may decide to paint a flesh tone over your whole mask, and then paint on features like lips or eyebrows. You can also go for bolder, non-traditional colors. Do whatever you feel like best suits your design.


If you have made the mask from card stock or paper plates, you can use crayons, markers or paint to color in the mask.
If you used paper mâché or bandages, you should paint your mask because crayons and markers won’t be as effective on these materials.

, Many Greek theater masks also included hair. If you are happy with the way your mask looks, you don’t have to add hair. However If you do want to add hair, use construction paper, wool, yarn, or whatever material you have available. Adding hair can make you mask look more realistic and human-like., Poke holes on the each side of the mask. String elastic through one of the holes, then tie the elastic to secure it. Do the same on the other side. Adding elastic allows you to wear your mask without holding it up so that you can use your hands freely. If you would prefer to hold your mask, attach a stick to the bottom so you can hold it more easily in front of your face.

Practice your craft.,
Find inspiration from great performers.,
Focus on your breathing before going on stage.,
Think positively.,
Eat and exercise.,
Meditate the day of your performance.,
Show up early.,
Choose colors that contrast the stage backdrop.,
Select flattering clothing.,
Dress slightly differently than the audience.,
Dress for comfort.,
Wear makeup.,
Cultivate your image.,
Have good posture on stage.,
Breathe deeply but naturally.,
Take the pressure out of your opening line.,
Use positive body language and facial expressions.,
Be energetic.,
Interact with the crowd.,
Notice where cameras are.",How to Look Good on Stage," Whatever you’re on stage performing, you should know it well. If you’re an actor, practice acting. If you’re a musician, practice your music. You may be naturally talented, but if you put in hard work, it will show!


Know the words to any lines you’ll be speaking. Memorize the lyrics to any songs you’ll be singing.
If you play an instrument, make sure you have the music memorized.;
, Watch performance videos of artists you admire. Observe their mannerisms. When they do something that is impressive or triggers positive emotions, try to figure out what about their presence is effective in those moments.


For example, does the artist come across as natural and believable? If so, why?
What does the performer do that shows emotional attachment to the lyrics, music or dialogue?

, This is a way to calm your nerves. Take deep breaths in and out. Don’t think about any stress or distractions - think about your breathing and calming your body down one part at a time as you inhale and exhale.

, It’s important for your self confidence that you don’t allow negative thinking to take hold. Know that if you do make a mistake, you can bounce back without letting it affect your positive outlook. Be secure and happy with who you are. You’re going on stage, so you clearly have talent!


For example, if a negative thought arises, counter it with a positive affirmation like “I will be successful.”

, Make sure that you eat before your performance to power you through it. Have carbohydrates like pasta or rice that are complex but still easily digestible. Physical exercise relieves stress, so try stretching or running in place before you perform., This is a great way to relieve stress. Find a quiet place. Sit in a comfortable position and imagine that you’re in a pleasant place. Clear your mind of any distractions and focus on your inner calm. Meditating before a performance can help ease your anxiety and improve your focus.Try gentle humming and playing relaxing music.

, This strategy can help you ward off stage fright. It’s better to be prepared than to feel rushed. Also it’s easier to feel in control if you are there when the audience is slowly filling up, rather than arriving to an already-seated crowd.


Know your place on the stage so that you won’t appear unsure when you make your entrance., You don’t want to blend into the backdrop. Try to find out what color it will be so that you can wear an opposite shade. If you can’t find out the backdrop color beforehand, bring multiple outfit choices.Avoid wearing black unless you’re certain that the backdrop will be very light.

, You want to wear something with visual interest, but not so much that it detracts from your performance. For example, If you want to wear something sparkly, stick to just one piece of clothing that has shimmer to it.Don’t wear pantyhose with sheen. The stage lights will reflect off them and make your legs appear bigger than they are.

, Consider dressing one level up from your audience. For instance, if you expect that your audience will be dressing casually, bump your look up to business casual. You may want to bring a backup outfit if you are unsure of how your audience will dress., You will be moving around on stage and you don’t want to look or feel uncomfortable in what you’re wearing. Think about preventing sweaty underarms as you select your outfits. The stage lights may be hot and their brightness can visually accentuate perspiration on your clothing.

, You may or may not want to apply makeup, depending on what type of performance it is. If you wear makeup normally, your stage makeup should be twice as dark as that. For males and females, use a liquid foundation and setting powder. Apply highlighter above your cheekbones, contouring below them, and wear blush. Apply eyeliner and eyeshadow as desired, but sparingly.The heavy makeup will look a bit garish under natural light but great under the stage lights.
Females may want to wear a brightly colored lipstick to stand out, a neutral lip, or a character-appropriate lip color. Avoid wearing a lot of black eyeliner, which can accentuate dark circles under-eye circles beneath the stage lights.Don’t apply a heavy foundation and nothing else, or you’ll appear too pale.

, Avoid trends and stick to timeless pieces. Keep your look consistent from event to event. If you’re part of a band, get the band together and come up with a theme or color scheme you will all stick to. For instance, you may want to pick specific patterns, patches, jewelry, or other accessories.If you’re part of a band, the entire band should be dressed for the spotlight, not just the lead singer.

, Take up space by standing up strong and straight. This will help you perform and look professional and confident.If you’re not holding an instrument or prop, keep your arms at your sides in a natural stance.Keep your head up and your chest open.

, Shallow, rapid breathing triggers the “fight or flight” response in your nervous system. By controlling your breathing, you can stimulate the opposite reaction.Take your time. Breathe normally and match the pace of your actions to your calm, regular breathing.

, If you’ll be speaking or singing on stage, a good trick to open naturally is to ask yourself a question in your mind that your opening line answers. Imagine that someone else has asked you the question, and your opening line is the response.For example, if you’re going to perform “America The Beautiful,” ask yourself in your head “Whose land is this?” Then start singing your answer, which is the opening line to the song: “This land is your land, this land is my land…”

, Feel happy and sincere when you smile. People can recognize a fake smile even from far off. Also, you don’t want photos of yourself performing with an insincere grin. Summon happy thoughts and match your expression to those emotions to smile naturally.Get into your performance so that your facial expressions will genuinely reflect the appropriate emotions. This can not only improve the way your audience views your performance, but it also improves the way people listen to a performance.Project your emotions by keeping your body language in tune with the movement of your performance. For example, if you’re expressing sincerity, you might hold your hand over your heart. If you’re being welcoming, you could gesture with your arms in the air as if you’re about to give someone a hug.

, Whatever you’re doing on stage, do it actively. Think of the people in the last row of the venue and how much energy is required to reach them.Also keep in your mind the meaning behind your performance piece, so that your energy matches it without being too little or too much.For example, if you’re singing, imagine that you’re singing to the person in the very last row. Project your voice and use sweeping gestures.
You want to be lively and have movement, but avoid fidgeting.

, Work on your stage presence. You don’t want to spend your performance staring at a microphone or instrument, looking at the floor, or closing your eyes. Connect with your audience by making eye contact with people in the crowd, if you can see them. If the stage lights are so bright that you can’t see the audience well, span your gaze in their direction.Don’t stay in one place if you don’t have to. Move around the stage, such as coming up to the front of the stage nearer to the audience.Face your audience with the mindset that you are pleased to see them. They showed up for the performance, so you want them to feel appreciated!

, Be aware of where photographers are located so that you can incorporate subtle poses into your performance. Look at the photographer and give the camera a glance, wink, smile or pose for several seconds at a time. This should appear seamless so that the rest of your audience doesn’t realize that you’re doing it.You don’t want it to be obvious to the crowd that you’re mugging for the cameras. Do this as naturally and subtly as possible.

You're definitely not going to want to be rushed or showing up late to a Broadway performance.

, Look nice, as a Broadway show is a special event. Just make sure your dress clothes are comfortable, though—you don't want to be miserable during a long show! It's a good idea to dress in layers so you can adjust for being too hot or too cold in the theater.


Casual business attire is considered appropriate for most plays. While it's possible that some attending the theater may wear jeans or casual shorts, this would not be considered the most appropriate of attire.

Sit in the center two-thirds back.,
Sit at the best viewing angle.,
Get a good seat in a home theater.",How to Get the Best Seat in a Movie Theater1," In order to get the best sound quality, you should sit where the sound technician sits to calibrate the experience. This is the most common way to get a good seat.


That means you should plant yourself two-thirds of the way toward the back of the theater, right in the middle. In terms of viewing, most seats in modern stadium theaters are 12-to-15 inches higher than the seats in front of them, allowing for unobstructed viewing. That’s why choosing where you sit based on sound is a good idea.Experts recommend that you sit slightly off center to amplify the effect of the sound. Try sitting one or two seats from the dead center of the theater, two-thirds back. You will have a “dynamic, stereo sound” from this position.
This phenomenon is widely known. The sound is going to be sharper – and you will get the full effect of it - in this spot.;
, Almost all movie theaters have a spot where the visuals and audio will be best. You want to find that “sweet spot.”By some standards, a 36-degree viewing angle from the farthest seat in the theater is the best place to sit. You want the viewing angle to be maximum. People have even applied complex mathematical equations to this question!
The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers has a visual guideline that advises that the vertical line of sight of the viewer should not be more than 35 degrees from the horizontal to the top of the projected images.
The ideal sight line should be 15 degrees beneath the horizontal center line of the projected image on the screen. To feel more immersed in the action, sit in the row where the screen’s edges are just inside your peripheral vision's edges., Home theaters are no different than other movie theaters: There are ways to maximize the viewing experience.


The optimal viewing distance is the size of your screen’s diagonal measurement divided by .84. That means that a 44-inch set should be viewed at 5.4 feet. This is the THX home theater standard.
THX recommended viewing distances for a 60-inch TV are 6 to 9 feet.
The style of cinematography can also affect how far away you should sit from the screen because some movies were designed to be shown on very large screens.

"
"
Buy tickets online.,
Reserve your seat.,
Get there early.",How to Get the Best Seat in a Movie Theater2," Many movie theaters have it set up now so that you can easily buy your tickets online with a credit card. Check on the theater's website.


This will allow you to evade long lines for popular movies, thus getting into the theater ahead of other people to choose the best seats.
Some dinner theaters allow you to actually select your seats. Some regular theater seat selections are first-come first-serve, though, but buying them online means you can skip the lines and get into the theater sooner before the choice seats are snapped up.
Buying tickets online also eliminates the chances you will arrive to a sold-out show.

, You could purchase reserved seats online, depending on the theater. They usually cost a little bit more (a few dollars), but they guarantee you a good seat.


You could also buy a reserved seat at the theater. Reserved seats are often more comfortable and are larger recliners too. Most larger theaters sell reserved seats, although some small ones may not.
The reserved seats are usually positioned toward the back of the theater where sound is best, and you don’t have to crane your neck to see the film. They sometimes have bigger tables to hold your concessions.
You are often allowed to select your own reserved seat or the computer will select the best seat available for you. This way if you arrive late or last minute, you won’t have to worry about ending up in the first row in a crowded theater.

, This sounds pretty obvious, but if you want to get the best seat, don’t show up right as the movie is about to start unless you have a reserved seat.


Get there at least 15 to 20 minutes early, and maybe more if it’s a super popular showing.
The other thing you could do it go on off-times. Some movie theaters have weekday deals.
Friday and Saturday night showings of popular new movies are going to be the most crowded.

"
"
Go on Mondays and Wednesdays.,
Consider your personal needs.,
Go early or late.",How to Get the Best Seat in a Movie Theater3," These weekdays are considered the lowest traffic movie days, so if you want to avoid the crowds, go then. Avoiding crowds means you will have your choice of seats.


Holidays can see spikes in traffic. If you don’t want to fight the crowds for the best movie theater seats, avoid showings around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The last evening showing on Monday or Wednesday will be the emptiest theater yet in most cases.You could also wait until a popular new movie has been out for awhile. That way you can avoid the crush, and settle into the best seat in the house instead of battling someone else for it. You could also check out smaller chains or budget theaters.

, The best seat might not be the seat that allows you to hear or see best if it means you will be uncomfortable.


An aisle seat will be better if you are going to have to take several restroom breaks during the showing (or if you are with a child who might).
Similarly, if you plan to run back and forth for concessions, you’re going to annoy a lot of people by constantly tripping over them on your way out of the middle.
If you end up with a middle back seat, plan to feel pretty crammed if the movie is popular, with people on either side of you. If you are very tall with long legs, you might prefer sitting in the middle seats that open onto the aisle so your legs aren’t as cramped., The time you go to the theater is going to make a big difference when it comes to theater audience size.


The last showing of the evening is less likely to be full, unless it’s a blockbuster on opening night, of course.
Matinee showings have the added benefit of being cheaper. Not only will you save a few dollars, but you will also not have to face crowds and will have a better chance of getting the optimal seats.
Be aware that theaters can fill up on off times when there are special promotions, such as senior citizen days or discount days for teachers or students.

Find some people who are interested.,
Pick a scene you want to do.,
Focus on your part.,
Get props and costumes together.,
Rehearse.,
Perform!",How to Do a Tableau," Try your local theater or drama club. It would be best to recruit actors if you want to do this in public, since a tableau requires expressive positioning and realistic facial expressions. But if you just want to have fun, doing it with your friends would be the best option.
, Focus on the limitations of tableau--Hamlet's ""To Be or Not To Be"" speech is an especially moving moment in literature, but without any words, you would just see Hamlet with his mouth open. Scenes involving action are best, especially if what is happening is complex and might be missed in a movie. (e.g. a war scene with large armies) The audience should be able to get at least a rough idea of what was happening before your scene and what will happen after., What are you specifically doing? Remember that the audience must be able to tell what you are doing because you can't tell them through motion or speaking. Exaggerate the action as much as you can without being cheesy. Since you can't see yourself, ask for feedback from your friends or those around you., Props and costumes are especially important to tableau. These tell the audience who is who (the king has a crown) and what's going on (light sabers out = a tense moment, a battle is about to take place). If your tableau is not taking place in a normal world (ex: Wonderland), then you should assemble a set as well., This is when you find out what works and what doesn't. Correct any problems you come across. If you find making eye contact with someone makes you laugh, for example, try looking at their forehead instead. This is a good time to discover how long you can hold your position, and hence how long the tableau should be. Train yourself to stay still in your position (don't fiddle with your belt, even if you don't think the audience will notice). You might bring in small audiences to give suggestions before the real performance., Remember, the best evaluation of your tableau is if you had fun while making it."

Start with some lessons.,
Practice a lot.,
Get in shape.,
Cultivate a community of musical performers.",How to Get Into Musical Theatre1," Musical theatre involves singing, acting, and dancing. If you have trouble with any of these areas, look into lessons in your local area. Teachers post ads in places like newspapers and local magazines. These lessons can also be put on your resume. This will help you look more experienced.


Choose to work with people who have succeeded themselves in musical theatre or have taught people that went on to see their names in lights.;
, Even after you’ve finished your formal training, you’ll need to keep practicing, learning new skills, and remaining limber. Sing new songs. Learn new dances. Join community musical productions. They’ll be great experience. You can use these experiences to try out new skills.

, In many musical theatre performances, you’ll need to move around a lot, either on stage or off stage. You might be dancing choreographed masterpieces. No matter what, you need to be in shape. Do a lot of cardio exercises like running, jump roping, and swimming. It is important to have a lot of stamina to both move and sing at the same time., It is so important to join other aspiring actors, singers, and dancers. Not only will you pick up advice on your craft, but you can rely on one another to hear about auditions. They will be great moral support as well.

"
"
Think strategically about your audition materials.,
Prepare a monologue.,
Practice dancing.,
Film yourself.",How to Get Into Musical Theatre2," Try to match the style of your audition piece to the style of the musical you're auditioning for. There are different kinds of musicals. For example, RENT is a rock musical. If you were auditioning for RENT, you would not want to sing a classical ballad or a country song. Keep with the theme. Sing something from Jesus Christ Superstar or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.


Never audition with a piece from a show that the company has done in the past 5 years. They'll compare you with whoever did it in their production. They are working on something new and don’t want to just replicate a past performer.
When auditioning, try to avoid songs that have been over sung, are too well known, or are too complex. You don’t want to be perceived as a novice. People in the theatre want performers that have an in-depth knowledge of theatre.Some commonly overdone songs are ""Tomorrow"" or ""Maybe"" from Annie, ""Memory"" from Cats, ""Favorite Things"" from The Sound of Music, any songs from Wicked, Phantom of the Opera or Les Miserables,""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz, ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" from Funny Girl, ""Shy"" from Once Upon a Mattress, ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"" from Flower Drum Song, ""Seasons of Love"" from RENT, or ""In My Own Little Corner"" from Cinderella.
Disney films are great but not for auditions. Avoid using songs from Disney films.
Do not sing anything made famous by a well known Broadway artist (""Taylor the Latte Boy"" being a perfect example)
Think carefully about a piece involving extensive profanity or innuendo.

, Musicals aren’t all about music. In most musicals, you’ll have to go back and forth between singing and acting. Be prepared to show both skills. Don’t choose monologues that have been overdone. Producers, directors, and casting crew enjoy being surprised by monologue choices. If you choose a common one, they may not pay close attention to your prepared piece.Keep your monologue to under 2 minutes long. You want to be able to show a range of emotions in a short amount of time. The casting crew will be viewing dozens of people for this part and others. If they want something longer, they’ll ask for it.
Choose a monologue from a play or a movie. Most monologues in musicals are used to set up songs, so they normally aren’t as developed as ones in plays or movies.
Avoid monologues with really obscene language or gestures, thick accents, or too much movement. You want to emphasize your acting chops, not your ability to offend. Exceptions exist. You’ll want to gauge the tone of the musical you are auditioning for when prepping. If it is a raunchy musical, an unconventional and crass monologue may be a good choice., If there is a dancing portion of the musical, the audition will be run like a class. They’ll teach you the dance and then ask you to perform it. Regardless, you should practice a variety of dances. Learn new dances frequently. You’ll get better at learning dances quickly., Put your audition monologue and songs on tape before you audition. Then watch them. Just like athletes, you'll want to watch your performance, analyze it, and fix any errors or odd transitions. Look for strange body language, facial expressions, or speech abnormalities.


In your audition pieces, make sure you have an equal balance of facial expressions, hand gestures, and movement. It's great that you're using your hands to tell the story, but it won't impress anyone if your face looks like you're falling asleep. Keep every part of your body alert and in control."

Find and schedule an audition.,
Dress the part.,
Prepare your song, monologue, and dance.,
Audition.,
Brace yourself for “rejection”.,
Show up with a smile on your face and your best foot forward.",How to Get Into Musical Theatre3," You should always book an audition time unless otherwise specified. Most contact information for booking auditions will be either on the company's website or in a newspaper advertisement., Dress nicely for your audition. How you present yourself is key. Sometimes, you may wish to wear a costume. Help the casting crew to see you in the role, but don’t go so over the top that your costume takes away from your performance. Stay away from props., Most groups will tell you what they want you to do for the audition. Generally, they'll want a song that fits your voice range and age (always from a musical), and a short 1 or 2 minute monologue.

, Auditioning can be a nerve-racking experience for the first few times. There are different kinds of auditions.


There are open auditions. This is where you audition for everyone - the director, the music director, any other board members, and the other people auditioning.
There is also a closed audition where you are only auditioning for the director, and the music director.

, Every position is different and the director/producer have a specific image in mind. Go in. Do your best. If you don’t get it, most likely it isn’t anything you did.

, Be polite. Don’t be arrogant. Make good impressions. Just watch what you say and who you say it to. If they like your personality, they may think of you for a different part, perhaps, in a different production.


Do not get caught up in drama. Trash talking people in the theatre community will get you nowhere but a seat in the audience. Approach your experiences with an open mind and optimistic conscience. It will get you far.

"
Attend a college or conservatory.,
Make connections.,
Create a resume and portfolio.,
Get an agent.,
Serve your time in the trenches.",How to Get Into Musical Theatre4," Especially if you want to make musical theatre your profession, this is necessary. Many people talk about “raw” natural talent. There is no substitute for it, but you still need to refine that talent. Majoring in theatre in college will give you a well-rounded education, which can help you get into musical theatre, but also several other jobs associated with the stage.Conservatories focus on refining specific skills like singing, dancing, acting, and playing instruments.While in college or the conservatory, think about what skills will set you apart as a performer. Who knows what skills a producer will want, so it is best to have knowledge of a variety of traditional and non-traditional performing skills. Steve Martin is a comedian, but he often uses a banjo for comedic purposes. If you can play the banjo and you go our for a musical version of Huckleberry Finn (like Roger Miller’s “King of the Road”), you’ll have a heads up on other performers without that skill. It is much easier to play a banjo than to successfully mime playing one.

, Getting connections is also part of your training. Yes, it's clichéd, but knowing the right people in the right way is important. Get an idea of who's a big deal and who's not. Then attend shows and after parties where those people are bound to be. Play it cool. Complement their shows. Highlight what you have in common or how you might be able to help them. Overtime, these connections can result in more auditions and jobs.

, Like any job, having a well laid out, detailed resume will make you look more professional.


Start with your name and basic information such as your phone number, email, address, and date of birth. You may also wish to include your vocal range (e.g. Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in this section.
Next, include a list of what previous productions you've been in. This format should include the name of the production, the company that put it on, where and when it was, and what your role in the production was. Next you should include any training you've done or relevant extra-curricular activities such as vocal lessons, dance lessons, acting lessons, gymnastics, and instruments you play. You will need to also put who your teacher was or the company you did it with.
Think about your digital presence also. Include your Twitter handle, Facebook name, and personal website (if you have one). With so many personalities and musicians hitting it big on Youtube, producers pay close attention to the online presence of their performers. If you have a big following online too that could translate into more theatre goers, producers may be further intrigued by you., Most people think that agents only deal with big Hollywood stars. This isn't true. Agents are paid to be in the loop and to have connections. While you can develop these connections over time socially, it might pay to expedite the process. Agents can get you into more auditions. They can help get you more exposure as well, which might translate to musical theatre jobs down the line. When getting an agent, pay attention to whom they've worked with. Make sure that they aren't just going to take your money and not work for you.

, Whether you're looking for your big break or your first lead role, you have to wait to get it. It takes a couple of shows before you finally begin to get recognized by people in the theatre community. If you wait and are patient, not only will you have a larger resumé, but you'll be a better actor/actress for it!

Choose a role that you’re comfortable with.,
Memorize your material.,
Pick the right monologue or song.,
Choose someone to perform with.",How to Get a Part in a School Play1," Read through the script thoroughly to decide which part would be the most fun and rewarding for you.


Think about what role falls within your ability; if you want the lead role, but that part has a large number of lines and you don’t have the time to rehearse or have difficulty memorizing, then that part may not be right for you.
Consider what role will have the most competition from other students auditioning for the play. Try for the lead role(s) if you want to be up against many others, or try a smaller part that not as many people audition for a greater chance at getting it.
Also be prepared for the chance that you won’t have the ability to pick a particular role, and will simply audition first before you are assigned to a part.;
, Pick your scene, monologue, or song and memorize it thoroughly so that you can perform it easily without reading off of a page.


Sometimes it’s perfectly acceptable to have the script with you at your audition to consult, but it always helps to memorize to the best of your ability so you don't sound like you're reading from it.
Give yourself plenty of time to commit the material to memory. Practice for an hour or two at a time, then leave it and go do something else or get a good night’s sleep before you return to it.

, If you’re asked to choose a monologue or song that’s not from the play itself, choose something that’s comfortable, age-appropriate, and within the given time limit (usually two to three minutes).


Prepare two different monologues or songs if you can. Memorize a serious speaking part as well as a comedic one, and choose a ballad to sing as well as a lighter up-tempo song.
Choose a monologue that’s about one minute long, and/or a section of a song that is 16 or 32 bars long., Find a friend or another student interested in auditioning for the play to help you rehearse a scene if you plan to audition with material that involves more than one character or vocalist.


It may help to choose someone who is confident and a good actor, as he or she will help influence your own confidence and ability, both in rehearsals and during the audition if you can or want to audition with them too.
Make sure the same person is available to rehearse when and as much as you need to, or that you have several people or backups to help you out when one person can’t.

"
"
Read and re-read the script.,
Chat with the director.,
Rehearse your material.,
Warm up your voice.",How to Get a Part in a School Play2," Get very familiar with the script for the entire play, not just the lines for your role or the individual scene you use to audition. Read the whole script more than once if you can.


Research elements of the character, setting, or themes that you don’t understand or you’d like to know better. Getting immersed in the world of the play can make all the difference in auditioning well.
Focus on learning the pronunciation and meaning of any words you don’t know in the script, especially in a scene you plan to audition with, or another monologue not from the play.

, Introduce yourself to the director of the play before you even rehearse; it may help you be more memorable when he or she sees you again at the audition and makes a decision on who to cast.


Be friendly and keep your conversation quick and casual. Ask questions about the play in order to show your interest and possibly get more information about the script and setting than you would just from reading it.

, Perform your scene, monologue, or song as you will during the audition and would during the play itself when you’re in front of many people. Rehearse as many times leading up to the audition as you need to feel comfortable performing it.


Try getting different types of audiences to watch your performance, not just your family and close friends. Ask audiences to give you constructive feedback if they can.
Make sure you replicate the conditions of your audition as best as possible while you rehearse. For instance, if you will have a piano player or other accompanist playing during your audition song, make sure you rehearse with someone who can play the piece to accompany you. You might even rehearse in the auditorium or room you’ll actually audition in.

, Get your vocal muscles warm and flexible right before your speak or sing in your addition to avoid a cracking, wavering, or croaking voice.


Slide through a musical scale if you’re preparing to audition with a song, or try a basic vocal warm-up, like trilling your tongue, buzzing your lips, or repeating different consonant or vowel sounds as you hum different notes.Try drinking some warm water with honey or lemon, but in general avoid eating or drinking anything but water right before your audition."
"
Shake off your nerves.,
Introduce your material.,
Enunciate and project.,
Speak in context of the play.,
Be flexible.,
Don’t be afraid to give it your all.",How to Get a Part in a School Play3," Distract yourself from your nervous energy before and during an audition by breathing deeply or any other method you use to deal with nerves or anxiety.


Many people find that their nerves are worse leading up to the audition, but dissipate when they actually get on stage and start. Try having a small snack, chatting with others quietly backstage, and thinking about other things besides the audition while you’re waiting to go on.Remember that it’s okay to get nervous! Almost everyone gets some level of stage fright, and it’s helpful to remember that the people judging your audition are on your side and want to see you succeed.

, Explain what you’ll be reading or singing from for your audition, as well as your name and any other information the director would like to hear from your before you begin. This is called your 'slate'.


Avoid launching straight into your performance as soon as you get onstage. It benefits you to have a few moments to collect yourself first, and it benefits the director to see a little bit of your personality before you get into acting the part.Remember to give your sheet music to the accompanist if applicable for performing a song. Tell him or her what tempo you’d like the music to be played at, and give them a distinct nod when you’re ready to begin., Speak your words clearly, slowly, and loudly to command the attention of the director and audition panel, and show them that you could be heard by a large audience during a live show.


Avoid rushing through the material at all costs. It’s tempting to try to get through your lines quickly if you’re nervous, but showing patience and giving yourself time to immerse into your character displays maturity and a better grasp of the material.
Try to create as much change or variation in your short performance as possible, varying the mood, speed, and tone of your words when appropriate to help tell a story in a small amount of time.Focus on projection in particular when auditioning for a musical role. It’s important to show that your singing voice is powerful and can be heard throughout an auditorium.

, Remember that while you are focusing on your own lines, you need to interact and respond to other characters or surroundings that will be present in the real performance.


Even if you’re performing a monologue, imagine the lines that come before it, or the circumstances that brought your character to this moment, before you begin performing it.If you’re performing a song, you can still tell a story with the lyrics and mood. Think about what the significance of this song is for the character singing it or for the storyline as a whole.
Remember to react to the environment of the setting as well. While delivering your lines, would your character be hot, cold, uncomfortable, at ease? If you can’t get clues about what the environment would be like from the script, simply make sure to move around the stage., Respond with a second monologue, song, or other material you have prepared or can quickly reference in the script if the director asks you to perform something else.


Listen carefully to what the director wants you to do. Following directions and being prepared to perform different types of material will display a good attitude and ethic for rehearsals if you get selected for a role.Be prepared to read for several parts, not just the one you want most. The director may have a different idea in mind for a role you’d do well in.

, Give the audition all of your energy and enthusiasm. Don’t hesitate to get fully into the part. Being a character different from yourself is fun!


It’s always easier for a director to help an actor tone down over-acting than to coax out more expression, so don’t be afraid to be a little extra dramatic and expressive.
Remember to smile and have fun! Show that you love to perform and are enthusiastic about getting a part in the production. If the material you perform is meant to be serious, still make sure to smile and be expressive before and after the performance.

, This will help you understand the plot and characters better, which will benefit your portrayal for the dreaded cold reading.

, Maybe something funny or a song that you think not many people would sing. But make sure it's a song that shows off your voice. Don't be afraid to be dramatic- when you express yourself and the character you are in the song, it helps the director see your acting skills!

, Try to sing it as much as you can. To overcome nervousness, sing it in front of your parents, siblings, or even your pet!Just make sure that by the time of the audition, you have as much experience in singing the song as possible.

, Read through the cold read script quickly and try to imagine how that character would really feel. Portray that into your acting.

, Don't be upset if you don't get a huge part. Remember: There are no small parts, only small actors. So don't be a small actor and ROCK it! The more experience you get, the better chance you have at later auditions. Good luck!

Research your local theater online.,
Call and speak to a staff member.,
Visit in-person.",How to Get Involved in Community Theater1," Like most things, the first step to getting involved is getting informed and the internet is a great place to start. Take some time to browse your nearby theater's website, if they have one,and read about their mission state, what shows they are casting, if they have crew openings, if they are holding audition, or are in need of donations., They can help direct you and suggest whom to speak with further either by email, phone, or in-person.

, Chances are you’ve already visited the theater before as a patron, but if not plan on checking out a show. Stick around after the show, too, and see if you can chat up current cast members. This is a good way to get a vibe of the troupe and get tips or pointers from someone already in the know.

Write your play.,
Plan.,
Get the word out.,
Make a form for actors to fill out: again, type this or have your parent type this.,
Cast your play: you can choose to have open auditions, where other actors and parents can watch the auditions, or closed auditions, where it's just a one-on-one, director and actor, for each person.,
Take notes on the audition.,
Send out the cast list.,
Rehearse.,
Design and make props, costumes, and sets.,
Have a couple dress rehearsals where everyone is in costume, using props and sets.

,
Make playbills.,
Show others your amazing play!

",How to Direct a Kid Play," If you don't feel comfortable writing your own storyline, try adapting a book or movie, or putting a twist on one. Remember to write in script format! Type it on a word program on the computer and save it, or have a parent type it and save it. Make sure you have plenty of roles, or characters!;
, Get a piece of paper and a pen, then sit down where it's easy to think. Think about the play, the setting, the characters, etc. and get an idea of what your play will look like: think about what kinds of props, sets, and costumes you will need, how many actors/actresses you will need, what kind of people you want in the roles.

, Let people know about it so that you can hold auditions: send out emails or have a parent send out emails, give fliers out to neighbors and friends, tell your teachers at school. Remember to tell everyone that this will be produced and presented by kids only!

, It should include contact information (actor's name, parent's name, address, phone number, email address) as well as their height. If they have any experience with acting, make sure there's a space where they can say that! You might want to have the performers or the performer's parents help out with backstage things such as props, sets, and costumes: in that case, provide a spot where they can say how they can help.

, Try doing a group reading and a monologue reading at your audition. The group reading would be a scene or part of a scene from your play for everyone to perform. Another option for a group reading is to have the actors split into groups and do more than one reading. The monologue reading would be best optional. An actor wishing to do it should find a monologue (paragraph from a play or book that has a single speaker and opportunity for dramatic interpretation. In the case of a book, it should be first person) and present it to the director.

, Look at how each actor portrays the character: notice their voice, their body language, their expressions, everything. Also see who has a good, positive attitude, who follows your orders, and who is friendly towards the other actors. Use these notes to help decide your casting: as well as someone who is a good actor, you want someone cooperative in the main roles. The last thing you need is a bunch of stuck-up stars! Once you have decided the main roles, place people in the smaller roles and ensemble, or supporting cast. A good ground rule for these roles is to have the older actors have the larger roles in the ensemble.

, Try typing it and emailing it. Set times for the various roles to rehearse: have people in certain scenes come at different times. Be aware that sometimes people will have conflicts.

, If you can, rehearse at the place where you'll be putting the show on. If not, use a large room such as an empty basement. If the weather's nice, feel free to rehearse outdoors: however, always have a backup plan if it starts to rain or gets cold. You'll need to do blocking: that is, decide where everyone will stand, how and where people will move, where set pieces will be, etc. Also, don't be afraid to give your actors tips. Make sure you stay calm during rehearsals!

, You can have other actors and/or parents help you with this. Keep in mind your setting and characters. Try hunting through old dress-up clothes and Halloween costumes, and go to craft stores. Look for items in your house, too! You can also ask the actors to contribute items for their costumes or props. For sets, try painting old sheets for backdrops. Use fabrics and decorations to transform furniture into trees, plants, buildings, whatever you want.

,, These are programs for the play that show the names of all the actors and the roles they play. Make sure you include all roles, as well as everyone who helped backstage! Also, double-check that everyone's name is spelled right- try looking back at your audition forms. Don't forget to give yourself a credit in the playbill, for all your hard work writing and directing!

Nail the audition.,
Follow up after the audition.",How to Get Involved in Community Theater2," Sure, auditions can be intimidating, but here are some pointers to help take the stress out of the process and to help you nail it.If you're interested in getting involved, but not into acting, skip ahead to Method 3 for tips on how to get involved off-stage.


Some pre-work goes into arranging for an audition, and being organized with your schedule is always a good initial start.
If you have to call ahead to place an audition time, do so early to make sure there will be space for you.
Make sure you write down the correct time and place for the audition, plan to arrive 10 minutes earlier than the appointment time. Early arrival looks professional.

, Think about taking a couple of basic acting or improve classes before you dive into auditions. How to Prepare for a Theater Audition


If you are supposed to prepare a song, scene, or monologue do so. Regardless of whether you have to prepare something or not, do familiarize yourself with the play or musical you're auditioning for. Nothing looks worse than walking into an audition knowing nothing about the show!
If you weren't told to prepare anything, chances are you'll be doing a “cold read.” This means you will be given a song or scene and a few minutes to look over it before you have to perform it for the casting directors.Chances are you won't feel comfortable with the material. This is normal. Directors are testing how well you work under pressure. Just do your best and know you don't have to be perfect!

, Be fearless and do your best! How to Audition for Local Theater


Dress professionally, but also with personal style. Part of what you're ""selling"" on stage is yourself and your own unique personality. Show it off with your clothing!
Sing loud and proud, even if you don't think you sound good, confidence can speak just as loudly as talent. Read the lines with emotion and feeling, and if you are dancing, smile and sell it, even if you don't know all the moves.
Always be respectful to everyone at the audition, even if you're just waiting to go audition. Be nice to the directors, especially. Your attitude may determine whether or not they want to work with you and cast you in the show.

, A few days after auditions, there may be callbacks, or a second round of auditions. If you are called back, congratulations!, the directors want to see you again and may be interested in casting you.


You will be reading for specific parts during callbacks, so try to act as if you think your character would. If you are not called back, it’s okay, there’s always another play.
Check the cast lists when they're ready. A few days after callbacks, cast lists are usually posted. This is a list setting out who is playing each part. The list may be emailed to you, you could receive a call, or it might be posted somewhere at the theater.
If you have been cast, congratulations!, getting cast in a show is very excited, so give yourself a pat on the back. Be sure to let the director know in a timely fashion that you accept the role so that they don't give it to someone else! If you haven't been cast, don't worry, there will always be other plays, or maybe consider joining the crew.

Help out the backstage crew.,
Join the administrative staff.,
Volunteer to be an usher.,
Work in the box office.",How to Get Involved in Community Theater3," Most of the action actually happens behind the theater curtains and working offstage is an exciting way to get involved, especially if you’re shy or not really into acting. Every job is important backstage. The show couldn't go on without its crew members.


If you are interested in costumes, props, sets, lighting, or stage directing, seek out those involved in these crew departments and offer to lend a hand or any expertise and skills you might have. Being an electrician in your daily life, for example, will make you an excellent resource for the lighting crew.
If you are given a job in an area you rarely work in, follow the lead of whoever is in charge and help out as best you can. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

, Theaters have various administrative duties that may require volunteers. Check to see if your local theater needs a hand in their fundraising, marketing, public relations, or community outreach efforts. These are great ways to meet your neighbors and forge new connections outside of the theater, too.

, In many ways, ushers are the public ambassadors of the theater. If you like interacting with people, smiling, and helping out, you’d do great at this very important job., If you have strong multi-tasking skills, this could be a great job for you. Plus, you get to interact with the patrons while offering a service that has a big impact on the theater-going experience."

Become a financial supporter.,
Donate furniture.,
Join the board.",How to Get Involved in Community Theater4," Giving the theater a monetary donation, if you have the financial means, can be a mutually rewarding experience. Not only does it help the theater cover their overhead expenses and put on more shows, but it’s a way for you to get involved and to make a charitable donation that are likely tax deductible.Everyone's a winner!

, Theaters are almost always looking for set and prop donations. If you happen to have old furniture around, or something you think could be useful onstage, ask about bringing them over., Many theaters have a board that includes community representatives.See if your local theater has a board that you can join and help in the daily running of the theater.

Enjoy cast parties.,
Reap health benefits.,
Get discovered.",How to Get Involved in Community Theater5," One of the best parts of being involved in community theater is meeting new people and making new friends. After the final performance of a show, the cast and crew often throw a closing or ""wrap"" party to celebrate all the hard work you put into the show and all the camaraderie you've built while doing so.

, Studies have shown that getting involved with acting and improve can actually help to reduce work, school, and other life-related stress.

, DO NOT cast people you know personally, unless they happen to audition well. Make a list of those you would like to see again. I suggest calling everyone back, including those with whom you were undecided.

, Don't worry about acting now. Have all the actors and technical staff introduce themselves to everyone. Explain that they are welcome to bring their problems or questions to you.

, That way the actors know what exists and what is total emptiness.

, Do feel free to offer examples of acting choices, depending on what the script calls for. If a scene is not working right, you may adjust.

,, You don't want a scene ruined after a character kills himself onstage, making the actor try to stay as still as possible, while the lights have been left on for five minutes by mistake!

Read the script more than once.,
Become familiar with your character's world.,
Think in terms of objectives instead of feelings.,
Try to avoid stereotypes.,
Rehearse.",How to Develop a Character for Theatre1," Read the whole script at least once. Read the prologue, epilogue, the stage directions, and your lines as well as the other characters’ lines. As you read the script for the second and third time, highlight your lines and any important information given about your character.Highlight information about your character’s age, where they live, their name and upbringing, likes and dislikes, friends, family, favorite foods and places, as well as their political and religious viewpoints.
You may be able to find this information through your character’s and other characters’ lines, as well as context clues.;
, Contextualize your character by researching or imagining the time period your character is living in. Identify or imagine the culture and politics of the time period, as well as the politics of the city, town, or village they reside in. Additionally, think about how the gender, age, race or ethnicity, and class position of your character affects their relationship with the time period.For example, if your character is a female teacher in the early 1900s in New York City, it may be helpful to think about the gender politics of the time period and how this affects your character’s morals, aspirations, and convictions.
If you are playing a character in the future, it would be helpful to read or watch futuristic books and movies. This way you can get a general idea about how a society's culture and politics can evolve, and the effects it can have on a character's morals and aspirations.

, Playing emotions can come off as insincere and superficial. Therefore, instead of thinking about how the character feels, think about the character’s objectives or motivations. By thinking about the character’s objectives or motivations, you can create the desired and appropriate emotions.For example, instead of playing how disappointed your character is, think about why your character is disappointed. Your character may have just lost a very important competition that would have enabled them to fund their college tuition.

, If you are playing a grandmother, for example, do not automatically act enfeebled or out of the loop, or talk with a quivering voice. Instead, use the character’s backstory to develop the character. Think about how and why your character may have certain traits and not others., Memorizing your lines can only get you so far. You will need to rehearse your lines out loud to yourself multiple times in order to fully develop your character. Once you have rehearsed with yourself, rehearse in front of different audiences as well.Reading your lines out loud will also help you develop your character’s pitch and tone of voice, as well as their dialect.
Ask your audience for feedback, for example, “Is my accent too strong or not strong enough?” and “Does the tone of my voice fit the mood of the scene, or does it fit my character’s demeanor?”

"
"
Identify the physical qualities of your character.,
Establish your character's social status.,
Identify your character’s psychological qualities.,
Experiment with your character’s moral qualities.",How to Develop a Character for Theatre2," On a sheet of paper write down your character’s gender, sexuality, age, health status, height, weight, complexion, hair, mannerisms, posture, and type of clothing. When you are rehearsing, use these qualities to create an accurate representation of your character. Ask yourself:“Who am I, what is my name and do I like my name?”
“What is my gender and sexual orientation, and how do I feel about them?”
“How old am I and what do I think about my age?”
“What is my complexion and do I like it?”
“Do I have any deformities or handicaps, and if I do, how do I feel about them?”
“What is the volume, tempo, and pitch of my voice?” “How do I feel about it?”
“How does my posture reflect my age, health status, and inner feelings?”

, Ask yourself questions about your character's relationship to their environment and society, upbringing, social status, as well as their likes and dislikes. Then imagine or draw your character in different scenes and how they would act depending on their social status. This way, when you rehearse, you can use these sketches as references. Ask yourself questions like:“What was my childhood like?” “What were the best or worst memories?”
“Who were my parents and what did they do for a living?”
“What is my educational background?” and “Am I intelligent?”
“How much money do I have, or how much do I want?”
“What are my political and religious views?”
“What is my job and do I like it?”

, Becoming familiar with your character’s psychological qualities will help you develop appropriate responses and reactions to different scenarios. Imagine different scenarios and act out how your character would respond based upon their personality. For example, act out how your character would respond to their wallet being stolen. Become familiar with your character's personality by asking yourself:“What choices am I faced with and which ones do I make?”
“What are my ambitions or goals?”
“What makes me angry, sad, or happy?” or “What relaxes me?”
“Do people generally like me?” and “Why or why not?”
“Are any of my psychological traits manifested verbally or physically?”
“What are my fears?” or “What do I worry about?”

, Identify your character's ethics and morals. This will give you a more in depth understanding of your character. Then think of other characters that are similar to the one you are playing. Review movie or TV scenes the character is in and use them as a reference while you rehearse for your character. Ask yourself these questions about your character:“Who do I admire?”
“What is my attitude about the choices I make or will have to make?”
“Will the pursuit of my goals or needs lead to a moral choice?”
“Are the choices that I make based on an ethical standard or not?”
“What barriers do I face and how will I overcome them?”

"
"
Practice your stage entrances.,
Act outside of the box.,
Listen to the other characters’ lines.",How to Develop a Character for Theatre3," Before entering the stage, really think about where you have been before your entrance. This will help you channel genuine emotions and reactions once you get on stage. Then practice different stage entrances to see which one fits the scene best.For example, if you were supposed to be at the shopping mall before your entrance, think about how your shopping experience went. Did you find everything you were looking for? Are you tired from shopping? Did you run into an old friend or ex-boyfriend at the mall? Asking questions like these will help you set up an appropriate demeanor for your stage entrance.

, Take risks by trying different movements and positions on stage. See which ones fit your character and which ones don’t. Use rehearsal time to do this. Remember that you can always tweak your movements or exchange them for something different.For example, run around, jump on objects, fall down, cry or laugh until your stomach hurts. The main idea is to take risks to see what works and what does not.

, Instead of just reciting your lines, listen and pay attention to the lines of the characters that are speaking before and after you. This way, when it is time for your lines, you can speak and respond to the other characters in a more genuine and sincere way."

Be predictable and steady.,

Be convincing.,
Be at one with what will unfold.",How to Survive in Survivor," Learn as much as you can about the strategies others have used. Also, read online stories and articles about strategies used in the show and similar shows. Tuck these strategies away in your head, for future reference and mulling over.;
, You may not have the chance to feel this good for a while, so at least start out feeling your absolute best, both physically and mentally. Make sure that all issues back home are neatly tied up until you get back, assuming that you may be gone the whole time (after all, you're confident, right?).

, Just as you needed to be confident to get through the audition process and take the decision to be filmed and watched all over the world, you need to use that confidence to keep you going throughout the time you're on the show. There is also a little maxim about faking it till you feel it too... just don't lack humility in the process.

, Complainers really get on people's nerves, especially those with the resolve to not complain despite still feeling the pain. At the end of the day, even though those toughing it out or being laid back might not say anything, the last thing they want to put up with for very long is endless complaining. So, resort to grinning and bearing the small tribulations and keep your real complaints factual, attempting to include suggested solutions rather than simply dumping a problem onto the group. The less panicky, irritable and anxious you come across, the more comfortable others will feel around you.

, Whatever their strengths, backgrounds, talents and complaints, each of them has at least three things you can connect with, so look for those three things, even if you can't abide anything else about the person. Moreover, be the one person who will listen, never judge and always have their back. Remember that perception is almost everything––if the others like you, it gets harder to get rid of you. If you do get to the end, having the jury on your side is infinitely helpful..., While clearly everyone is on the show because they were competitive enough to get there, this doesn't necessarily translate to coping skills when under true pressure, not just auditioning pressures. Who among your fellow contestants appears from the get-go to have the most drive and determination likely to see them through starvation, injury, trash talk and difficult challenges? They're your real competitors but they're also potential collaborators, in terms of strengths and longevity.

, Some contestants may falsify weak or incompetent behavior initially, to put others off their guard. Moreover, one sign of weakness doesn't add up to a whole. It's best to be alert to weaknesses that appear when people are least able to control them, such as when hungry, tired or upset. Watch for tantrums, long bouts of crying, being down in the dumps, sulking, moping and other behavior that can signal the person is either not reliable or likely to do something that isn't constructive for either the team as a whole or you as an individual competitor.


Be friendly in general but steer clear of too close a connection with any person who regularly ""loses it"". Such people can tend to be jealous, afraid and ready to stab anyone in the back who might threaten or appear to undermine their weaker position. Referring back to step one, be nice.

, They may turn out to be the game changer, and referring back to step one, if everyone likes you and you haven't been belittling or mean, this may make all the difference. Jeff Probst notes that human beings have blind spots brought on by reduced awareness, which can cause stronger contestants to not see such outer contestants, until it's too late and for one reason or another, it has bad repercussions., This is your core team to strategize with and to even make a pact with about going to the end, together. Sure, one of you gets bumped but it's not bad having a millionaire for a friend forever more, is it?

, While it is possible to be Mr/Ms. Nice Guy/Gal throughout the series, realize that constant strategy must be behind your low-radar behavior, along with a willingness to seize the moment when it arrives. You will need to know when the moments are right, and that's not something an article can tell you because it all depends on context, timing and the people you're marooned with. Good luck there.

, You know they're there for the ratings and that they're bound to happen. Acting outraged and gobsmacked at such twists may not be the best approach; instead, take these in your stride, be reassuring to your team members that you can all manage it and get down to the task at hand with a sense of duty and confidence.

, It does seem that sticking under the radar and being inoffensive yet very helpful is a good way to begin the game. Leaders from the early stages risk being lopped, no matter how much you are tempted to take the reins.


If you have a feeling that everyone else around you is an idiot and that's the sole reason for taking charge, take a timeout from them all to check your feelings of superiority and overcome them before returning and being pleasant to the group again. You can steer pleasantly or yell and storm messily; the former is the better approach.

, Predictability can count for a lot when people start losing the plot and fearing there is no end to the hunger, uncomfortable sleep and difficult circumstances. The person who doesn't turn on others, who can always be relied upon to be there and say something cheery and who knows his or her stuff in terms of getting dinner on the table or a shelter up quickly will always be welcomed by everyone else. Slow and steady can often win the race.

, This isn't for everyone but it might work if you can gain a sympathy vote. For example, fans of the show will remember the lie Jonny Fairplay told about his dead grandmother, winning him the sympathy vote from his team members.Although this didn't win him the game, he did get a lot further than he probably would have without this strategy. It's not a fair and square clean approach though, so it's not recommended as it's liable to unravel at some point, and in a moment of weakness, you may let it slip...

, If you are going to take risks that expose you to the voting machinations of others, be sure to back these up with convincing talk or persuasive messaging that lets you off the hook from being a potential target. You'll know if you're good at that sort of communicating but you'll also need to be able to keep this up under pressure. Read books on persuasive techniques before going on the show.

, You don't know what will unfold, nobody does until it does unfold. Being mindful and at peace with the whole process, loving it for the journey that it is, as much as the destination, can help you to stay focused, calm and at ease with the whole game. That way, no matter what happens, you're a winner because you had an experience that most people in the world never will. Lucky you.

Use the TV industry's online marketplace, such as the TV Writers Vault, to submit your Reality Show Idea.",How to Sell a Reality Show Idea," You need to be able to describe your idea in 30 words or less. This will be called your logline. It should tell the premise and agenda of the show.;
, In other words, provide an outline of what will happen during the show. For example, in ""Dancing with the Stars,"" celebrities are paired with ballroom dance professionals who then compete in live dance exhibitions where they are then judged by a panel of judges and the television audience. Write the specific and main events of each episode, including any elimination, also showing how it evolves over the course of the season to a final episode.

, Avoiding this step can be like going to court without legal advice! Professional TV advisors are usually current or ex senior TV pros. They'll help you shape your idea so that it makes sense to the industry. The good ones will help you get funding and even walk it into the senior industry figures for you (google 'professional tv advisors' or similar)

, There are industry directories such as the Hollywood Creative Directory that list most producers and what kind of shows or movies they produce. Using a reference book like this, you can build a contact list.

, Almost all Production companies prohibit unsolicited pitches, so you'll have to call a lot of companies to find any development executives or producers who may take submissions. If they do, you will most likely be required to sign a release form. Be polite, but direct in your communications.

, There you will receive protected exposure, with electronic record of any Producer reviewing your material. Producers will then contact you directly for any deal proposal. You do not need an Agent when using these types of services, but always use an Attorney to negotiate and close any deal proposed when you're selling your project.

, Pull out your sketchbook and doodle on the pages. Sketch out a new character or improve in your art. You could also use art books as a reference to guide you in your drawing.

, Since long, idle hours are now in your hands, spend a few minutes in organizing your room. Pick up the trash from your floor or sort all the junk from your closet. However, avoid turning on the vacuum, or its noise may rouse everyone in the house.

, Not only is this an effective way to stay awake, but your productivity will increase. It also will benefit the wikiHow community!

, While the television may not be an option, you could use your computer and other hand-held devices, such as your cell phone. Turn up loud, energetic music to keep your interest perked, but using headphones or earbuds are recommended to avoid waking up the entire house.


Be careful about turning up the volume too high. Not only could that possibly damage your eardrums, but someone else might hear the music.

Hard, cold surfaces are the best to sit on. Try finding a metal chair to perch upon while performing your activities.
Don't lie on the floor. This will only cause you to fall asleep more easily.

, This will keep your mind and mouth engaged. Peppermints are an excellent option, as they stimulate the mind and perk you up. You could also nibble at small snacks, but avoid the crunchy ones - the noise could wake up your family. However, if you begin to doze off with the candy in your mouth, take it out - you could choke.

, While you may receive a large boost of energy, it won't sustain you throughout the entire night. You'll eventually find yourself suffering from a sugar crash, and this may result in falling asleep. Hot drinks, such as warm milk, are not recommended either. They will cause your body to relax, and you'll start to feel even more sleepy.

Make sure you look at the letter board and the category carefully first.,
Remember the most common letters in the English language: in order, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U.

,
Note that the commonly-guessed letter R is less common than often-slighted H and that L appears even further down on the list.

,
If the category is a plural, there's a 90% chance there's at least one S in the puzzle.,
In the categories, SONG/ARTIST and TITLE/AUTHOR, most contestants don't normally call the B & Y.,
In STAR & ROLE, the S is the no brainier followed by buying the A as the vowel, because you're sure to find the word AS in the puzzle.

,
In ON THE MAP, if the T is the third letter of a four-letter word, the C & Y could be the next choices before buying the I as your vowel, hoping CITY is in the puzzle.

,
In FOOD & DRINK, call a T first.,
If the T is the first letter of a three letter word, there's a 90% chance there will be the H before buying the E, hoping the puzzle has the definite article.

,
If you thought the T_ would be TO, it's not always the case.,
A TITLE or PHRASE that has a two letter word may have the word OF.,
For a PROPER NAME, take a look at the first blank word.,
The contractions can be interesting if you know what words fit as a contraction.,
If you call a N and it's the second last letter of a lengthy word, try calling a G before buying the I as your vowel.,
If there's a Q in the puzzle, buy the U as Q is normally followed by a U.

,
If you see any single spaces and you have the money, try buying the A first and if it's not where you thought, buy the I.,
If a THING begins with a two-letter word, it's most likely that the word is AN so call the N before buying the A, meaning the next word either starts with a vowel, or a silent H.

,
If you see a puzzle with a ?,
If you see any .,
If you know one of the key words in the puzzle, use context to deduce what some of the other key words could be.,
Try to call the multiple set of consonants when landing on a higher dollar amount.,
Buy vowels.,
When the category WHAT ARE YOU DOING?","How to Pick the Right Letters on ""Wheel of Fortune"""," It gets you an idea on what letters to go for first.;
,,, This is a 90% chance because not all plurals end with S. In addition, if there is no ""&"", see if you can call the N, D and buy the A.

, But those letters should be called first because those letters make perfect sense to be found in the puzzle as one word will contain the word BY.

,,, If the T is the third letter of a four-letter word, the H & W could be the next choices before buying the I as your vowel, hoping WITH is in the puzzle. Another hint in FOOD & DRINK, is there could be a C & H in a seven-letter word or a nine-letter word, hoping it's either CHICKEN or CHOCOLATE. If you see a nine-letter word in the puzzle, call a T first to make sure it's the second last letter in the word to know it could be CHOCOLATE. If a four-letter word starts with a C, the word could be CAKE, unless the word could be CANE as in a CANDY CANE, which could be considered for the holiday tapings.

,, If you buy a O and it's not where you thought the vowel would be, spin the wheel and call for a V.

, Call the N first to make sure.

, If there's five letters, try calling a T & R. If it's displayed _ _ T _ R, try spinning the wheel and call a C before buying the A & O as your vowels. If it's _ _ T R _ _ _, call a S & C. Make sure you call the multiple consonants on a higher dollar value before calling the A & E as your vowels.

, If there's a long word with one letter at the end after the ', call the S. For _ ' _ you should call either a M or D before buying the I as your vowel. For the ' followed by two spaces, it's best to call either the R or L. If neither filled in those two spots, try calling a V before buying the E as the vowel.

, It can be usually found in either an EVENT or FUN & GAMES.

,, Remember that if you don't know it, have the money, buy the vowels, they can always help, especially if there's a lot of money, prizes and a possible prize puzzle on the line. So if you don't know what consonant you should pick next, buy vowels if you have at least $250 to make sure you know which consonant you should pick next after spinning the wheel.

,, at the end, the best choice of letters to call are the W first and there would be a 90% chance the H will be in the puzzle as well as the first word could be WOULD. The other possible words: WHO; WHAT; WHEN; WHY; WHERE; HOW. Look at the spaces carefully to get the idea on what the word might be. If you see W H _ buy the O first to make sure. If the O is elsewhere, spin the wheel and call a Y.

, in the puzzle, such as _ _ . try to call the R first and then use your instinct on the other letter is a D or M for DR. or MR., otherwise if there letters are not where you thought, it could be ST. for ""saint"". If it's _ _ _ . call the M, R & S as they could be those letters in that part of the puzzle.

, For instance, if the puzzle is a two-word occupation, and you determine that the last word is ""engineer,"" think of different kinds of engineers that would fit with what's displayed so far for the first word.

, Five consonants at $300-$400 each would still make you happy, but wouldn't you be happier if you pick a consonant that only has one in the puzzle first? Make sure you save the multiple set of consonants for a higher dollar amount you land on, something with at least $600.

, They cost $250 & can be a huge help in trying to solve the puzzle. You don't have to risk spinning the wheel, although you do risk losing your turn. Do not waste money buying a vowel if you already know where it is. In particular, NEVER call a vowel if you land on Free Play! This is an utter waste of a very valuable turn. Landing on Free Play gives you the chance to call a less common consonant that might reveal one of the more obscure words. You can always buy a vowel, so don't waste your precious Free Play on a vowel. After you call a consonant, you can still buy the vowel whether or not the consonant was in the puzzle.

, comes up, 90% of the time it contains ""-ing"" and you should call the letters.

If you aren't pleased with your episode titles, come back to them after you've written out the script.;
, Be sure there is a clear beginning, middle, and end. The story's events should build up to the climax, where it all spirals down to the end. Jot down notes and thoughts, as well as dialogue between the characters if you can think of any. Arrange all your notes until you've come up with a clear story.


Making an outline of your story idea can be useful. It organizes your thoughts and the events into bullet points, and it will make more sense.

, The two most important props are the sonic screwdriver and the TARDIS.

, If you have problems, find a friend or hire someone who can come up with a professional-looking costume.

, Make sure you have permission to film in that area. Be sure it has good lighting and that no distractions are around. You can't work when there is background noise and people getting in the way.

, Be patient and remember that the actors may not always get the script right the first time. You may have to play around with new ideas and change the script.

, Be sure the volume is high enough so that the character's dialogue is clear. Create an intriguing introduction, and add special effects (most are downloadable). Unfortunately, a lot of the good ones require money.

Choose a TV show or broadcast that irritates you.,
Remember the history.,
Find the solution.,
Get on the web and research the mailing address, e-mail address or website of the advertiser.,
Write them a letter with the following message.,
Dear Sirs: Due to your participation as an advertiser on (this broadcast) I can no longer in good conscience patronize your company.,
Note that if you want to really irritate the matter, call the local office of the advertiser if possible.,
Apply this example to your personal situation.,
Use caution to not rely solely on e-mail.,
Remember one 'hilarious' historical note on using this approach to manipulate TV producers, broadcasters and advertisers includes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married%E2%80%A6_with_Children - the Terry Rakolta boycott where her media presence actually caused the ratings - and thus income - of ""Married with Children"" - to rise.,
Remember the summary: TV is a money driven media.,
Make TV what you want to be.",How to Manipulate Advertisers and Broadcasters," For this example, we will use the BTN - Big Ten Network.;
, The BTN has begun extorting money from fans and cable companies by only providing these games to cable company and satellite TV subscribers for games that in all past seasons aired FREE TO ALL on broadcast and cable by funded only by regular advertisers. Now, the average Joe cannot see his favorite Big Ten team play regular season games unless he has satellite TV or pays a premium for sports tier to his cable subscriber. Suffice it to say...you cannot point your TV antenna on your roof towards the local station and get IU or Purdue basketball games for free like in the past.

, Find a friend who gets the regular season games on his satellite or is paying the upgrade fee to his cable provider. Ask to watch the game with them or have them videotape the game. Or, go to a bar that is showing the games. Write down the names of the advertisers during the pre-game, game and post-game. Especially include the names of advertisers who use this type of promo: This post-game wrap-up sponsored by Fake Farm Insurance.

, If you can locate the name of the advertising agency of record for the advertiser so much the better.

, You can request a boilerplate letter by sending an e-mail to: tvshowfix@email.com.

, (This works no matter whether you are a current or prospective customer.) Please consider this as my notice of objection to your association with (organization / BTN). (Share details of your ire. Content, method of distribution, cost...whatever you are irritated by). I am making it part of my daily regime to discuss my discontent with (organization) with my family, friends, neighbors and co-workers and motivate them to also cease to patronize your company. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter. Complete the communication with your snail mail address or e-mail.

, For example: If Fake Farm Insurance is an advertiser on the basketball game that you previously viewed for free and now have to pay for (or go to a bar or friend's house to view)...call all of the local agent's offices and tell them how and why you are irritated. This will not go unnoticed at the corporate office. If hundreds or thousands of people do this every day after a basketball game...something will change. The advertisers will drop. The fees will drop. The house of cards will crumble. In this example - Big Ten basketball games will return to the free airways.

, There is power in numbers.

, E-mail is easily filtered and ignored. The exception is crashing the inbox. If the e-mail server is overwhelmed, advertisers cannot ignore that.

, She unwittingly created a windfall for a show she sought to have canceled.

, Only shows that make money are broadcast. Reducing the income of show increases the likelihood that is will be canceled or change the factors involved in its broadcast: content, manner and cost of distribution. You get the point. Broadcasters and advertisers hate controversy and what it costs them. When their mailboxes, e-mail boxes and switchboards are jammed with negative controversy that negatively affects their bottom line - things change and fast!

End the show by reminding viewers to tune in again.",How to Make a Game Show," There are many types of game shows on the market, and you need to decide which genre your show will belong to. Types of game shows include:


Trivia games like Jeopardy and Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?Puzzle games like Playmania and ConcentrationWord games like Wheel of Fortune and The Last WordPhysical competition games like American Gladiators and Battle DomePerformance competition shows like American Idol and America’s Got Talent;
, You need to find a way to set your show apart from all the other game shows on the market — you need to create an angle for yourself. The worst thing you can do is model yourself 100% off of an existing show, but you can mix and match aspects from different shows into a format unique to your own.


Do your contestants win prize money or object prizes (like a car or a free trip to the Bahamas)? Maybe they win a donation to a charity of their choice, like many “celebrity” episodes of established game shows.
You might narrow the scope of your game show to a specific theme: for example, a game show specifically about college football, aimed toward a sports-loving audience.
Do your contestants get the opportunity to try to dig themselves out of a hole by fighting back over a series of rounds, or does the contestant with the lowest score get eliminated at the end of each round?

, You don’t want your game show to be over too quickly, but you don’t want it to drag on forever, either. At minimum, your game should last at least half an hour to ensure that enough questions get asked and answered to make the audience feel like they’ve had a satisfying experience. If your show goes over an hour in length, they might start getting bored and stop paying attention.

, By providing a little bit of structure to the competition, you give the competitive nature of the show a narrative arc. At the end of each round, the audience can measure where the contestants stand in relation to one another; this raises the tension as to who will ultimately win.


Make sure each round is long enough to be fully developed — at least ten minutes each. The number of rounds will depend on the length of the show — a shorter show might have only two rounds, while a longer show might have four.
The rounds should be roughly the same length in time.
You can increase the point value for questions as rounds progress, making it more difficult for winners to maintain their lead and easier for the others to catch up; this increases the drama for the audience.
You can have a final round that is significantly shorter in length, but provides an opportunity to the contestants to dramatically shift the final score.
This might include a single question that is worth a large number or points, or perhaps allow contestants to wager how many points they’d like to risk on their final answer.

, Do you want your contestants to go into head-to-head individual competition, or do you want your show to pit teams of contestants against one another? If you’re going to have teams, do you want to randomly arrange teams from the pool of contestants, or have friends who already know each other apply together as a single team?

, All quiz games, from the weekly trivia game at your local bar to Jeopardy, divide their questions into themed categories.


Categories can be as broad or specific as you like, but have a good mixture of the two.
Examples of broad categories might include: science, history, music, or politics.
Examples of more specific categories might include: endangered species, World War II, punk music, or U.S. presidents.
Although you can repeat categories from time to time, vary them as much as possible between episodes. You don’t want contestants to be able to predict what types of questions you’re going to ask, and you don’t want your audience to get bored.

, A successful quiz show relies on the consistent production of high quality questions. It’s important that you have a large bank of questions to draw from, and that you do all the research necessary for the show ahead of time, so you don’t get caught unprepared.


Develop more questions than you need. You can always save some questions for the future. This strategy also gives you to option to choose the best, most interesting questions from a larger pool rather than making do with the first handful of questions that came to mind.
Work ahead of time. Don’t put off research for the last second, as you may run into a time crunch
Organize a team of researchers. Draw on the strengths of each individual researcher and delegate specific categories to them. For example, researchers with scientific backgrounds should develop science-themed questions, which researchers with English backgrounds should develop literature-themed questions.
Follow a research schedule. Don’t allow yourself to get off track during the week if you plan a weekly show. After delegating responsibility to your research team (or simply concretizing the categories for yourself), set deadlines for when questions will be due.
For example, if you have a team, you might set a mid-week deadline for a pool of questions three times the size of what you need for the episode. Two days before the episode, you must winnow that pool down to the questions you will actually use that week.

, Although you can find websites where trivia-type questions are provided fairly easily, you should only use them as a last resort, because everyone has access to that same bank of generic questions.Audiences and contestants will be far more engaged with interesting, challenging questions that can’t be found in a generic trivia bank, but which you or your team found through thoughtful research.

, When developing your questions, keep your audience in mind. Steer clear of topics that might bore them; for example, an entire category devoted to the periodic table of elements might get tiresome.


Consider who you’re writing this show for. Depending on your demographic, you’ll need to develop different strategies to attract viewer interest.
If the show is geared toward teenagers, you can develop questions about pop music, movies, or young adult novels.
If the show meant for people who wish to watch academically rigorous competition, focus on the types of subjects taught in university classes: philosophy, political science, etc.
Questions about topical events and stories currently in the news can also make your viewers perk up.

, If the questions are consistently too difficult for your contestants to answer, you might see a decrease in potential contestants. Furthermore, the audience will likely grow bored with the show if contestants are consistently unable to field the questions.


While it’s good to have challenging questions from time to time — ones that are designed to stump everyone — the majority of your questions should skirt the fine line between challenging and obscure.
You can rank the questions within each category by difficulty, beginning with easier questions and building up to more difficult ones.

, Although the talent of your contestants is the real selling point in this genre of game show, you also want to vary the challenges enough to both keep them on their heels and keep your audience engaged. Before you even begin filming your pilot episode, plan out the challenges you want your contestants to complete for the entire season of your show.

, Many performance competition game shows focus on skills that have a revered tradition with well-loved classics. If your game show falls into this category, the people who watch your show might respond well to watching modern-day contestants pay homage to the tradition of their art.


For a cooking game show, have contestants recreate classical dishes with a long tradition, such as chicken cordon bleu or a croquembouche.For a singing game show, have contestants sing old standards that demonstrate their ability to step into a song imbued with someone else’s legacy — Aretha Franklin’s “Chain of Fools” or Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” for example.

, While it takes a great deal of skill to execute a classical standard, asking your contestants to bring their own personality and point of view to a well-loved classic presents an interesting challenge.


For a dancing game show, you might ask competitors to create new choreography for a song that has a beloved performance already associated with it — Gene Kelly’s performance of “Singing in the Rain,” for example., While you want to design many of your challenges to highlight your contestants’ creativity and innovation, showcasing their technical skills can also enthrall viewers.


For a dancing game show, see how many pirouette turns dancers can do without losing their balance, for example.

, Sometimes, it’s hard to challenge a skilled batch of contestants. A good way to put pressure on them when challenging their technical abilities is to place a time restriction on their task.


For a cooking game show, for example, you might see which contestant can Brunoise dice a pile of vegetables most quickly with an even cut., Though some of the challenges can be about technical proficiency, design other challenges to set contestants up in a way that allows them to showcase their personalities.


On a cooking game show, you might ask contestants to cook a dish that speaks to them from their childhood.
On a singing game show, you might challenge the contestants to compose their own songs rather than simply perform those of others.

, In some fields, such as singing and dancing, it may be more difficult to demonstrate innovation because the performers are not necessarily the ones composing or choreographing the pieces. However, if your show showcases a field where your contestants can push the envelope in their industry, design challenges that lead them toward innovation.


For a fashion design game show, ask contestants to create an evening look geared toward women ten years from now.
For a cooking show, ask contestants to deconstruct a simple dish or simplify a complex dish.

, Although you want your contestants to be able to demonstrate their own personalities and styles, you also want to see how they can adapt to a wide variety of constraints.


For a dancing game show, have them work in styles from ballet to hip hop to classical Indian folk dance.
Have cooking game show contestants cook vegan dishes one week, then break down and butcher sides of beef for their own steak dishes the next.

, There are a number of different ways you can test contestants’ strength in that are more entertaining than simply having them lift weights in a gym. Some examples might include:


Putting them through a classic childhood exercise like a wheelbarrow race; not only do the contestants have to prove their arm strength over a long distance, but the audience can enjoy laughing along with grown contestants engaging in childish games.Recreate a fun state fair environment by having contestants throw balls at targets for prizes; however, the balls should be heavy medicine balls, and the targets should be far away.
Use your imagination — there are any number of ways to have fun while challenging muscle strength.

, You can have them compete head on in simple racing heats, or you can make it a little more interesting by asking them to complete unrelated tasks during their race. For example, contestants sprint for 50 yards, solve a riddle that’s taped to a card at the 50 yard point, sprint back to the starting point, solve a math problem, sprint up a deck of stadium stairs, recite the alphabet backwards, then sprint back to the starting point. Again, you can jazz up the contest however you want, but you want to showcase your contestants’ speed.

, This skill set might have the most potential for entertainment value in a game show setting. You might have contestants engage in an old fashioned pie toss, a dunk tank, or an overgrown, amped up game of dodgeball. A bonus round challenge might be to award extra points to whichever contestant can hit a full-court basketball shot first.

, Obstacle courses raise the stakes by forcing contestants out of their comfort zone. You might set up a military-style outdoor obstacle course, with climbing walls, balance beams, lift-and-carry exercises, and dead sprints.You might aim instead for a funnier tone, booby-trapping contestants with water balloons or flour bombs at points throughout the obstacle course.


The benefit of an obstacle course is that it tests many elements of your contestants’ fitness at the same time, rather than isolating strength from speed from coordination.
Make sure your contestants are safe at all times. Use rubber pads on any hard walls or objects contestants might run into, and don’t aim projectiles at them that could inflict injury if it made contact.

, Whether you’re trying to sell your game show to a major network or local broadcast television, or even just filming it to upload on Youtube, you will need help from a team of people to make your game show a reality. You will need, at minimum:


Camera operators — you need enough camera angles to show the host and all of the contestants. If you have individual contestants, you might just need two camera operators — one for the host and one for all of the contestants. However, if you have multiple teams, you might need a camera operator dedicated to each team.
A production editor — someone who is familiar with video production software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut.
A sound technician — someone who can ensure that the sound quality of all the dialogue on the show is picked up clearly.
A charismatic host — the host you choose will set the tone for your show. Whether you pay someone, ask a friend to help you out, or go for it yourself, you need to make sure that the host brings a high level of energy to the proceedings

, The host should introduce each contestant by name, asking them to share a little about themselves. This biographical information can be cut and dry (“My name is Amy, and I’m an accountant for the city of Austin”) or more whimsical (“My name is Amy, and I have a cat who likes to go hiking with me on a leash every weekend”).

, Even if your show has been running for a while, you may have new viewers on a given week who are unfamiliar with it. It’s a good practice to introduce the show by briefly explaining the rules and format of the game at the top of each to make sure everyone knows what’s going on.


Create a set script for the introductory rule explanation. This will both ensure that the rules are clearly stated every episode and create a comfortable, familiar segue into the episode for returning viewers.

, If this is a televised show, there will be consistent breaks for commercials — but even if your show is online, it’s a good idea to allow resting spots every once in a while, ideally between rounds.


When a round ends, the host should recap the scores at that point in the game.
This is a good time for the host to comment on how the game is going so far, or to ask the contestants how they’re feeling about their performance.
These little breaks will give both the audience and the contestants time to reset for the next round of competition.

, If your show has a format that changes from round to round, make sure your host explains the new rules at the beginning of each round. You might have a stable format for each different round, like Jeopardy or Chopped, or you might have completely different challenges in each round from week to week, like Project Runway or Top Chef.

, The audience wants to like the people they’re watching, especially the host who remains a constant from episode to episode. Make sure the host is personable throughout, joking with contestants, complimenting them when they do something well, and allowing them to display their personalities.

, As each episode draws to a close, the host should thank the contestants for participating and congratulate the winner on their victory. Take a brief moment before the show ends to thank the audience for watching the show, and invite them to join you again for your next episode. Tell them the date, time, and channel on which the show appears so they know exactly when and where they can find the next episode.

Pay a one time fee to rent a program.,
Pay a one time fee to own a copy of a TV show or movie.,
Subscribe to a streaming service.",How to Legally Watch TV and Movies Online1," In a modern-day version of the video store, online rental services allow viewers to watch a program once in a specific amount of time. Obviously, services, titles, and costs vary but renting a TV show or movie is a good option if you only want to watch a title once, as it is cheaper than purchasing the program outright. A few examples of popular online sites that provide program rentals are:



iTunes. Apple's iTunes store has a ton of television and movie content available for download, and downloading the necessary software is free and easy. Prices vary but renting an individual TV show will cost about $1.99, or an entire season will cost around $30. TV shows are usually available on iTunes within a couple days of having been broadcast but not all TV series are available.

Amazon also provides a rental program for TV shows and movies. Rental costs are pretty comparable to those of iTunes, but if you have Amazon Prime, Amazon's paid membership, many titles are free to stream. Unlike iTunes, most titles are available for streaming instead of downloading, although programs can be downloaded onto Amazon mobile devices.;
, Buying a movie or TV show for download or streaming will cost you as much as buying a DVD but it gives you the convenience of watching it on any number of devices. You'll be able to watch them whenever you like, for as long as you like, and they won't expire the way that online rentals do. Remember that even though you have bought the title, it doesn't guarantee you will be able to make hard copies of it or send a digital copy to a friend. Some sites that sell digital copies of movies and TV shows include:



iTunes gives you the option to buy or rent all of their TV and movie titles, although one option may be available before the other. iTunes purchases are downloaded straight to your computer and can be accessed through the iTunes program. When buying a TV show or movie, you will have the ability to watch it as many times as you like.

Amazon also allows you to buy copies of TV shows and movies. Unlike iTunes, however, Amazon gives you the choice of downloading the content, so that you can play it when not connected to the internet, or keeping your access through streaming from their site. The second option is great if your computer's memory is getting full and you don't have enough storage room for a big file, like those of movies, but requires specific software from Amazon or an Amazon mobile device.

, Pay a monthly fee to access TV and movies online. These services allow viewers to watch a wide variety of programs without the hassle of paying for each program individually. Whether you are concerned about watching the latest episode of your favorite show or you want to watch all of the episodes of an old obscure sitcom, there are different services for you.



Netflix started out as a DVD rental service that operated through the mail but they have switched their focus in recent years to their instant streaming service. Netflix now allows you to watch TV shows and movies on your computer, or on your television through an approved device, without having to wait for the mail to arrive. There's a monthly fee but with Netflix you are able to watch as many streaming movies and TV shows as you want. If you love to watch TV shows and movies, but aren't particular about seeing the very latest releases, then this paid subscription might be for you.

Huluplus is a subscription that greatly expands the amount of videos you can watch on the free content website Hulu. It has all of the free content available on the basic Hulu site, but includes many more TV episodes and movies. Huluplus also gives access to many TV shows the day after they originally air, while Hulu takes approximately a week to make shows available. For up to the date episodes, paying for Huluplus may be worth the cost.

Watch your favorite show on the website of its television network.,
Watch shows on a website with a wide variety of ad supported programming.,
Use your paid cable subscription to access online content.",How to Legally Watch TV and Movies Online2," All of the major networks make many of their shows available to watch online for free via their own websites. You may have to wait a day or two for a prime-time show to become available on the site, and you'll have to sit through a few commercials, but the pros far outweigh the cons. You can watch when you want to, or when it fits your schedule, and there are actually fewer commercials online than on TV.


Don't wait too long to watch the latest episodes because shows are usually only available for a limited amount of time after they've aired.

, While the number of movies you can watch on these type of sites is very limited, this is a great way to be able to watch current TV shows for free. Not all shows, or current episodes, will be available to stream for free, so if you're desperate to watch something specific this may not be the best way to go about it. But remember, it's free!


For example, Hulu pulls in shows and movies from several online sources, mostly the major networks and a few cable networks, too. Hulu only makes five episodes of any TV show available at any given time, so if you miss one, you're out of luck. The site is free to use, but they also recently launched their Hulu Plus service where you can watch any episode of any TV show season they have available without worrying about expiration, and get access to other premium content as well. Either way, you still have to sit through some commercials.

, Many of the cable TV stations now offer online streaming as part of your cable TV package. This includes basic cable channels, such as FX or USA, as well as premium channels like HBO or Showtime. To access the content, you will need to know your account login and password, available from your cable company. While its true that the cost for access is included in your cable bill, the downside is that many of these channels make you watch ads as well, basically costing you both time and money. In general, these sites are currently only available to paid cable subscribers, however there is some talk that individual subscriptions to the websites may be available in the future.

Understand that when you dance lyrical, your movements show the words of the song.,
Try to come up with lots of different feelings and moves.,
Find a stage, an open place, such as a basement, or even outside in your front lawn (if you do do this, make sure there is an outlet so you can plug in a CD player).,
Pick a song with deep meaning and flowing music, otherwise it gets a little harder to stay fluent with your movements.

,
Listen to the song.,
Do your body a favor; before you dance, make sure you stretch.,
Just let your body flow.,
Learn tricks.",How to Dance to Lyrical Music," This means that if the words were , ""She falls like the petal drifting from it's rose,"" you would gracefully sink to the floor and pretend to be the petal. Fluent is where you pour your heart and feelings out with your movements. Let's just say if you danced fluent to the rose petal line, you would probably feel sad because ""she is drifting"", so you would show that with a sad, but graceful, drift away from the center.;
, It would get very boring to watch someone do the same movement over, and over, and over again.

, The best places are the ones with a large lengthy mirror on the wall.

,, You should listen to it maybe 2-3 time to get the feel of the words, instruments, and the tempo.

, This is a key part in getting better. You don't want to pull a muscle and not be able to practice, so be sure to stretch your arms, legs, neck, and maybe do some push-ups. If you plan on doing tricks, be sure to stretch extra well, so you won't get injured.

, This sometimes is a hard concept for some people to understand. When you dance fluently, like the water in a stream, you let your body pretend you are trapped under the ocean. (Pretend you can still breathe) You would get bored just standing there with nothing to do, so you start to flow. Your limbs are floating, your heart lies on a cloud, your eyes are closed. You outstretch your fingers and open your mind to more fluent movement. You touch the sky with every reach and skim the ocean's sandy floor while the suns rays dance around you. This is how it feels to dance fluent. You move your arms and legs and head so they flow gracefully together.

, To make your dance stand out, you may want to add tricks. There are hundreds of dance tutorials online. Chose a tutorial from an actual known dancer(so you can guarantee it's safe) and follow the teacher. Some examples of tricks are pirouettes, splits, barrel rolls, jumps, and leaps.

, While facing one another and standing straight, the man then places his right hand under the shoulder blade of his partner and intertwines her free hand with his own. The left arm must be at the height of the shoulders. The woman’s left hand must be placed at the top of her partner’s shoulder blade.

, One of the more important steps to Kompa dancing is hip movement. Slightly bend your right knee and pick up your right foot as you move your hips toward that direction. When swaying to the right and hitting that step, simultaneously slightly bend the left knee and pick up the left foot while shifting your hips toward that direction. Doing this will help you build a rhythm.

, While doing the same hip movement, move closer to your partner with the man now placing his right hand on his partner’s side, under her armpit and close to her breast. The woman places her entire left arm around her partner and places her left hand on her partner’s left shoulder blade. Doing this will create a stronger sense of guidance and direction for you and your partner.

, Now that you and your partner have the hang of the first few steps, now it is time to get out of a stationary position. While doing the previous steps, move in a rhythmic pace frontward and backward. Be sure to move your leg simultaneously with your partner’s opposite leg. (If they move their left leg, move your right).

, This step all depends on the chemistry your partner and you have with each other. While doing all the previously mentioned steps, add moving in a circular motion with your partner to it."

, Your arms will give you momentum to complete the turn. As you initiate your turn you want to close your arms into a circle as if you are holding a round beach ball. They should be straight out in front of your chest with your hands facing with palms inward and thumbs aligned., As you lift your back leg place your foot above the knee of your straight leg with your toe pointed toward the ground and turn. The one legged stance is known as relevé. Remember to keep your back straight and arms in a circle in front of you as you turn., Spotting is when you pick an item just above your eyeline that you focus on as you turn your head. This keeps your head straight and level as you turn. The quicker you spot, the quicker your turn will be. Hold your gaze as long as possible to help keep your balance., Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals for a single pirouette, move on to multiple pirouettes by keeping your momentum and focusing on your form. You cannot achieve multiple pirouettes without first learning the basics of a single one., Your core should be completely engaged to complete each pirouette. Focus on having proper balance and correct alignment. Picture being pulled up from the top of your head by an invisible string to a high relevé.


Strengthen your core with exercises like yoga, pilates, ballet, and jazz dance.

, Spotting is exactly as it sounds as you turn your head and spot a point to turn your head in the direction you want to pirouette in. In order to achieve neat, quick turns your head must follow suit with a sharp, quick head turn. Spot a point slightly above your eye line, which will lift your chin as you turn.


If you look at the floor you will fall. Your pirouette will follow your line of sight as it helps you keep your balance.

, Your hips should be aligned with your shoulders as you complete each pirouette. Your balance will be off as you turn if your alignment is off. Use a mirror as you stand in relevé to ensure that your shoulders and hips are aligned.


Check your side stance as well when you are at the mirror to ensure that you’re not leaning too far forward or back.

, The base of each pirouette will be balanced on relevé so focus on keeping this balance without turning. You should be able to balance on relevé for several seconds otherwise you won’t be able to stay up during your pirouettes. Build your strength by balancing on each leg for 8 seconds or more. Try to balance as long as you can each time you practice.


Practice different turns to improve your balance such as turned-out retire, non-turned-out jazz pirouette, and turns in a la seconde. Changing up your turns will improve your balance.
Compete with your friends to make practicing more fun. See who can hold their balance the longest.

, Retire is a pose in ballet where your raise one leg to the side and bend the knee of that leg so that your toe points to make the sole of your foot parallel to the knee of your other leg. Your toe on your raised leg should be glued to the knee of your straight leg. If your toe drops below your knee as you pirouette, your turn will also drop. Your toe will pull your weight down so keep it level to your knee with your toe pointed. Not pointing your toe looks sloppy and ruins your form.

, Give each pirouette energy by pushing off the floor from a deep plié position. Imagine that you are a spring so that you are ready to bounce up when pushed down. Give each pirouette momentum as you push yourself up from the ground. Control your force as you don’t want to push with too much energy that it throws off your coordination.


You want a deep plié for a powerful turn. Try breathing out as you plié to increase your power.

, Make sure to wear proper footwear as it is difficult to execute multiple pirouettes barefoot because your feet will stick to the floor. You may also get a painful burn. There are special dance shoes designed specifically for pirouettes that you can purchase online or at your local dance store. These shoes enhance your natural arch will provide the traction needed to turn efficiently.

, Keep the energy close to your body by crossing your palms over each other and keeping your arms close in a tight and neat circle. Make sure that your arms are connected to your back and shoulder blades by pretending that there is a rod that keeps your shoulder blades and upper back wide and open.


If your arms open from a tight and neat circle the energy and weight will be dispersed and through off your coordination.

, Do not turn your supporting foot before you initiate the turn by allowing your other foot to take off.Your hip and shoulder will open too early and your arms will lag behind. Push off your back toes to initiate the turn and keep your leg turned in. Keep your core in one piece as you use your arms as a steering while to guide your core around the turn.You know your coordination is off if you feel out of control or like you are in the spin cycle of your washing machine.

, Spot before you turn and do not change it. Changing your spot as you turn will throw you off. If you spot too slowly or too fast your rotation will suffer. Think of the music when you need to spot; then, spot, hold, and follow through., Poor alignment can come from sitting on your supporting side, lifting your working hip, or throwing your upper body back. Think about squaring your hips and shoulders, keeping your core engaged, and keeping your legs strong under you. Push down on your supporting leg as you lift the other to follow through in your turn under balance., Practice fundamentals and technique. Don’t develop bad habits. Focus on every movement and the correct function of each part of your body. Use a mirror to help with form. Practice with friends to help support each other.


Avoid changing your focal mid spot or spotting too slowly. This will throw off your coordination and balance. Make sure you keep your core engaged and keep your body in a straight line. It’s easy to fall into the bad habit of tilting or slouching if you don’t focus on keeping your body pulled up.

Start the Pirouette.,
Spot during your spin.,
Slow your speed gently and gracefully land in the starting position.,
Practice.",How to Do a Jazz Pirouette," Split sole (vs. full sole) allows more flexibility for your foot. It is easier to bend, whether pointing your toes or flexing for a spin. Half soles / Turning shoes also work good for pirouettes.;
, Warming up for dance is extremely important. It loosens your body and muscles which can lessen the chance of muscle pulling and strain.

, Place your legs in fourth position, with your feet parallel. Raise your opposite arm to the foot that is in front and take your other arm and raise it to your side. Your arms should look like an 'L'.


Front heel should be down while the back heel is popped up ready to be used for lift.

, Demi plie in your fourth position and snap your foot to posse. Push off your back foot and place leg into a parallel posse. Spin on your front toes and point your foot.


While you are placing your leg into a parallel fourth position , put your arms into the jack knife position. This is also where you get momentum for the turns and will help you with doubles, triples, and so on.

, You can spot by looking at one thing in the middle of your pirouettes (usually yourself in the mirror, or pick out a person in the crowd on stage). During the spin, quickly whip your head around and find your point to look at in the middle of each turn.

, Do not throw your beautiful turn away! Hold your arms, posse, and balance for a split second to the front before you land completely.

, These turns will not be perfect overnight. Practice at your studio, at home, in the grocery store, anywhere you can! Pirouettes take time to perfect.

Dance perreo.,
Prepare for rivalry.,
Dress the part.",How to Dance Reggaeton2," A classic Reggaeton dance move is often referred to as ""perreo,"" which means ""doggie"" and refers to the move's explicit sexual overtones. The man stands behind the woman and both grind their hips and shoulders in time to the music, imitating a dog's sex act.


When you dance perreo, it's important to keep in constant body and skin contact with your dance partner. Rubbing and rubbing up against each other conveys strength, warmth, energy and desire.

, When it comes to men, much of reggaeton is about posturing and machismo. For women, it's about desire and turning on and being turned on by your dance partner.


If you're a man, seek out a rival and join him in dancing with a woman. One of you should dance in front of her, the other behind. Do your best to out dance your rival and use your sexuality to woo the woman.
If you're a woman, take turns dancing with both of your dance-floor suitors. When the dance is over, choose the one who did the best job of making you sweat.

, It doesn't matter what your body type is when you dance reggaeton; that really counts is a fashionable outfit.


If you're a woman, it's all about showing off your best assets. Tight pants and tops that display rather than conceal the body are the norm. Dress in a way that makes you feel sexy and is likely to attract a guy's attention. Don't worry if you have a little extra weight around your hips; ""love handles"" are considered desirable.
If you're a guy, go for well-known brands. You can even pull off an imitation of knock-off brand if it has a big, flashy logo. Also popular are loose, baggy shirts with the names of North American football and basketball teams. A pair of huge sneakers, caps, sunglasses and backpacks are all accessories that add a flair of authenticity to your look.

, Instead of focusing on the stars of the film, pay attention to the background dancers when they cut loose after hours dancing in the bungalows where they bunk.

, Choose clothing you can take off with ease. Clothes with elasticity, snaps, and ties are easiest to slip off, while buttons and zippers are more cumbersome. Refrain from applying lotions, glitter, etc.. that can come off on stage or on the poles. Wear non-slip heels.

, They give a show before your remove them. Think of visual teasing with the clothing you pick -- coordinated works best -- not mismatched duds.

, Decide what body part(s) are your greatest asset and focus on using it -- trust your friends to help you decide -- a great butt or set of boobs need to be ""worked"" so the crowd appreciates the look.


Practice in a private area, such as a bathroom or a bedroom, at least a few times. Get your planned routine down. One method may be to remove your skirt, followed by your shirt, then the bra and the panties or thong. Or you may remove your shirt and bra and then later your skirt and underwear. Your routine should be one you are comfortable with and will likely help you win.

, Get there at least a couple of hours early in order to get comfortable and sign up. There will be a form and/or a legal release to sign.

Pick a person to focus on during your dance -- it is super sexy.
Don't look bored -- always keep a bright natural smile and enjoy yourself.
Time your strip so you are just about naked about 45 seconds before the end then remove it and pose several ways as the end comes. Avoid getting all clothes off too early -- the thrill is in the tease.

Have fun with it!",How to Dance Freestyle," Get in front of a full length mirror. It's important that you see your whole body. Then, put on your most comfortable clothes (don't worry about what people would think if they saw you in them) and turn the music on. Pick a song that:


you like
you can dance to easily
is at least somewhat popular;
, Just move your body to the music, however it feels right. Don't worry if it looks absolutely ridiculous, which it very well might. Do what you want to the move your entire body to compliment the music. Your moves don't have to be coordinated, match, or make sense, just dance. Jump around to that cool song in your PJ's for hours if you have to. Just get comfortable with dancing.

, Try to have a pretty good idea of the beat and lyrics of the song so you know when it gets slower, faster or when to come in or fade out, or do something crazy. Listen to the song a few times and get familiar with it. Dance some more.

, You can have three or four or maybe just one move that's totally yours. They should go with the music and feel natural when you're dancing to them. For beginners, consider making your first few moves include snaps and/or claps. This can help you stay steady and on beat- it's an established fact. You can throw in these moves once in a while when they fit in and when you're stuck.

, Like one minute you've got your hands doing some cool thing above your head, then you swing them around and you're moving your hips. Use different levels of dancing and make it interesting.

, Watch dance shows or professional dancers. Do not copy their dance moves, but they should give you ideas on how to come up with your own and move to the music.

, Wherever you are and you're expected to dance, go back to Step 2 and remember: make it feel natural and with the music. Connect with the music. Connect with the crowd. Have confidence and just move your body.

, Try a class that covers a variety of dances to see what you like. In addition, the instructor can provide you with instruction on proper safety techniques.

, Evidence shows that you can learn a great deal by watching other people. In fact, psychologically speaking, observing other people dancing lets your brain add to the mental maps that you're already making regarding dance move. Plus, you can see how certain moves are supposed to look when done properly.Take in a professional show to see professionals at work, or even visit a local college that offers dance. Often, the schools will have showcases that are open to the public.

, You'll be able to observe other dancers and even copy moves. Plus, if you try a variety of dance clubs, it will help you decide on the type of dance you'll love. Try everything from hip-hop clubs to ones that feature country music and two-stepping. Don't be afraid to jump in, and give the moves a try.

, You don't have to stick with it forever. Just chose something you enjoy. You can try ballet, contemporary, jazz, ballroom, or even country dancing to begin your dance lessons.

, Do you want to dance professionally, or do you just want cool dance moves for Saturday night? Are you trying to learn to ballroom dance for your wedding? Decide on what skill level you want to achieve because that will determine your level of commitment. For instance, dancing professionally takes years of committed practice and classes, but you can probably learn to dance for your wedding in a month or two., Dance videos will help you learn certain moves, as well as help with your technique. Go for instructional videos rather than just trying to copy moves you like. Instructional videos will show you how to do it, rather than you guessing at how it's done.

, You will need some space, as well as a smooth, solid floor. Remember, you will be making some noise, so you need a place where you won't bother people.

, The music should be appropriate to the genre, although most genres incorporate a wide range of music. Typically, though, you'd use something classical for ballet, while you can use a wide range of today's music for contemporary.

, Practicing helps solidify the skills in your brain, and your body will remember the moves you learn., Kids seem to learn skills faster because they aren't as afraid of looking dumb. If you mess up or have trouble getting a move, don't take it as a sign that you should stop dancing. It just means that you need more practice. Get up and try again., Don't try too much too soon, as you can injure yourself.

, When dancing, use clothes loose enough to move, but tight enough that you don't trip over yourself. Take off any jewelry so it doesn't go flying. Dance shoes are best for dancing, as they have smoother soles for turns. Also, tie up your hair so it doesn't get in the way., Not only will it help you practice, it will also help you see how a choreographer thinks, which is beneficial if you get into professional dancing with choreographers., Sites like Giveit100 let you document your progress with any new skill through progress, giving you encouragement from a community. It also lets you see how you've progressed from your first day of dancing., Videos can help you here, as can practicing in front of a mirror to see how your dancing looks. If you're just practicing the move without seeing how it looks, you may not be doing it correctly., Dancers need to eat healthy foods to fuel their bodies.If you're dancing a great deal, you need to enough calories to fuel that dancing. However, if you're only dancing a little bit, you may need to cut back on calories to get the body you want for dancing.


Be sure to include plenty of protein in your diet. In addition, feed your body fruits and vegetables so it has enough vitamins to be strong.

, To dance well, you need to build up your muscles and stamina.


Activities like swimming, skiing, using an elliptical, and biking provide great overall workouts that will help you achieve a stronger body., Dancers need to be as flexible as possible to perform the moves they do. Try activities like yoga and pilates to increase your flexibility. As an added bonus, these activities will increase your core strength, making you a better dancer., Balance is also important to dancing, as you need good balance when doing fast-paced moves to remain upright. Yoga and pilates can help with balance, as can programs like tai chi. Tai chi also helps reduce stress and increase flexibility., If you want to become a professional dancer, you will need proper training. You will need to take a variety of classes, beginning with beginner classes and moving up as your skill level increases. However, classes can be fun and helpful even if your goal is to two-step at a local dance club. For cheap classes, check with local dance studios, your city's parks and recreation programs, and even your local community college.

, You can also major in dance at a university. However, these programs are very competitive, and most of them will be difficult to get into. Also, be aware that many dance programs require you to be a certain weight to be a part of the program.

, If you've taken a few classes and want to just have fun as a dancer, try auditioning for community theater. In most community theater programs, you'll run into amateurs like yourself, so you'll be in good company.

, Work with your future spouse to choreograph your dance for your wedding. It's one way to make that first dance truly special.

, Maybe you want to just impress your friends at the dance club. If that's true, try out your moves on a Saturday night.

Begin by doing warm-up exercises.,
Practitioner should be aware of Dhol(Indian drums) beats because dhol and bhangra are like husband and wife who love each other and wouldn't divorce.

,
Stand with your feet fairly close together and your hands on your hips.,
Place your left foot on the ground and face toward the center of the room.,
Continue to do the steps while turning slowly in a circle to the left.,
Add to the circle by raising your arms with your elbows bent and your hands up.,

Turn about in circle to the left while continuing to tap your heels on the ground (Step 7).,
Begin to move forward as you continue tapping each heel on the floor.,
Stand with your feet fairly close together and your hands on your hips.",How to Dance Bhangra," Because the Bhangra is fast-paced, exercises like jumping jacks and jogging in place helps build up your stamina. Another more-difficult exercise is jumping squats, where you leap up and down while keeping your knees bent and your body low.;
,, Hop on your right foot and lift your left leg with your knee angled to the left. Angle your body to the left as well.

, Hop on your left foot as you lift your right foot from the ground and angle your body to the right. Work on lifting your knees higher and higher while still staying with the beat of the music.

, When you face front again, lift your left foot and your right foot before turning in a circle again.

, Step forward with your right foot and hop while lifting your left foot and turning your body to the left. Raise and lower your arms as you rotate your hands (similar to Queen Elizabeth's wave). Do the same with your right foot. Continue the steps all the way around the circle.

, Exaggerate the movements of your hands to make the rotations crisper.

, Pick up your left foot and tap your heel on the ground at an angle from your body. Return your left foot to the original position and tap your right heel on the ground. Remember to turn your body in the direction of the heel that's tapping on the ground.

, Work on making the movements more fluid and allow your head to move from side to side in time with the music.

, Add arms movements to the steps. As you step forward and tap your left heel on the ground, place your back of your left hand against the small of your back and raise your right hand over your head and wave it. As you step forward, tapping your right heel on the ground, reverse the position of your hands.

, Step forward and to the side with your left foot. Rock back on your right then again on your left. Turn in a circle to your left as you continue rocking back and forth on your feet with your left foot before you. Move in a circle with your left foot leading and angled to the side. Raise your hands before you and clap with each beat.

Wear a waistcoat.,
Choose an oversized shirt.,
Wear black pants.,
Add a vest.,
Choose tall boots.,
Wear a hat.,
Add an eye patch.,
Get a hook or a peg leg.,
Use a low, gravelly voice.,
Mutter or slur your words.,
Learn the lingo.,
Drop your gs and vs. Pirates aren’t worried about pronouncing their words correctly.,
Use “be” instead of “am/are.” Pirates be bad with grammar!,
Avoid saying “you” and “you’re.” Pirates say “ye” rather than “you,” and “yar” rather than “you are” or “you’re.” Switching out these simple words will have you sounding like a pirate in no time.,
Use “me” instead of first-person possessives.,
Double up on your adjectives.,
Growl and scowl.,
Gesture a lot.,
Get a parrot.,
Carry weapons.,
Wear hoop earrings.,
Get a telescope.,
Walk like a pirate.,
Assemble a pirate crew!,
Drink rum.",How to Act Like a Pirate," Adding a waistcoat to your look says you’re the captain of the pirates! Choose one with brass buttons or detailing. You can often find these in vintage stores or costume shops. If not, look online.;
, Your shirt should be baggy, so pick one a few sizes larger than you normally would. Choose white or beige, in any fabric. You can choose a blouse or a shirt with ruffles, or a common dress shirt. Tuck it into your pants, let the collar lie flat, and leave the cuffs unbuttoned.You can also add a sash or scarf in a bright or contrasting color to your waist.

, Long, loose trousers are ideal, but any pair of black pants will do, as long as they aren’t denim. You will want to tuck the pants into your boots to achieve true pirate style.You can also cut off the bottoms of your pants for a ragged look.
Women can opt for pants or for a long, flowing, poofy skirt., Choose a red, navy, or black vest to wear over your shirt. A fabric like velvet is perfect for pirates. You can choose to leave the buttons undone or to button the vest.For women, add a corset or bodice over your shirt., Pick a pair of boots that are tall and slip on, rather than lace up. Choose black or brown. True Buccaneer boots go to the mid-calf and have a large fold-over flap.


For women, choose boots or shoes with buckles.Pirates often go barefoot as well, so that is also an option.

, No pirate is complete without their hat! Opt for the tricorne (three-point) style. Choose a simple black hat, or go all out with feather details.You can tie a scarf around your head under your hat as well.
Alternatively, wear a bandana.

, Choose a black eye patch, or one decorated with the jolly roger. Keep in mind that wearing an eye patch will weaken your eye, so if you want to wear one, switch it from eye to eye every day.

, Many pirates have lost limbs in ferocious sea battles! “Replace” your hand with a fake hook, or your leg with a wooden peg leg for an authentic pirate look.

, To sound like a pirate, add a bit of rasp to your voice. A parched, gravelly voice is what you should aim for, since pirates often yell at their shipmates and are at sea for long stretches, where clean drinking water can be scarce. Argh!

, Pirates are often drunk and are never concerned with pronunciation. Run your words together, such as “lookit’tha lass” rather than “look at the lass.” Mutter under your breath, saying words like “scallywags” and “lily-livered.”

, Add some nautical terms to your vocabulary, such as “land ahoy,” “on the starboard side.” Pirates also like to say “keep to the code.” You should use words like booty, pillage, buried treasure, matey, plank, buccaneer, landlubber, plunder, lass, scurvy, grog, and savvy.


Do an online search or use an app to learn even more pirate words.

, Use a more casual style, and change “being” to “bein,” “sailing” to “sailin,” “over” to “o’er,” and “never” to “ne’er.”, Instead of “we are sailing,” say “we be sailin’.” Another example is “we be swashbucklin’!”, Examples include “what ye be doin’ boy?” “yar gonna miss the ship,” and “ye better be ready to walk the plank!”, Instead of saying “my parrot” say “me parrot.” Or, tell someone to “take your hands off me booty” rather than “take your hands off my booty.” Another example is “make sail, me hearty!”, Pirates like to exaggerate, so add extra adjectives to your descriptions. Instead of saying “a big ship,” say “a great, grand ship!” Talk about the “no good, lily-livered sailors” rather than the “bad sailors.”, Pirates aren’t happy, peppy people. They look and sound mean and nasty, so get a bit cranky to act like a true pirate., Gesture with your hand when talking and occasionally slam your hands on a table or other surface. Pirates are very emotional, so ramp up your attitude a couple notches.

, A real or fake parrot will do! Perch it on your shoulder and feed it bits of cracker. A parrot that “talks” is your best bet.

, Choose fake weapons so you don’t get into any trouble! Pirates carry a cutlass (sword) and also sometimes a flintlock pistol., Add one or two hoops to your ears if they are pierced. You can also choose earrings with wooden beads., A proper pirate needs a telescope for spotting ships that can be plundered. You can make one out of a cardboard tube., Add a pirate-like swagger in your step. Be confident and a bit sassy too.

, Round up some friends and turn them into pirates too. If possible, get a ship (maybe a raft), sail together, make maps, and even bury treasure!

, If you’re of legal drinking age, make rum your drink of choice. Choose a dark, spiced variety rather than the clear liquor.

Make your attempts to act like a werewolf after a school break or some time off.,
Do not tell anyone that you are a werewolf.,
Find one person to become friends with or if you already have a good friend that works too.,
If you have a group of really good friends that you are sure would join in on the act, ask them if they could join you as your ""pack"" to make it more realistic.,
Ask your family to go camping on the nearest full moon, but don't let them in on the act of being a werewolf or they might send you to a psychiatrist or something.,
Wear forest colors like black, dark green, brown, navy blue, and a little white if necessary.,Act really tired and hungry but strong the day after a full moon,

,
Avoid people but don’t become a friendless psycho!,
Pretend to be vulnerable, weak, and frustrated with your ""lack of strength"" on new moons.

,
Wear natural makeup and black eyeliner.,
Don't shave.,
Stand your ground.,
Always move.,
Watch wolves in a zoo or go on YouTube and view some wolf videos.,
Don’t get a costume, because it will probably make you look fake and cheesy.

,
Avoid being around people on full moon nights, and act concerned the whole day and don't worry too much about other problems; you have your own.,
Improve your strength, speed, and reflexes by trying effective exercises like jogging a mile every other day and lifting a five pound weight up and down for 30 minutes every day.,
If you're a lone wolf, try to keep away from crowds, only hang out with a few number of people.,
Learn how to howl; it isn't that difficult.

,
Eat meat all the time.,
Be afraid of fire.,
Glue some hair to the palms of your hand a day or two before full moon.,Create a pack of you can, this will help make you feel secure if you do, don't do drugs because wolves don't do them.",How to Act Like a Werewolf (Girls)," This will improve the effect that you have been changing over the break.;
, They will think you are insane. If you follow these steps and act correctly, they will think they found out your ""big secret""!

, Follow them, but don’t stalk them, to most places, and in dangerous situations, protect them. Since you are, unfortunately not an actual werewolf with any powers, ensure you do not put yourself or your friend in any danger.

, If they wouldn't, then don't ask, as they would most likely think you are crazy and not be friends with you anymore.

,


If you can, play hooky on full moons and new moons. If people ask you where you were yesterday, act really worried and mumble some excuses.







, Don't wear skirts or dresses. After a full moon, sprinkle a little dirt on your shirt and shoes. Only do this if your parents don't mind your clothes getting dirty.

,, Just keep your distance but remember to be friendly.

,, This will help you draw minimal attention to yourself, but if anyone notices you, you will look natural and beautiful. The dark eyeliner will make your eyes more intense and helps with giving defensive glares at people who might stare.

, Wolves and werewolves are quite hairy. You don't have to shave, so a light coating on your arms and legs would work too.

, If someone teases you, give them a look that says ""No."" and act defensive. A wolf would do the same, but wolves usually engage in a fight, which you should avoid at all costs.

, Wolves are natural predators, and they are always moving and waiting. Improve your balance, grace, and patience to perfect the look of a wolf hunting prey. Though you can do this, make it minimal so people will not be freaked out that you are glaring at them hungrily and hunting them down.

, This will improve your technique. Also, if you own a dog, watch how it plays, sleeps, eats, etc.

,, If someone invites you over after 7:00 or dusk, say you can't and that you have something to do. If they ask what, make up an activity that you could actually do, like ""Oh, I am just going grocery shopping. It won't be much fun."" White lies are okay in this situation, but try to never lie because it could get you into a heap of trouble.

, Play Frisbee to help with reflexes.

, Do the opposite if you're more of a pack kind of wolf.

,, Pretend to crave meat like crazy, but this is only optional.

, Animals are almost all afraid of fire. Don't go near fire and if you see fire stare at it and snarl a little not too loud just loud enough that one or two people can hear it., Pretend to have a really keen sense of smell and scratch like you have picked up the odd flea from running around chasing deer at night.,"

Remember he or she will also be in the same boat as you most likely.,
When you're acting, you're that person, not yourself.,
Get to know them.,
You're in love!,
Don't be afraid.",How to Act in Love With Someone on Stage," Remember the person you're acting with is probably feeling the same way as you, so you can share your worries with him/her. They'll most likely sympathise or help you out, just don't go on and on about your situation.;
, That sounds pretty cheesy, but it's true. You need to put yourself in whoever's shoe's you're playing; think like them, act how they would. Read your lines and incorporate the characters decisions into everyday life, even the lovey-dovey parts need to be practised the same way! You may even want to ask the other person if he/she wants to do the same so you two can get used to each other.

, You need to know who you're acting alongside, so you two can perform well on stage because you know what each others thoughts and motives are, spend time at school with him/her. Talk to them and find out what they like. Practise lines together. Hang out together. Act like you're best friends for a bit, you never know you may like each other in the end!

, Show the audience that he/she is the love of your life, while other people are saying things look into their eye's lovingly, stand beside them, twiddle your hair and flicker your lashes (for girls)

, This is your time to shine, be the best actor/actress you can, if you think people will laugh at you, and if they do, make that an advantage, make it look silly so more people will laugh. Never be embarrassed, it'll be over too soon to feel like that!

Talk to others about their experiences while high.,
Watch others smoke marijuana.,
Try some marijuana.",How to Act High," People who are high often laze around, watching the world around them through half-closed lids. To perfect the dazed and half asleep look, slack your jaw and loll your head slightly to one side.People who smoke or consume marijuana often get lost in their thoughts, and are easily distracted. To really show you have zoned out, act like you are thinking about something totally irrelevant to your surroundings. That way, you can better act like you are detached from reality. You can also express your random thoughts or insight to those around you so that you can really portray the fact that you have zoned out. Try to bring up a topic, random fact, or insight that has nothing to do with the conversation at hand. Act like you have discovered something about yourself or your surroundings that is already very obvious.;
, People who are high from marijuana have delayed responses, so try to respond to everything slower than usual. Let that ball hit you in the face and do things as if your entire world was moving in slow motion. If you have to sit, stand or move, be sure to do so slowly and languidly. Do this authentically -- don't act like you are in a video that has been slowed down. Essentially, you just want it to seem like it is taking you longer to think about things and to make movements than it should or normally would.

, One sign of being high is increased giggling or laughter, usually for little to no reason. If someone does something funny, try to laugh or giggle harder than you normally would. Giggle at things that aren't usually very funny, and act like you can't stop laughing.


Pot often makes people feel happier and more free at first, so giggling and laughing over every little thing will help show that you are relaxed and carefree.

, People often develop growing appetites after they use marijuana.Imagine you haven't eaten anything but lettuce for the past month, and you've just set foot in a food haven where you can eat everything you can get your hands on. That feeling is known in the stoner world as the munchies.


Nutrition is rarely a concern to someone who is high and has the munchies. After using marijuana, a person will often devour the most junk and combine the craziest concoctions available.

, People who are high from marijuana often have red eyes and carry eye drops to counteract the redness or wear sunglasses. If you really want to look like you've been smoking pot, find some creative ways to bring redness to your eyes. Try to stay in darker lit areas so your pupils look more dilated.


If you want to mimic red eyes for as short period of time, rub your eyes for a bit. Then, carry around some eyedrops to act like you are trying to counteract the redness. You can also bring a pair of sunglasses with you and put them on when you are around people, to act like you are trying to hide your redness.
You can also create eye redness by reducing your sleep. Marijuana users are often prone to drowsiness anyways, so getting less sleep than usual will increase redness in your eyes and help you play the role better. You may also be able to find some contact lenses that are colored to look like you have eye redness., Just like they effect a drunk person, poor coordination and judgment make a high person prone to mishaps. Since you can become absent minded and careless while high,you will often wrongly estimate your capabilities and cause accidents. You could mess things up even worse the more you try to be careful, causing one disaster to lead to another and the next after that.


For example, while acting high you could find it difficult to pour a cup of coffee. You might splash hot coffee onto your hand, which causes you to bump the cup off of the table. The cup smashes on the floor, and while trying to clean up the mess you cut your finger, and so on and so forth.

, Sometimes when people are high, they suffer from short-term memory loss. A high person might begin a story or even a sentence and forget what they were saying halfway through. Forgetfulness might also cause a high person to enter a room and forget what they're there for.

, When people are high, they often become fascinated with random objects or movements. After a person uses marijuana, they might suddenly begin to stare blankly at the hands of a clock, a dripping faucet or a spinning ceiling fan. Any repetitive motion tends to catch the eye of a stoner.Just like the zoned out stare, the fascinated stare comes from the fact that you are distracted by something. While the zoned out stare means you are lost in your thoughts, the fascinated stare shows that something in your surroundings has suddenly peaked your interest. Choose an object around you that is moving, and stare at it for a long time, until people start to notice.
Cartoons also are fascinating to high people.Whether it's, ""The Simpsons,"" Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse on the screen, stoners will stare intensely at the television and maniacally laugh at random scenes.

, Mastering a role involves much more than rehearsing lines. To really be able to fool people, you'll need to practice being high frequently. Spend an entire day acting high, and make sure you practice when you are around people.


Use all the techniques in mastering high behaviors in your day. If you are around someone who knows you are just playing a part, ask them to watch you and give you advice afterwards. Make sure you have someone who can praise or critique your performance afterwards so you know if you are doing a convincing job.

, Fill in the blanks left by the writer, and write a bio based around your character's known traits and experienced. Imagine how the character would dress, how he or she would talk, think and act based on the biographical characteristics. This may help you perform better, because you'll have a specific character to go off of.Different people also have different reactions to pot. If you are playing a specific role, make sure you understand how that character responds to marijuana. Some people may be more carefree and giggly, while others may experience increased heart rate, anxiety, or aloofness that leads to depression. While it seems like marijuana is always displayed as the happy drug, this isn't always true., Practice getting into the high character by play acting with a partner, making up only one or a few lines at a time. It doesn't matter where the story leads you, the important part is you act high the whole time, according to the bio you previously wrote about your character. Ask your friend to tell you when you've broken character or when it seems completely posed. Part of a performance involves rehearsing lines and doing takes multiple times, so if you have to rehearse the same lines multiple times don't be discouraged.

, Entertain yourself while practicing for the role of a marijuana user by playing a game while acting high. The activities involved in a card game are redundant, yet sporadic enough to challenge your skills and ability to continue acting high.Not only can you practice acting stoned with a card game, but you can prepare for an audition in the same way. Both social and solitary games of cards will keep you from trying too hard, while helping tap into the right emotional context., The best way to learn how to act high is to watch other actors do it. Plenty of moviesand television showsdepict marijuana users, and you can learn a lot by watching experienced actors' portrayals.


If you're preparing for a comedic role, watch movies such as, ""Up in Smoke,"" ""Half Baked"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car?""
To prepare for a more dramatic role, watch examples of marijuana users in movies such as ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Blow.""

, Even if you don't use marijuana, chances are you know someone who either does or did in the past.Explain to the person you are preparing for a dramatic role, and ask questions about his or her experiences.


You can attain an even better understanding of your friend's memories by asking him or her to reenact their experiences rather than simply describing them.
You can best prepare to act high by recording your sessions. Each time you speak with a person about their memories of being high, record the discussion. You will get an even better grasp of the behaviors by watching the sessions multiple times., If you live in a place where marijuana use is legal, you can see how to act high firsthand by watching others smoke the plant or ingest it through edibles. Pay attention to their mannerisms, actions, speech patterns and behaviors., If you live in an area where smoking marijuana is legal, you can always draw from personal experience by sampling some for yourself. Only try a small amount if you are not an experienced smoker.You can use marijuana in a variety of ways, including smoking it or ingesting it in pot butter, brownies, candy and a variety of other edibles.
Prepare for your role by keeping a notebook during your high experience to later remember your thoughts while high and by recording the session to later watch your behaviors and mannerisms.
Keep in mind that marijuana can have dangerous side effects. Because it slows your reaction time, avoid driving a car or doing activity that can danger you while you are affected by the drug. Marijuana effects usually wear off after three to four hours, so give yourself some time to experience the drug before you try to go out in public. Know that marijuana also increases your heart rate, so if you already are at risk for a heart attack, avoid using marijuana altogether."

Dress evil.,
Understand the reason behind your evil motives.,
Have tricks up your sleeve.,
Have a brilliant yet dangerous mind.,
Be sneaky and isolated.,
Remember that villains do not have friends, they gain followers.,
Develop an evil grin and stare.,
Define a skill and use it.",How to Act Like a Villain1," Black and red are traditionally represented as the color of evil. Evil figures tend to lurk in dark corners and spaces and they often times sneak up behind their victims. Dark or red clothes help the villain camouflage into their sneaky setting. Wearing black and/or red clothing will also visually enhance your dark side.;
, Villains tend to be evil due to their negative past and upbringing. There are reasons for being evil and in most comic books/movies the villains weaknesses define their need for power. Take the Harry Potter series for example: Lord Voldemort heard the prophecy that he will not be able to live if - or so he thinks - Harry Potter survives. Because of the prophecy, Voldemort sets out to kill Harry so he cannot be killed himself, thinking that he could be the most powerful wizard in the world.


Understanding why your villain (the one you are portraying) is evil will help illustrate your actions.
""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another...if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice. Ha ha ha!"" - The Joker from 1988's The Killing Joke. , A villain works to destroy/kill/maim the hero in most movies or comic books and they go about it with ease. Villains are witty and knowledgeable in serious conversations/situations and often times they get away with a trick or two before disappearing to go plan their next move. To be witty and devise tricks:


Watch and study your opponent and play off of their actions.
Listen to what they are saying and reply in a tone that mocks them and insinuates power and knowledge.
Use sarcasm and cynicism in simple sentences as demonstrated in this quote from Loki in The Avengers: ""I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose."", Most villains are extremely cunning and manipulative; they know a lot of things about weapons, gadgets, minds, and/or the society that he/she lives in. Villains warp the truth into their own insane lie; they take what they know, use their intelligent mind, and construct an obscure fabrication of the truth - ending in a result of total manipulation.Take Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness (well... all the Star Trek series, really). Khan explains to Captain Kirk the Admiral is evil and used his superhuman intelligence to construct weapons. After finding this story to be true, Captain Kirk agrees to plan vengeance against the Admiral with Khan (with Khan's promise of truce). Once Khan had Captain Kirk's trust he turned to a plan of his own and threatened the fate of the ""Enterprise""., Villains usually behave in a sneaky manner in hopes of manipulating naive individuals to acquire power/wealth/sex, etc. Although some villains gain an entourage, they are very introverted and keep the important features of diabolical plans to themselves. In acting out the sneakiness of the villain try to:


Lurk around and move with a sly disposition.
Have minimal interaction with the general public or society at large.
Do general things alone and confide in no one.

, It's unusual, though not impossible, to find a villainous character depicted as a self-centered individualist doing his dirty work all on his own (unless you are trying to depict him as a psychopath or sociopath - a la Psycho or V for Vendetta, but this is quite digress-able). They often have an army of minions or bodyguards who praise their path of evil and take on the minor tasks of the villains plan:


Dole out diabolical orders to your followers (if any) while keeping secret motives and actions to play out yourself in your quest of destroying good.
Be sure to expose your power frequently. This will help your followers understand you have control over them and the evil situation and they are not your friend.

, Most villains have evil grins pasted across their faces and they are best combined with a nasty expression. Traditionally, theatricality is extremely important in the art of movie-making. However, some advanced directors can direct villains to show zero expressions on their faces. Case in point: The Devil Wears Prada where Meryl Streep elegantly demands orders through soft monotone voices matched with blank, yet sincere, expressions. But generally speaking, it is important for the villain to show how much they thoroughly enjoy the evil situation at hand as displayed by the character Jack Torrance in The Shining played by Jack Nicholson.

, It's always good to ensure that the villain you are portraying has a particularly destructive skill such as word-play, sword-fighting, gun-slinging, nuclear technology, or political power. Any skill, no matter what, can be used to the villains advantage in an encounter against their foe.

If you catch the good guy, shoot him!,
Don't doubt that however secure you think your dungeon is, you're wrong.,
Don't give your henchmen face-covering helmets and generically-sized clothes.,
Don't label the abort button with the word abort.,
Make sure everything has a backup battery and a surge protector.,
Don't store your evil plans on the computer.,
Don't hire henchmen that can be distracted by a pretty girl walking past the front of your evil lair.,
Don't trust anybody.,
If you have an emergency escape vehicle, use it as soon as the good guy enters your evil lair.,
Don't make a CCTV system with any blind spots.

,
Modify your henchmen's guns so that they fire more bullets than usual.,
Only hire henchmen with, at the very least, basic marksman skills.",How to Act Like a Villain2," Don't throw him into the shark tank, don't lock him up, don't gloat, don't push him down the shaft of eternal fire. Just shoot him in the head, then shoot him again to make sure.

, You can guarantee that somebody will have found a way to escape. If you absolutely must build a dungeon for locking people up, make sure it follows these guidelines:


Don't put in a window. The prisoner can't crawl away out of the window if there is no window.
Make sure all of the walls are as thick as possible. This stops prisoners from scratching away the mortar, pulling away the stones and making a hole in the wall.
Keep the cell keys in a locked box, out of reach of any stick, belt, shoelace or cunningly trained pet.

, This makes it easy for the good guy to disguise himself. At the very least, you need to be able to see the faces of all of your henchmen (I recommend plexiglass visors). Custom-tailored clothes are also helpful, as the poor fit will give the hero away.

, The button labeled with the word abort should do something else, like electrocute whoever pushes it. The actual abort button should be labeled with something inane, such as ""make coffee"" or ""recline chair"".

, That way, if the good guy cuts the power or detonates an EMP, everything keeps working.

, The computer should contain useless (e.g. funny cat pictures) or harmful (e.g. a virus) items, so the good guy can't download your evil plans. The plans should be written on flash paper (paper that has been converted to nitrocellulose) that will burn up almost instantly.

, Usually this means putting a mixture of men and women on guard at the same time, or hiring eunuchs.

, The rank ""most trusted henchman"" should only ever be awarded posthumously.

, Don't hang about, you can always come back if your henchmen defeat him.

,, This stops the good guy from using the old ""count the bullets"" trick.

, Henchmen will either pass target practise or be used for target practise.

Be confident.,
Learn to walk like a model.,
Have your own, unique style that is not tacky.,
Have a few accessories you wear at least once a day, because you should change your outfit whenever you change your mood.,
Figure out the right makeup for you.,
Wash your hair the night before.,
Have fun.",How to Act Like a Model," It isn't as easy as it sounds. The best tip is to fake it until you make it. Walk and talk like you're important (even if you don't feel like it all of the time) and eventually it will become habitual and you won't have to think about it.;
,


High-heeled shoes always help with your posture (and sometimes confidence), and they are best for learning. You should start out with a 2-inch heel and then graduate to a 4-inch heel before continuing on to a 6-inch heel.
Walk normally. Notice the space between your feet as you walk. On the runway, models walk with one foot directly in front of the other. Take a step with one leg, then take another and put the foot directly in front of the other, leaving a two inch space between your toes and your heel. Repeat. Notice how your hips sway perfectly and along with your legs.
Look up. Make sure you are looking straight out in front of you. Always have a face that perfectly reflects your mood, but make sure it's attractive.
Try not to move any part of your body when you walk except for your feet. You should appear as if you are gliding, or flying if someone were to watch you from the thighs up.
Get a thick book like a paperback dictionary, a copy of The Odyssey, or Jane Eyre. Put the book on your head and walk. Make sure you don't drop the book -- this will improve your posture. Who wants to see someone slouching?
Also, watch videos of models walking on a catwalk and decide what version of the walk is best for you. Every model has a slightly different walk.

, Don't act overly 'tramp' like, either. You can show quite a lot of skin if you can still manage to look innocent. Wear a big sweater that still shows your fabulous body shape, and let one shoulder drop off allowing it to be ""accidental"" and totally sexy. It can't look like it was pulled down on purpose - accidental and natural slipping of clothing is much, much sexier. Act like you can't help it and don't notice it. This does not mean that you should let your breasts pop out. That is completely tasteless and may get you arrested. Just let your shirt come up an inch or two on one side to show your tan hip or let one shoulder droop off to show off your impeccable bone structure. Everyone has at least one amazing asset. Show yours off!

, And you should change your mood often. Therefore, you will need heaps of clothes. Keep them in your exotic car or huge designer bag.

, Some people need a lot, some need a little. You have to be able to do it yourself. Go to a department store; have your makeup done at a counter. Ask for a light day makeup look that you can wear every day. Learn how to do what your artist does, and ask for help. You must be able to do your makeup by yourself, and well! Models don't wear a lot of makeup, but a bit of concealer, clear mascara, a bit of eye liner and some light gloss may be right for you.

, That way some natural oils have worked its way down and your hair won't look all frizzy. Part your hair down the middle and make cute really low pigtail braids. Start the braids under your ears and work your way down until there is about an inch of hair left, the tie it with a hair tie. Maybe do it on both sides. Maybe take your bangs and straighten them and put them to the side.

, Models are the ultimate party girls; make sure you get invited to every party. Have your own parties. Be the center of attention. Guarantee that you will be at every good party. Don't worry whether you went to the right party, any party you go to is the place to be. Make yourself look hot - the ultimate party girl looks hot no matter what she does.

Make your character wear darker colors.,
Wear the same clothes a few days before the performance.,
Avoid bright or colorful make-up.,
Don't shower for a few days before the performance.",How to Act Depressed1," While dark colors don't automatically scream ""depressive,"" some people expect it when seeing a performance. If the other characters are wearing brights, try switching to blacks, browns, and grays in your pants and shirts, and people will start to notice.


Switch the type of clothes you wear as well. If other characters wear new or trendy clothes, wear some older used clothes, to switch things up. Worn sweaters and ""indoor"" clothes are good ideas.;
, Your character should wear the same thing repeatedly, as if it were too much work to go about changing. Ideally, it should be something that you feel comfortable in, like a hoodie and your favorite pair of dark jeans, not something that looks super-cool or stylish.


People suffering from clinical depression will often lose interest in activities and behavior that once excited them, and basic upkeep can sometimes become a chore., If you don't wear make-up anyway, go ahead and skip this step. But if you regularly incorporate a bit of make-up into your dressing routine, stop using it. When you're depressed, you start pulling back from your regular routines and caring less about going through the motions, so leaving the make-up in the drawer can be a way of suggesting that you might be depressed., Again, if you're depressed, regular day-to-day activities will start to seem too daunting to take on. You may be too upset and distracted by what you're going through that you'll forget to do things like shower and keep up a clean appearance. If you want to fake it, skip a couple showers during the week and rumple up your hair, as if you can't be bothered to fix it.

"
"
Stand a little part from the other characters.,
Make your resting face a frown.,
Carry around some props.,
Listen to sad and slow music.,
Don't laugh.",How to Act Depressed2," When people get depressed, they'll start pulling back from their friends and family. If you want the audience to think you're depressed, put a little more space between you and the other characters on the stage. If you seem like you don't want to hang out like you usually do, people will get the visual message.


Instead of standing on stage, sit on the floor, in the corner, and hug your knees. Bonus if you've got a hood to pull up on your sweatshirt., Instead of looking open and excited about what other people are saying, try a grimace. Look like you're trying to solve a complicated math problem at all times, when you're really just listening to people talk. You'll look depressed.


If it helps, try focusing really hard on something complicated or difficult. Try to remember all the lines to your favorite song in your mind to distract yourself. Make a concentrating face.
Don't over-do your frown, just furrow your brow and make a face like you're concentrating really hard on something, especially if people are laughing and joking. You shouldn't look like a sad clown, which will be over-the-top and fake looking. You don't want to look like you're acting.

, The right prop can do a lot to communicate that you're depressed. Try carrying around any of the following depressive signifiers:


Books like ""Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" ""The Bell Jar,"" or ""Crime and Punishment,"" which are about depressives.
A cane, as if you expect to need help picking yourself up.
An old tattered umbrella, as if you expect it to rain at any moment.
A sad-looking tattered stuffed animal, as if you just need it.

, To get in the right mood for a performance, try listening to sadder, slower, and quieter music than you might normally be used to listening to. This will have the dual function of getting you in the mood to act sad, as well as clueing anyone who's listening in to the fact that you're ""depressed."" Try out the following acts:


Nick Drake
Elliot Smith
Dashboard Confessional
Nico
Joy Division
The XX
The Cure
Digital Daggers

, One of the quickest and most convincing ways to seem depressed is to stop laughing at things you would normally find funny. Instead, sigh heavily and look down at the ground. If you can't even be made to laugh like you usually did, you'll seem depressed.


It can be hard to stop yourself from laughing, so try to keep a go-to depressing thought in your mind if you feel you're about to laugh. Start thinking about polar bears dying or global warming.
Sometimes, gently pinching your cheek with your teeth, or snapping a rubber band on your wrist can offer a quick jolt of pain that will keep you from laughing, as well. Don't over-do it.

"

Whisper and mumble.,
Be sarcastic.,
Speak less.,
Find the darkness in everything.",How to Act Depressed3," Depression affects your desire to communicate effectively, as well as your ability to carry on conversations.When you're giving your lines, say them quietly, with difficulty. Make it seem that it is hard for you to talk loudly enough to keep a conversation going. Take a long pause before you answer or respond to a question, then sigh deeply and say something along the lines of the following:


""Oh...I just don't know.""
""I don't really care.""
""Whatever.""
""I guess...""

, Respond to questions and conversational prompts as if you've got nothing but contempt for the conversation that's happening. Sneer at simple questions and make everything think that they've done something to raise your ire, even if they're just asking you what you want for lunch.


Sarcasm is sometimes more of a tone than a specific thing to say, but you can always just repeat what someone says to you in a snide tone of voice. ""I don't know, what do you want for lunch?"" is a good option.Roll your eyes a lot when others speak. One of the easiest ways to communicate sarcasm is to act like responding would be beneath you. Stay quiet and roll those eyes.
Don't be mean. It's possible to take your act too far and start to seem like you're angry, which could get you into trouble. Use sarcasm gently and as a last resort.

, When we're feeling up and happy, it feels good to communicate and to carry on conversations. When we're depressed, talking is sometimes the last thing you want to do. If you want to seem depressed, don't say anything at all.


If you're asked a question directly, instead of responding, just shrug your shoulders and look at the ground.

, If there's a light conversation happening, turn it dark, as if you can't help but find the negative in every positive thing. Be a downer on every conversation, even if you have to turn the conversation completely away from where it was going.


If your friends are talking about how much fun they had over the weekend, try saying something like, ""I guess they found a few new cases of Ebola this weekend.""
If your mom asks what you want to eat for dinner, say something like, ""I just read about that guy in Alaska who lived in the bus and starved to death.""

Before you can start acting fabulous you need to look fabulous.,
Walk Fabulous.,
Use your creativity to really develop your fabulous persona.,
Act Fabulous.",How to Act Fabulous for a Day," Try wearing oversized sunglasses, a fashionable outfit, big hair, red lipstick, crazy fingernails, or a hat. You can personalize this part to make it match your style and what your going for. Try to really have fun with this part.;
, Now that you've got your look, you need a strut that says you're the real deal. The trick to nailing this is not about what you do with your feet, but what you do with the rest of your body. Try keeping your shoulders back and your head up while walking back and forth. For a haughty look try putting one hand on one of your hips and slightly moving your shoulders with each step. Watch yourself in a mirror to see what looks best. The main thing here is to look confident. Confidence is key!

, Again, the most important thing is that you sound confident. You shouldn't be using any ""ers"" or ""ums"" in your sentences. Don't stutter or mumble your words, remember to sound definite. Abstain from using slang, but that's your call. You can have lots of fun with this step too by thinking up what your fabulous self is like. Do you have an accent? Do you use french words on occasion? Do you really like to accentuated your consonants? Play around with it until you find the perfect voice.

, You are now ready to act fabulous for the day. To really make an impression concentrate on making everything you do deliberately fabulous. Try to cross your legs when you sit. Smile like you're on top of the world. Stick your pinky out when you take a sip. Laugh fabulously (you decide what that means). Whatever you do just remember to keep your head high, strut your stuff, and be confident. Once you're done being fabulous, you can sigh with relief and be glad that you can be regular great self effortlessly.

Mess up your hair.,
Stain your shirt.,
Tuck in half your shirt.,
Make your eyes look bloodshot.",How to Act Drunk1," When you're drunk, you start to overlook things about your appearance that you would usually care about when sober. Run your fingers through your hair and intentionally mess it up. The more outrageous and disheveled you look, the drunker you'll appear.Having messy hair tells other people that you don't care about being perfect and are here for a good time.
It could also make people think that you've been partying.;
, Alcohol reduces cognitive function.For that reason, many drunk people will drop things frequently. Many times, this includes food and drink. Put ketchup or mustard stains on your shirt and act like you don't notice it or that you don't care.


If someone mentions the stain, respond by saying ""Yeah, I know. I don't care.""
You can use other things to create stains, but avoid dairy products or any other food that would produce an odor.

, Tucking your shirt in half way will enhance how oblivious you look, and people will mistake it for being drunk. Make sure that it doesn't look intentional, or else people won't associate it with drunken behavior. Try to make it look like you just used the bathroom.


Tucking your shirt in half way could be a fashion statement., Glazed and bloodshot eyes are a common sign of drunkenness.There are safe and natural ways to make your eyes naturally red. To do this, rub a small amount of freshly cut onion, menthol, or peppermint oil under your eye to make them appear redder.You can also try crying or blinking several times to make your eyes look redder.
Redness occurs because alcohol can swell the blood vessels in your eyes and makes them appear red.
Make sure that the peppermint oil, menthol, or onion does not make direct contact with your eye.

Work on standing like a lady.,
Learn to sit like a princess.,
Walk like a princess.",How to Act and Look Like Royalty1," As part of their public duties, members of the royal family are required to attend galas and events. During these outings, the royals must stand with excellent posture for hours. Once you have perfected your posture, you will emanate a regal air.


Bring your heels together and turn out your toes. (This is first position in ballet).
Slide one heel along the inner edge of your foot until it reaches the arch. (This is third position in ballet).
Tuck in your stomach, pull your shoulders back, and lift your head up.;
, In an effort to avoid compromising and embarrassing situations, the royals have perfected the art of sitting properly. To practice this skill:


Stand with your back to the chair.
Back up to the chair so that your calves hit the edge of the seat. This will prevent you from missing the chair completely.
Bend your knees as you lower your bottom onto the edge of the seat.
Keep your knees together and slide to the back of the chair.
Slide your feet to one side. Tuck one ankle under the other ankle. This will prevent you from accidentally flashing anyone.
To stand, lean forward, gracefully lift yourself up, and return your feet to third position., Princesses don’t walk, they glide. While their stride appears natural and effortless, it is actually quite technical and challenging to master.


Place all of your weight on your back foot.
As you step forward with your back foot, your heel should brush the instep of your front foot. Your stride should be approximately half a foot length.
Land on your heel, roll through your instep, and end with the weight on your toes.
Repeat."
"
Act like you're drunk but trying to act sober.,
Act less inhibited than you normally would.,
Take a long time to do things.,
Keep an inconsistent pace.,
Stumble when you walk.,
Smell like you're drunk.",How to Act Drunk2," A big part of acting drunk is to embody the feelings and emotional outlook of someone who is drunk. Typically when people get really drunk, they try to act sober to fit in. This can be difficult because you'll need to assume the perspective of someone who does not want to appear to be drunk while still convincing people that you are.Look like you're trying to keep your composure but slip up occasionally and act drunk. You can say something silly or outrageous and then tell everyone that you're sorry and you didn't mean to say it. Don't go overboard or overact. This may tip people off.


Lean against a wall and then stand upright, as if you're trying to regain your balance.
You can say something like ""No, no, I'm totally fine. I don't think I had enough to drink.""
Being loud and socially inappropriate does not necessarily equate to being drunk. However, being accidentally inappropriate can make you look drunk.

, The effects of alcohol can lead to increased aggression, self-disclosure, and sexual inhibition.Be more open and honest than you normally would. Say things that you wouldn't say regularly. Go off on tangents and talk about your childhood. If you're going for the ""angry drunk"" act, then get angry in response to minor things. Act more flirtatious and be more willing to talk about your history and childhood.


You can say things like, ""Onion rings. I remember when I ate my first onion ring. I was seven--no, I was six years old.""
Touch people more often. Touching someone's arm or pushing their shoulder is an act of flirtation.You can make sexually suggestive or inappropriate comments to appear drunker. Just remember not to cross the line and harass anyone.

, Cognitive and problem-solving skills are reduced when there's alcohol in your system. Often, it will take drunk people longer to understand things.Act like you don't understand simple things. You can accomplish this by asking repeated questions or repeating what a person is saying. When asked to do something, take twice as long as you'd usually take, and constantly ask the person for help.


Changing the channel on the TV or a song on a mp3 player is a great opportunity to seem like you don't know what you're doing.
When trying to change the channel you can say, ""I don't get it. It keeps going to the menu. I don't know what I'm doing.""

, Move erratically and go from energetic to drained in minutes.The more inconsistent you are, the most natural you'll appear. Act randomly and surprise people. The more you change your mood, tone of voice, and volume, the drunker you'll look.

, A common theater technique to act drunk involves you envisioning the floor moving under you while you walk.Make sure not to overdo it and lose your balance and fall over all the time because it can come off as fake. Act as if you are slightly off-balance constantly.


You can also lean against walls when you're stationary to give off this effect.
Another approach is to roll back on your heels and act as if you are trying to get back on your toes., You can swish liquor in your mouth, or put it on your clothes. If you don't drink, try drinking a non-alcoholic beverage because they still smell like alcohol. Smelling like liquor will give people the impression that you've been drinking.


Examples of non-alcoholic beverages that still smell like they have alcohol include Miller Sharp's, O'Doul's Premium, Beck's Non-Alcoholic, and Clausthaler Golden Amber."
"
Slur your words.,
Speak slower than usual.,
Be louder than usual and ignore personal space.,
Deny being drunk when people ask.",How to Act Drunk3," Drinking can negatively affect your motor skills and can slur your speech.To slur, draw out parts of the word that you normally wouldn't. Think of how you would talk if you were very tired. If you want to appear very drunk, slur your words more.


You can say something like, ""I absolutely love this party. It's so great.""
Another example would be, ""So what're  you doin' next week?""

, Just as alcohol affects the way you speak, it can also affect how quickly you can talk. When people are drunk, they will speak slower. Listen to the pace of your voice as you have conversations with people and slow it down if you're talking too fast.


Alcohol can affect the speed in which neurotransmitters communicate with your brain, which slows down your speech., When you're in a loud setting like a bar, party, or club, it's natural that you'll have to speak louder than usual for people to hear you over the music. When you're drunk, however, sometimes you don't realize how loud you are because of reduced cognitive function. Shout in people's faces, and get closer to them than you typically would.


If a person tells you to back off then be polite and walk away.

, When people ask if you're drunk, you should act offended but admit to having a couple of drinks. No one likes admitting that they have had too much to drink, so if you openly tell people that you're drunk, they may not believe you. Act defensive, and people will believe that you're drunk.


You can say something like, ""I've only had a couple of drinks. I'm not drunk!""

Stand like a gentleman.,
Learn to sit like a prince.,
Walk with authority.",How to Act and Look Like Royalty2," Like princesses, princes are required to stand for hours at public outings. While at these events, or in the public eye, their posture must be impeccable.

Allow one arm to hang naturally at your side; bend the other arm slightly at your side.
Bring your head and neck forward slightly., Lower yourself gracefully into your seat. Set your feet flat on the ground. Bend your knees and keep them together—do not cross your legs. Rest your hands atop one knee. Sit up straight in your chair—do not slouch backwards or lean forwards. When it is time to stand, raise yourself slowly from your seat., When a prince walks, he strides with decorum and a purpose. As you step forwards, place each foot gently, yet firmly on the ground to avoid stomping. Allow your arms to follow the cadence of your stride. Keep your body and head facing forwards at all times—a gentleman does not twist his body.


Whenever possible, avoid walking in a frantic rush."

A true royal, however, never flaunts their status or brags about their title. Instead, they remain humble and unassuming. You can demonstrate this character trait by:


Celebrating the people around you and showcasing their accomplishments.
Giving credit to those that have helped you.
Refraining from name dropping.
Stopping yourself from correcting others.
Limiting the amount of time you spend talking and bragging about yourself., Princesses and princes are expected to handle every situation with grace and poise. Instead of reacting negatively, she chooses to remain calm, collected, and positive. This conscious choice allows her to remain in control of her emotions, actions, and words. Develop your composure by:


Overlooking minor annoyances.
Brushing off embarrassing situations.
Staying positive through stressful situations., Since royals are high-profile individuals, their words and actions are closely scrutinized by the media and the public. To avoid a scandal, they must choose their words wisely and conduct themselves in an appropriate manner. While it is unlikely that the paparazzi will hound you, if you want to act royal, you must hold yourself to high standards.


Be careful about what you post on social media. Avoid posting inappropriate pictures, videos, and messages.
Think before you speak.
Act in a respectful and dignified manner., Princesses and princes are role models—their charitable deeds inspire others to to be selfless. Royals use their privilege and position to benefit those with less power. They dedicate their time, voice, and money to causes that they care about.


Identify an issue or organization that you support. The issue could be anything, from advancing women’s rights to protecting endangered species.
Dedicate your resources to advancing the organization’s mission. Start a social media campaign to bring attention to the issue your championing.
Allow your actions to demonstrate what it means to be selfless."

Try to walk around the room in neutral, just thinking about what character to become.,If your character is from a book or play, do some research on your character, if not, simply research by watching everything around you

,
Think about your characters' walk, does your character lead with his/her toes, noes, hands, head etc.,
Decide what animal your character is.,Decide what element your character is, then add bits of that element into your character

,Work on whether your characters' voice is high, low, soft, loud, what accent she or he has, what words can she or he pronounce wrong

,
Play around with the character terms name, hobbies, dislikes and likes, her or his background, family, age, pets, fashion sense, how smart or dumb they are, allergies and all that stuff that you would never think important, but really is!

Record yourself reading monologues and short scenes.,
Study the actors you admire.,
Focus on your diction, or your manner of speaking.,
Practice running one line through a range of emotions.,
Practice ""cold readings"".,
Expose yourself to a wide variety of characters, roles, and people.",How to Practice Acting1," You can purchase a book of monologues online or through the internet, giving you hours of potential roles to inhabit. Pick one and practice it 2-3 times, then record yourself giving the speech. When you rewatch it, take notes on where you want to improve, what lines sounded great, and ideas you have to make it better. Then re-do the speech, recording again until you're happy with the results.


Choose a variety of monologues, not just the ones you're most comfortable with. This is practice time, so challenge yourself.;
, Watch and rewatch your favorite scenes. What are the actor's movements like? What words do they emphasize in each line? What are they doing when they aren't speaking? Don't just watch great actors, study them to learn how they became so great.


Would you read the same lines differently? If so, how?
Look up several different actors playing the same role on YouTube, which is common with Shakespearean plays or movies. How does each actor make the role unique and memorable with the exact same lines?, All actors need to be clear and confident in their readings. This is another place where recording will come in handy since you can hear back your voice and detect any unclear phrases. Focus on speaking clearly in a variety of volumes and speeds, so that every word comes out with power and conviction.


Read a monologue or article out loud, but without acting it out. Focus on clear, well-articulated words and phrases and an even pace. Speak as if you were giving a lecture.
Stand up straight, with your shoulders back and chin up, when reading. This allows clear, uninhibited airflow., Acting requires you show off the full range of human experiences, so practice those experiences with a short game of emotional stretching. Take a simple but versatile line, like ""I love you"" or ""I forgot all about that,"" and practice saying it as many ways as you can -- happy, loving, angry, hurt, hopeful, shy, etc. Do it in front of a mirror. Or, record yourself so that you can see your facial expressions as well as hear your tone of voice.Make a list of emotions to run through each time. Are there some that you need to practice more often than others?
Up the challenge by trying to flow from one emotion naturally to the other. What is it like, for example, when a happy person suddenly hears devastating news?
For a masterclass in emotional range, with purely facial expressions, check out Patton Oswald in this short film with David Byrne.


, A cold reading is when you are given lines and asked to perform them without any practice--this is especially common for auditions. While this seems intimidating, it is a great way to improve your skills and become comfortable with improvisational acting, which in turn makes you an even more confident actor.


Focus on reading the line, quickly rehearse it in your mind, then give eye contact to your audience, and deliver the line.
Dramatic pauses are your friend. It is typically wiser to go slower than too fast.
Grab a newspaper or magazine, or pick a short story, and deliver it as a speech.
Look up short scenes or monologues online and launch right into them without preparing.
Record yourself and play it back to get feedback.
This is also a good warm-up exercise, helping you prepare you mind and body for acting., The best actors are chameleons-- disappearing and blending into each and every role. To do that, however, you need to have a wide variety of experiences. While you should watch movies and plays, reading and writing will expose you to new viewpoints and voices that will inform your acting. This is especially important if you're going for a specific role. Go a little deeper, doing research to fully inhabit your characters.Read plays and scripts, at least one a day. When done, watch the movie and note how the actors portray the text.
Study famous characters and monologues. How do they develop and change? What makes them so good? Highlight, annotate, and look up any words you don't know to get closer to the text."
"
Know the script as well as possible before auditions.,
Identify a talent pool before even selecting a show.,
Look for smart people.,
Acting is not reading.,
Notice everything about the auditioner.,
Note physical qualities when casting characters, especially those who work in pairs, or when casting a child role.,
Look at credits, especially ones with bigger roles!,
Take your time casting the show.,
Delay casting if necessary.,
Get a schedule from each prospective actor.,
Have actors sign a contract.",How to Cast Theatrical Roles," You may want to check out professional or amateur productions on video, but be careful not to get locked into preconceived notions of what a character should or shouldn't look or sound like.;
, Be sure you have the talent sufficient to play all the most crucial roles. Don't even think about producing ""Fiddler on the Roof"" unless you have some men who could carry the load of Tevye. You might get lucky when someone appears from nowhere singing ""If I Were a Rich Man"" in a beautiful baritone, but don't count on it.

, Intelligence is one of the actor's most important qualities. When in doubt, it's better to pick a smart person.

, Do not base your casting on how well an auditioner can read aloud. Sometimes poor readers can act circles around good readers. Ask those who have difficulty reading to recite something from memory, even the alphabet, to get a sense of their emotive ability.

, From the moment someone walks in, you can tell if they are a contender. Notice their manner of speaking, their body language, their attitude.

, For example, you probably don't want to cast someone who is 5'4"" to play Romeo to a Juliet who is 6'2"". Then again, don't assume that things might not work!

, Quality of roles is better than quantity. It doesn't take much in some places to get an ensemble part, but large/leading roles show that the actor has ability.

, Once you put someone in a role, he or she may become very attached to it. Better to delay the process with callbacks than to realize after a week of rehearsal that you've made a mistake.

, You may want to select a cast and begin read-throughs before assigning specific roles. That way you can do script analysis and build cast camaraderie in the first few days while determining who fits which part best.

, You need to know when he or she is available to rehearse. Also, make sure the actor will be in town during the run of the show!

, It should state what is expected of each cast member and include a tentative rehearsal schedule.

Practice short scenes with friends.,
Enroll in acting classes.,
Take improvisation classes to improve your reactions.,
Step out of your comfort zone with different types of acting.,
Get involved in any type of film or theater work you can find.",How to Practice Acting2," You can write the scenes yourself or you can pull them from a book. You can even look up scripts online and re-act your favorite movies or shows. The best way to practice acting is to act, so grab a friend and work together to improve your skills.


YouTube has created a market for short, fun scenes or videos. Consider starting a short web series with a friend.
When possible, record your practice sessions, or have another friend watch and give advice on ways to improve.

, If you want to be an actor, you need to study. Pay attention not just to the teacher but also other students. You can learn something from everyone, even if you don't agree with their acting decisions. Think about how you would play each role, and learn from your classmate's successes and shortcomings.


You may end up playing roles later on with your classmates, and you never know when someone will get their big break. Be kind and supportive to your classmates -- they will form your acting community as you grow.

, Improvisation is a crucial skill, even if you never plan on doing improv comedy. This is because improv forces you to react to any situation, and stay in character. Acting is not just about delivering lines -- it is about inhabiting the character no matter what is happening on stage or on screen.If you don't want to pay for classes, you and several acting friends can look up improv games online. Use them to practice in your own home.

, Don't box yourself into one type of role or genre. Not only does this make it harder to get jobs, but it limits your skill set and prevents further development as an actor. Anything that puts you in front of an audience, from movies, commercials, plays, and even stand-up, can help your practice your acting skills.


Paul Rudd started life as a wedding DJ before getting acting jobs, but used the time to learn to interface with a crowd.
Stand-up comedy is basically a one-person show, and you need to write and act out your material by yourself. This makes it an incredible practice opportunity.
Even if you want to be a movie actor, try to perform in a play. The dedicated time in one role and need for consistency is invaluable for any actor., Even if you're not acting, start making connections with people than can help you get on stage. Place yourself in jobs that connect you with directors, producers, and other actors, even if you start as a lowly PA. An old but true cliche is that ""people hire people."" It is not your resume or a faceless email that gets you the next big role. You need to be out in the world meeting people and getting your feet wet whenever you're not acting."
"
Read the script several times.,
Fill in your character's basic backstory.,
Determine what your character wants.,
Practice your lines until you have them memorized.,
Talk with the director about their vision for the character.,
Relate your own personality and experiences to the role.",How to Practice Acting3," You need to understand the entire story, not just your role, to be effective. Remember that your job is not to stand out, it is to a part of the larger story. You need to understand the story, both its themes and motifs as well as your own role, to get to that point.


Once you've got a grasp on the full story, turn to your parts and read them an extra 1-2 times. Now, focus on your character's role and lines.
If you had to sum up the movie in 1-2 sentences, what would it be? How about your role?

, To really get into your character, you need to know who they are. You don't need to write out a biography, but you should figure out their basic story and life. Sometimes you can discuss this with the director, and sometimes you just need to trust your gut. Don't worry about going too in-depth. Instead, just answer a few basic questions:


Who am I?
Where do I come from? Where do I want to go?
Why am I here?, All characters, in almost all stories, want something. All characters have a need or desire, even if it just a desire to be left alone, like The Dude in The Big Lebowski.' This desire is what drives your character throughout the entire plot. It is perhaps the most important factor of your role.


A character's desires can change, but you need to know when this happens in the script.
As an exercise, try and pick out the desires of your favorite characters/actors. In There Will Be Blood, for example, Daniel Plainview is completely driven by the need to get oil. Every action, look, and emotion springs from this unending, passionate greed., You want to know the lines so well you don't have to remember them. You just have to think about how you're going to say them. Get a friend to play the other roles so that all you have to do is play your part. You can then bounce back and forth like a real conversation.


Experiment with the lines. Try them multiple ways. How does this affect the scene?
Memorize the lines before perfecting them. If you keep trying to remember the words, you're never going to make them sound natural.

, Remember that you are there to serve the story, not yourself. Chat with the director to figure out if there are any specific traits, emotions, or ideas they want in the character. That said, you should bring your own ideas to the role as well. Let the director know your own vision for the character, but be willing to include their ideas as well.


If you are going to an audition, pick a direction for the character and stick with it. You won't have time to ask advice and then change the character in the audition, so just trust your instincts., The basics of human emotion are universal. You may have never saved the world from an alien invasion, but you have felt fear before. You've had to be courageous, and you've stepped up in times of trouble. Find the emotions and experiences that relate to your character if you're ever confused how to act. Great actors show people another side of themselves. They are relatable and human, even if the character is nothing like the actual actor.


Start by figuring out the basic emotion of the scene -- happiness, regret, sadness, etc. Then build from there.

Memorize your lines.,
Warm up by singing or running through your lines.,
Wear simple, comfortable clothing and shoes to an audition.",How to Perform a Monologue1," One of the most important parts of performing a monologue is making sure you have memorized all the lines. Starting your preparations early and practicing the lines often will help you memorize them efficiently.Ask a friend or family member to help you memorize your lines. They can read other characters' lines and even quiz you.
Practice your lines twice a day, or more often if you are having trouble memorizing them.;
, It is important that you take enough time to warm up before you perform your monologue. This can be as simple as signing some notes to warm up your voice. You can also warm up by going through a few trial runs of the monologue with an acting partner or by yourself.

, You should perform a monologue in costume unless it is part of a professional or classroom performance. For most auditions, you should show up in clean, tasteful clothing that does not distract. Try wearing a simple dress or a pair of pants with a tucked-in shirt. The key is keeping the focus on your acting, not your clothing."

Make the following items out of cardboard to a size appropriate for the audience.,
Draw a blue Earth on cardboard.,
Draw the Sun on cardboard.,
Draw a spaceship.,
Draw a large black dot on cardboard.,
Organize lighting effects.,
Have child actors hold the various pieces.,
Have the shuttle leaving Earth, headed towards the black hole but not near it yet.,
Change the focus using light, a signal or an adult (narrator) redirecting attention.,
Offer an explanation.,
Treat this as a learning opportunity that encompasses art, drama, creativity, science, comprehension and participation.",How to Depict General Relativity in a Play," If done from a stage, it will need to be large enough for the end row of the audience to see clearly. For the classroom, you can make smaller items and may also be able to use digital projections.


Another alternative is to make costumes for the actors but this may take longer and be a lot harder to look accurate.;
, Cut it out and paint it with poster paints or watercolors.

, Cut it out and paint it yellowy-orange.

, The shuttle is a good choice. Have the spaceship contain a young person, obviously peeking out from the cargo bay area of the shuttle. Cut it out and paint it.

, This will serve as the black hole. It should be placed on a bright background, so that it's easily noticeable early on. Use colored card behind it to help with this. Cut it out and paint the black hole black and if you haven't used colored card, paint some red or orange behind the black hole to illuminate it.

, Or, simply be ready to switch off the lights at one end of the stage or room. If this isn't possible, use a lamp near the Earth end, that gets switched off and perhaps a black sheet to carry over the Earth and Sun when needed.

, Arrange the Earth such that it is on the left. Next place the Sun. Put the shuttle in the forefront. Place the black hole to the right.


In summary, the positions from left to right are: Earth, Sun, shuttle, black hole.

, This will start off by being at normal speed, but strange things will happen as it nears the black hole. Keep the actor moving toward the black hole. As the shuttle nears the black hole, have the shuttle holding actor come to a stop and freeze. This is a true, accurate observation from Earth.


An actor portraying a viewer from Earth can make a statement along the lines of ""I saw the shuttle moving from Earth but now it seems to have stopped completely as it gets near the black hole.""

, This time, the viewpoint should be from the actor holding the space shuttle. Have the actor turn and pretend to eat a sandwich while looking back at Earth. For this perspective, the Earth should be spinning fast (cue the Earth actor to spin the Earth model, not the actor). In the background, have the Cosmos, Earth and Sun grow old, depicted by fading to black (cue the lighting or black sheet), all while the actor still eats the sandwich (make sure that the actor does not finish it).

, The narrator of this play can explain that time is set aside and frozen near black holes. Reveal how special relativity is the same effect, from moving near light speed. Also explain that, from the astronaut's view near the black hole, though frozen in time, they too witness this speeding up of Earth, Sun, even watching the Universe fade to black, before finishing the sandwich.


If time permits, figure out how to depict the Earth orbiting the Sun faster than once a year. It spins like a top, if you can make a prop do that.
If time permits, (this can be presented inside of thirty seconds), explain how each person's cellphone uses GPS, and measures Earth bending space-time. On the roof of your house, there is less warped time (dilated) (bent) but at ground level, there is more bending. Time passes more quickly near something heavy. A black hole is very, very, heavy, compacting the Earth to a golf ball size could create a black hole. Also point out that leaving Earth at near the speed of light makes time do the same thing––the astronaut goes near light speed, eating a sandwich, and the entire Earth, Sun, Cosmos, fade away and lose energy, getting dark.
If time permits, create a pre-play which shows how GPS works and is in everyone's pockets, how the Earth squashes time just as the black hole does, but less, so the nearer to Earth, the more time is squashed (or dilated).

, It is simply Newtonian physics, not a huge challenge, and when broken down in this way, it's also a lot of fun for the kids. They can, in turn, help their parents to see that this is not difficult at all.


Follow up afterward with questions and answers, and perhaps distribute some visually appealing fact sheets for memory prompts.

Start with an introduction.,
Find a point of focus.,
Master transitions within the monologue.,
Be confident.",How to Perform a Monologue2," For an audition, an introduction to the piece is the first part of the performance. Say your name, the name of the character, the name of the play, and the playwright’s name. If you are performing two separate pieces, you will introduce them both at the same time.Try saying, “I’m Rose White and I’ll be performing Blanche from Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire.
In most cases, you will not need to introduce the monologue if it is part of a performance. Instead, transition into the monologue gracefully and treat it as part of your larger performance.

, Once you are on the stage or in the audition space, look for a point of focus. This is important since you will not have an acting partner upon which to focus your language, emotions, and gaze. Try choosing a neutral point of focus that is slightly to the side of or above the audience or casting director.Do not make the casting director your point of focus, as this can create an awkward situation for them as they evaluate your performance.

, A good monologue will have a clear narrative arc, with at least one transition between its parts. Instead of ranting or shouting for the entire piece, make a clear transition between the angry part of the monologue, for example, and the calmer, more introspective part of the piece., Believing in yourself and your abilities is one of the most important parts of nailing the monologue. Perform the monologue with confidence by standing tall, projecting your voice, and focusing on the audience or another focal point."
"
Pick a monologue appropriate to the role.,
Choose an active monologue.,
Pick a monologue you connect with.,
Stay away from trendy or popular monologues.,
Try a funny, lighthearted piece.,
Select a short monologue.,
Avoid violent, offensive, or overly sexual pieces.",How to Perform a Monologue3," If you are auditioning for a play, movie, or television show, you will need to choose a monologue that fits the character you are vying for. For example, if the role is comical, choose a funny monologue. If you are auditioning for a serious role, choose a more dramatic monologue., The piece you perform for an audition or class assignment should be active. It should not be a character telling a story or recalling a memory. For example, you can pick a piece where the character is pursuing something from another character, or discovering something for the first time.Try performing Claudio’s address to his sister in William Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure.

, You will be at your best if you are performing a piece that you are passionate about. Choose a character and a play that resonate with you. This will allow the audience or casting director to get to know you through the material.Consider performing Masha’s monologue about her future husband in Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull.

, You don’t want to show up to class or an audition and find out you will be performing the same monologue as several other actors. Trendy and popular monologues tend to be overdone, and you want to be unique. For example, you might want to stay away from performing a popular monologue from a recent movie or play.If you feel connected to a trendy or popular piece, you shouldn’t fret about it. Go ahead and perform the monologue confidently!

, If you are in doubt about what type of monologue you should perform, go for a lighter, more humorous piece. This may stand out in a sea of more dramatic, deeply emotional, or angry monologues. Being able to make the audience smile, or even laugh, can be a breath of fresh air for those experiencing your monologue.Try Trinculo’s speech in William Shakespeare’s The Tempest.

, When choosing a monologue, err on the shorter side. You might be allotted three minutes for your performance, but don’t feel pressured to fill every second of your time slot. For example, you can choose a two-minute monologue or two one-minute monologues to fill a performance space of two to three minutes., If you are auditioning for a show, a monologue is very much a job interview. Keep this in mind when deciding what monologue you will perform. Avoid pieces that contain offensive language, are overly sexual, or include violence."

Get to know the play.,
Sketch a layout of the floor set.,
Create a scaled model of your set.,
Prepare to dress the set.",How to Design a Stage Set," Before you can begin to design your stage set, it's important that you understand the particulars of the play and the period it is in. Here's what you need to do:


Make sure to read the script and note any specific requirements about the set. For example, certain parts of the play may require your set to have stairs or door placements.
Keep in mind that these details were included for a reason, so ensure that you lay out the set following the author's intentions.
Note the period in which the play takes place. This will help you choose the proper furniture and decorations.
Check to see if you'll need any specific antique inventory in order to match the set time accurately.;
, The typical stage set design needs a minimum of three walls, so consider beginning your layout with these. Here's what you should do:


Place the stage-right and stage-left walls at an angle that allows for maximum set area.
Make sure to include any door openings and windows within the walls.
Sketch where all movable inventory like platforms and furniture will be placed using overhead perspective.
 Once ready, draw another sketch of the set from the audience perspective. Don't forget to include specifics like colours, wall hangings and lighting fixtures in your plan.

, This will help bring your vision to light. This way you'll be able to visualize the way it will look in real size. The model will also enable set builders to get a better understanding of your set and design vision. A scaled model of stage set design can be constructed with particle board, cardboard, balsa wood and model furniture. Ensure that your set is built to scale or you risk dealing with complications when the actual construction work begins.

, This is the most important step in the stage set design process. You'll need to consider several important things here:


Functionality - your set must allow actors to freely move around it. Make sure you design distinct staging areas for the different acts of the play.
Time period - you should also keep in mind the time period in which the play takes play. Dated plays require greater attention to detail and accuracy of the dressing's timeliness.
Stage set details - consider keeping a simple stage dressing, that won't clutter the set and detract the audience from the action of the play. Aim for a well-defined, clean and minimal set to enhance the play's poignancy.

Have a Fund Raiser.",How to Build School Play Props on a Budget," In many communities there are waste-reduction efforts to keep furniture, household furnishings, wood, paint, and building materials out of the landfill. Check your municipality for such programs. Also, if you ask people nicely at your landfill, transfer station, or whatever for what you need, very often they will look out for what you need and put it aside.;
, Very often a paint color is mixed, but it isn't quite right for the customer. These are often available free or at greatly reduced price if asked. Be sure to thank them on your program and send a thank-you card.

, Take some old sheets or canvas drop cloths (very white and no holes) and pull them taut over wooden frames. Make enough to cover the back of the stage. Prime them with a first. Enlist some help from some good artists at your school and make them into your backdrops.


Canvas or another such heavier fabric will make backdrops that are a little sturdier, which lets the backdrops be reused
Backdrops from previous years can be repainted into new scenery, unless you want to leave them generic. Painted bricks could be a city scene, a castle, a cheap apartment, or quite a number of other things depending upon what is around them.

, Find furnishings. For chairs, tables, and desks see if you can borrow furnishings that the school already has around, such as lunch table with a tablecloth over it as a table. Use a school desk as a desk if the style fits, or use some faux finish and make a cutout on some plywood or cardboard and attach it to the desk to make the style fit.


Ask the Custodian. Your school may have a roomful of old tables, old drop cloths, milk crates, and know where to find the best cardboard. Usually, only the maintenance people really know what's over there.

, Remember that objects need to look like and suggest what they are, not necessarily be what they are. Thus, a tree or bush could be cut out of a piece of plywood and painted (be sure to support it securely and to construct it lightly enough to be movable).

, Does somebody have an old sofa, a hat tree, a lamp, and so on?


Take good care of anything that is borrowed, and ask your fellow actors and crew to do the same. Label it if you can do so in a discreet and reversible manner, and keep a list of what belongs to whom, to make sure everything goes home at the end of the last show.
Post fliers around your school, asking if anyone can bring in objects like a telephone, hand mirror, etc. Hold a scavenger hunt. Just make sure that you have permission to use all the objects you collect.

, If you have little or no budget, ask if everybody involved in the play will bring in a little money (say $5 or $10) for props. Even a little bit can go a long way.

, Some prop items can be used and re-used a long time. Things like old artificial Christmas trees, basic cafe-style tables and chairs, wooden crates, plain lengths of fabric, old suitcases and so on are fundamental prop items.

, If you're planning on developing a drama program, start a prop collection so the next prop master doesn't have to start from scratch. Talk to the custodian about what space may be available to keep prop items. Catalog and list what's in there for the next show.

, You can try a bake sale, redeemable can and bottle drive (especially in your own cafeteria) and the like. For the seriously creative, you can pledge you will drop your benefactor's name in the dialogue, offer to send ""singing telegrams"" to unsuspecting fellow students or teachers, or more.

Try to find a place to get the lights.,
Make sure you determine the following information:


Do the fixtures have compatible power connectors?,
Think about the type of production you are doing and what the production involves.,
Choose what type of lights you will need for the effects and ""looks"" that you just thought about.,
Know how to use your lights.,
Think about the size of your event.,
Get your lights and plug them in.,
Think about color.,
Experiment to get the right look.

",How to Choose Lighting for a Small Production," If you want to keep the lights, you will obviously need to buy them. However, many local rental shops will have lights (referred to as instruments or fixtures from now on), as will theatrical supply companies. Many local theatres and auditoriums have lights that they might let you borrow.;
, There are three types of plugs in the lighting world: Edison-like the ones in your house, stage pin, and twist-lock. (In the UK these are: 13Amp-square pin, 15Amp-round pin, and 16Amp)
Do they fit your performance? You don't want to buy huge instruments when you have nothing but stands to put lights on.
Do they need to be dimmed? Some lights are not able to be dimmed.
If you are renting or borrowing, how long can you keep them? The more time you can spend experimenting with your light, the better.

,


For theatre or dance, you will need to accommodate for scene change needs with different light levels, colors and angles. Thus, you need more lights or lights that can change their color and/or position automatically. Use caution though...these ""automated lights"" need special control consoles and are quite complex. Make sure that you have everything you need to support an automated fixture. The best thing to do for a small production though, is to make compromised in the position and color of the lights. Sometimes, you can't always get the ""look"" that you want on a budget. Don't forget effects!
If you are doing an awards show, or lecture, you will probably need just white light in the same spot all the time at the same level. While dimming is a nice touch, lights for this type of production do not have to dim. Think though- do you want to add certain effects such as projection?
For rock concerts, you need light to stay on the band, but otherwise, you are going to probably want a color flashing, crowd blinding, strobing display of light show frenzy! Dimmable lights with lots of color will work well. If you really want to look professional, though, think about elements of the show and what effects you want to add at certain moments. This will really excite the crowd...

, For just straight white light, you can use any of the three basic types of instruments. They are: ellipsoidal, fresnel, and PAR. Ellipsoidals can produce a hard edged beam that is concentrated in one spot. Fresnels (get a price reduction at the rental house by pronouncing it Fur-nel) are more of a wash light and produce a ""soft"" type light. PARs are a cheap alternative to Fresnels. They are best described as old car headlights in a coffee can. They simply produce a nice, round, sometimes (depending on the lamp) even wash of light. Be aware that only ellipsoidals can project patterns and effects. Rock bands should get a lot of PARs and plug them in!

, Ellipsoidals are nice, and very flexible. They can project patterns and shine long distances while keeping the beam of light relatively small. Fresnels produce a softer, more diffused beam with a soft edge. They are great for a wash of color. PARs are the favorite of rock bands all over, but that doesn't mean that awards shows and theatres don't use them. For a small to medium (or really, even large) sized event, you can't beat the cost and flexibility of PARs. They produce a very diffused, un-focusable light to wash the stage on. For dance shows, use PARs as side lights.

, Events using only six or eight lights need to get some PARs and maybe some small fresnels or small ellipsoidals. Remember, you don't need big lights for small venues. For shows using over 15 lights, it is a good idea to expand and have a variety of lights, especially if your event is in dance or theatre.

, Test to see how bright they are and how far they will ""throw"", or shine without losing too much light. Also, see how wide the beam is. Most Fresnels and some ellipsoidal instruments have a ""focus variable"" where a lens can be moved to get a wider/narrower beam. Play around with this.

, For awards shows, don't add any color. For rock bands, keep no color on the performer lights, and very deep and primary colors for accent light. For theatre, you will need to add color very carefully. Try talking to someone who knows what they are talking about. For dance, the same is true. But on the sidelights, use medium tones, and experiment with warm and cool colors (be careful to keep this very low key, unless you want your dancers to really pop out of the stage.

Figure out your Design Brief.,
Design your set.,
Include risk assessment in your design.,
Construct and paint your set.,
Use lighting to bring your set to life.,
Use sound and special effects with the scenery too.",How to Design Scenery for a Stage Production," This answers the basics of What, Where, When, Why, Who, How.


What is the set to portray?
Where will the scenery be constructed and used. Facilities available at the build shop and technical specification of the theatre.
When - Consider the timescales. It's no use designing a huge set if you don't have time to build and paint it or the fit up time and strike time is insufficient at the theatre.
Why - How will the scenery be used. For example do actors stand on your scenery? Does a door need to open? Does scenery need to be designed in a particular way because of the plot?
Who - Who will design, construct, paint? Who else needs to be consulted? For example if lighting needs to be integrated into the set the lighting team will need to be in on the discussions.
How will have started to become clear but this is where you focus more clearly on making it happen. Think about budget, transportation, and hiring or borrowing or adapting existing set.;
, Now you know the 5 W question basics, you are ready to design your set. Think particularly about how the various parts of the set can interact with each other; this will keep your costs and scene change time to a minimum. Using your knowledge of the performance space think about audience sight lines: What can and can't be seen? How you will mask areas you don't want seen? Make your sketches and think about how these designs can be realised in sections which are joined together to create your set. Depending on your experience you may need to be working closely with the Master Carpenter who will be realising your designs and will be able to advise on how to create your vision.

, Remember fall from height is a major risk in any work environment, including a stage/set. As an example look closely at the Anything Goes images; hand rails are present to prevent a fall either side of the set at the top level but careful lighting reduces their visibility. Note also that no hand rails are present at the outer edge of the stairway. Aesthetically the designer didn’t want hand rails. The way in which the treads were to be used by the actors was discussed and assessed with the director and a decision was made that rails were unnecessary. These are the sort of decisions that need to be risk assessed during the construction process.


At the theatre, stage crew and actors must be briefed on the risks and the set ‘walked through’ to ensure safety. Mark hazards clearly and light areas where necessary.

, A quality finish to your design will add realism. See how porthole surrounds and bolt heads with a rust paint effect add realism to this set.

, In the example set, careful lighting enables 'rooms' to be created purely with the addition of scenic props and an illusion of people walking though the corridors of the ship can be created by switching on and off individually lit portholes.

, In the example shown, the set had a smoking funnel which combined with a ships foghorn and seagull noises were used to great effect to create the illusion the ship was moving.

, It's going to be expensive, but there's no way around it. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression.

, Try to find pieces that not only highlight your strengths, but are a little outside the norm. Directors get tired of hearing the year's ""Top 10"" over and over. The same applies to songs, if you're auditioning for musicals.

, If you can't find one, tape yourself and try to direct your own performance. Practice in front of a mirror, just as you would for dance.

Be willing to work hard.",How to Become a Set Designer," Go to school to receive formal education in the arts. Focus on traditional disciplines like drawing and painting. While it’s not necessary to have a degree to work as a set designer, it will help you round out your skills and give you an edge when it comes time to compete for jobs.Art classes will teach you fundamental principles like dimension, focus and composition.
Design institutes and specialized film and theater programs are an alternative to universities and art schools.;
, Practice fleshing out concepts on paper. They’ll act as blueprints for the later phases of the design process. As you draw, consider how each element of your sketch could be brought to life using basic materials and effects.Get in the habit of picking up your sketchbook whenever ideas come to you.
For a set designer, it’s just as important to be creative and versatile as it is to possess strong technical skills., Set design has traditionally been done with pencil and paper. However, more and more professionals have switched to sophisticated design software in recent years. Study programs like AutoCAD, VectorWorks, Rhino and SketchUp to take advantage of the power and convenience that technology can offer.Many television and film studios will expect you to know how to use design software when working on major projects.Computer programs will allow you to create visual renderings of your ideas much faster and in greater detail than drawing by hand.

, In additional to traditional art and computer-aided drawing skills, it will help to be competent in other types of visual design, such as basic carpentry, sculpting and sewing. Each of these disciplines plays a vital role in set design and will come into the picture sooner or later.Being a jack-of-all-trades will help open up more opportunities for you.

, Volunteer to help create sets for your school or local theater company. This will give you your first taste of what it’s like to be part of a crew. Lend a hand with as many projects as you can to get more comfortable working under time and budget constraints.You may not be able to actually design sets yourself on your first few productions. However, even tasks like painting backdrops or creating props will offer you a valuable glimpse into what goes into establishing a scene.
If your interests lie in film and television, trying getting involved in the production of independent films being made in your area., Spend some time working in a related position as a propmaker’s assistant, carpenter, runner. There’s typically a lot of coordination between production designers and these other staffers, so pulling double duty can be a good way to pad your resume and familiarize yourself with other aspects of the business.Working on set in another capacity is also a good way to ensure that you’re able to make a living, since set designer jobs can sometimes be scarce., Put together a collection of your best work. Your portfolio can include concept art in the form of sketches or computer-aided design printouts, along with photographs of finished work. A well-curated portfolio will act as a visual resume when you offer your services to big studio or theater productions.Having a digital or online portfolio as well as physical samples will make it easier to get more eyes on your work.Be sure to include any special titles or distinctions you’ve earned along the way, such as an art director credit for an independent film.

, Get ahold of the scripts for the productions you’re working on as early as possible and break them down scene-by-scene. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification for even the smallest details. While you’re making your way through the script, the gears will start turning and you’ll begin formulating ideas for how to turn fantasy into reality.A good set designer will need to collaborate closely with the writer, director and art department in order to arrive at a specific vision for a scene.The more time you spend dissecting a script or treatment, the more fully you’ll be able to develop your ideas by the time production kicks off.

, Realizing a finished set begins with understanding the needs of the story. Always be asking yourself questions like, “What is going on in this scene?” “What is the exact setting and time period?” and “How does this character live?” Key considerations like these will help you create a set that serves as a believable snapshot of a particular place and time.The set is a vital part of any scene. Think about the ways the characters will interact with it and what central features should attract the audience's attention.
A character’s style, personality and motivations can give you clues as to how best to shape their surroundings.

, Membership in a guild or union comes with privileges like competitive salaries and benefits and networking with prominent important industry figures. It could also prove to be job security in the long run, since credentialed professionals tend to get looked at first for jobs.Some of the more major groups you could join include the Art Director’s Guild, United Scenic Artists and The American Association of Community Theater.
There may be mandatory fees or meetings associated with being an active member of a professional guilds.

, Being a set designer is often a tireless job. You’ll have strict standards and deadlines imposed on you, and there will be times when you’ll have to labor around the clock in order to get a production finished. Make sure you’re up to the task before taking on these challenges.Nights, weekends and overtime are regular occurrences in the fast-paced profession.When things get tough, keep in mind what drew you to the field in the first place. Your passion will help carry you through.

It is easier to start when you know where you want to go. (You don't need an entire plan, just an overall idea). Decide what type of acting you'd like to study first – theater, musicals, improv, television, film, etc. – and research teachers and classes in your area.


Commit yourself to that class for at least six months, give yourself a chance to warm up to it. If you love it, then continue. After you've completed your first class, it's recommended to take classes in other areas to see if you are interested in another type of acting.;
, Although you should take classes and get real-life experience, you can also learn a great deal about acting by simply curling up on the couch for movie night! Study your favorite films to learn about important acting techniques – such as character development, physicality, diction, and reacting – from your favorite on-screen actors and actresses. Going to plays is another great way to study stage actors and actresses. Absorb everything you see!If you want to be in film or commercials, these are the acting methods you should study. Pick your favorite commercials or movie scenes and try to reenact them.
If you want to get involved with theater or musicals, then study plays and musicals. Observe what the actors do right and what they can improve upon. Apply what you learn while watching them to your own acting.

, Acting is more of a community sport than a solo hobby, so get comfortable working with others. Many actors love running lines, talking about their creative process, and sharing stories. Make a few actor friends and learn from them. They may even be able to give you a few pointers or point you to some auditions., Being an actor in a major city like LA or New York City is hard enough for performers with decades of training and experience. If you're an actor with no experience, it's best to start off in your hometown. Nearly every town has a local theater company, and local theater companies are the perfect place to start. You can also try working with student or local filmmakers if you're more interested in movies and television.If your hometown happens to be a major city, that's fine! Focus your auditions in the community theater scene, or the independent film scene. There are still small community theaters in big cities that will allow you to get some great experience.
If you've decided you want to become a serious actor, moving to a major city would be the smart move for you to get the best training. Wait to make this move until you've decided you want to take acting to the next step.

, Local community theatres are always looking for volunteers to help with props, sets, costumes, etc. Being a volunteer will allow you to study actors in rehearsal, will help get you familiar with the acting world, and will introduce you to people in the industry.


Next time the company hold auditions, do a monologue! You already know everyone in the room, so it's the perfect place to start auditioning. They'll most likely give you some good feedback as well., What new actors need more than anything is experience. You'll probably have to start off by doing free work, but you'll gain experience and be able to add each role to your resume. For example, if a local car dealership needs a commercial, volunteer to be in it. Go to local colleges and audition for their plays or student films. Doing these free projects will build your resume and get you into the habit of auditioning and performing. There is no better way to learn how to act than to actually act.Actors typically go on hundreds of auditions, and only get called back for a few. When you're new to acting, the auditions can be bigger learning experiences than actually getting cast for the role. Embrace the learning experience of each audition and ask for feedback from the casting directors.Look online for casting calls. There are a few reputable casting websites for TV, film, commercials, etc – backstage.com and projectcasting.com to name a few. There are also theater auditions on backstage.com.
Look on your local theater websites for casting calls as well as Craigslist.

, As a new actor, it's important that you get experience, take on diverse roles, and build your resume. Even if a certain character is different from the roles you typically play, accepting the role will add range to your resume. This will show casting directors that you are versatile, easy to work with, and excited about being involved in different types of projects.


If you are cast for a role that completely goes against your morals or values, then you don't have to take it. It is perfectly okay to turn down roles that make you feel uncomfortable.
As your career progresses and your resume begins to come together, you can start to be more picky with the roles you play and the jobs you accept. Until then, get as much work as possible!, If you're an actor with no experience, auditioning against seasoned professionals can be challenging and intimidating. This is where special skills can come in handy. Developing skills such as horseback riding, speaking multiple languages, playing tennis, or singing could end up winning you a role over another actor. You never know when a character will come along that requires one of your special skills, so work hard on developing new skills all of the time., Whether or not your dream is to be in commercials, auditioning and acting in commercials will give you great experience working with cameras and on sets. This will serve as great practice for bigger roles in your future.

, Becoming an extra in film is a great way to dive into the acting world and make a little money. Struggling as an up and coming actor can be frustrating, especially financially, so be on the lookout for casting calls for film extras. You'll be able to meet people in the industry and have a movie on your resume.Many extra roles are posted in casting calls online, but you can also contact agencies who specialize in casting extra roles. You'll need to provide them with your headshot and resume. You can contact these agencies by phone, email, or visiting in person. Look up the local casting agencies in your city.

, Head shots are professional photos that every actor should have. Head shots should be included with your audition application along with your resume. Get a few head shots taken so that you have a variety to use for different auditions. Keep them professional, but don't be afraid to show a little personality.Head shots are needed for any type of acting; film, commercials, plays, musicals, etc.

, A resume is a document that lists your acting experience, education, and previous work. Make sure your resume looks professional, as you'll use it for auditions with directors, producers, agents, managers, etc. Filling your resume as a new actor can be difficult, which is why it's important to go on plenty of auditions, try to become a movie extra, or volunteer at a local community theatre. All of these things will make for great additions to your resume.Creating an online portfolio / resume is also important. As technology develops, some directors prefer to look at your credentials online as opposed to a printed resume. Fill out portfolios on multiple casting websites, you never know who may come across your resume.

, A reel is typically a 2-3 minute long video that highlights the best work that you've done in your acting career. It's important to get footage of every acting role you land so that you can add it to your reel. Your reel is a great way to show your acting skills, versatility, and level of experience.


You should have your reel available online and in hard copies.
Hire a professional to make your reel for you. It's an important marketing tool, so your reel should look polished.
Update your reel every time you get new footage. You want your reel to be the best possible representation of you, so keep it updated., Although it's admirable to have range as an actor, it's still important to identify your ""type."" We are all born with a certain look, and there's no denying what you actually look like. It’s up to actors to identify that look, harness it, and use it to your advantage. For example, are you the smart, clean cut young lawyer, or the early thirties slacker guy? Are you the popular girl or the art nerd? Knowing your type can help guide you to certain auditions and can help you to develop your character strengths.You can still play roles outside of your type, but knowing and mastering your type is a great way to break in to the industry.

, It is often said ""It's not what you know, it's who you know."" This reigns true in the world of acting. Become friends with other actors and industry professionals – get people familiar with you. Network with casting directors, managers, talent agents, makeup artists, etc. You never know who you're going to meet or if they'll be able to help you with your career.


As a new actor, you don't need a talent agent or manager right away. Talent agents and managers are beneficial once you have a good amount of experience under your belt and a fairly impressive resume. Network with different talent agents and stay in touch with them as you build your resume – if they're impressed by you, they may be interested in working with you down the line., When you decide it's time to get an agent, do some research online about different agents and agencies. Find a few who you think would be a good fit for you, and submit your head shots and resume with a cover letter explaining that you're looking for a new agent. It can be hard to secure an agent, but if you work on networking and building your resume, it will be a bit easier.


Ask your actor friends, teachers, or anyone else you know in the industry for some recommendations of good agents. If they have any personal connections with good agents, ask the if they'd be able to refer you to them.
Agents get tons of head shots and resumes sent to them daily, so don't be upset if you don't hear back. You should submit yourself to many different agents or agencies, as this will increase your chances of getting a response.
If no agents get back to you, consider revamping your resume and getting new head shots taken."

Don't give up.",How to Become a Stage Director," When you're in high school, get involved in your school's drama department. Some theater departments allow students to direct plays. If you can't direct, get experience doing every other aspect of theater. This will help make you marketable in addition to helping you get into theater college programs.Look into youth theater in your area. A lot of community theaters let teenagers take part in their productions. Look for any opportunities to get experience.
Act in productions and work as a stage manager. Run the lights and the props. Find out what you're best at, and what you love to do best.
Ask your teacher for a realistic assessment of your talents.;
, Theater is, of course, highly literary, and the main part of a director’s job is to interpret a written text.If you want to make it as a director, you need to feed your passion for drama by immersing yourself in it. Reading will help you to develop your ideas and approaches while giving you a deep well of knowledge to draw on. By reading about the context of your favorite plays, you will learn much more about them, which will feed into your ideas about how to direct plays.


Read plays, novels, screenplays, and adaptations, as well as literary criticism, history, and biography.Take one of your favorite plays and try to develop a deeper understanding by reading around it. For example, if you love Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, read some of his other plays and novels to get a fuller understanding of him as a writer.
You can also read some biographies and literary criticism, as well as social or cultural histories about the time and place in which he lived and wrote. Ask yourself how this extra knowledge can inform your interpretation of the play.
Imagine you are trying to explain a character to an actor, and write down some thoughts on how you would do this for practice.

, If you want to be a stage director, you should go to the theater as much as possible. See as wide an array of plays as you can to broaden your knowledge and give you an insight into staging and production. Go to every kind of theater you can, from the best theater in New York to a tiny community or school theater in a small town. The more plays you see, the more knowledge and understanding you will have.See a variety of plays. See classics, experimental, children's, and musicals. Even if the play is terrible, you will likely learn something.
Go see different adaptations of the same play. Seeing the way different theaters perform the same play - or plays by the same playwright or from the same period - can teach you a lot about directing.
See plays in other countries. Translate plays from other languages if you can. This can give you a unique perspective on the theater world and performances.Many theater productions have question and answer sessions after some performances. Attend these sessions and ask questions, or listen to the playwright, director, and actors discuss their process., Directing is very hands-on and practical, but a director will have a bachelor’s degree in theater production or some related media or arts field.Decide which schools will be the best for your career goals and your financial situation.


Find a city with notable theaters and theater programs. Charleston, Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Portland are all great cities of the arts with good training programs.
Think carefully about what you want to study, and speak to people in the departments you are considering.
Directors include graduates in drama, English literature, music, creative and performing arts, and foreign languages. Other humanities topics such as history, philosophy, and psychology can all be a good foundation., If you can't afford a prestigious university, go to a state college with a thriving drama department. Although there will be some prestige attached to famous institutions, a state college with a very active department could be a great place to get lots of hands on experience in a variety of settings.


While at the state college, make sure to build your resume by participating in theater productions, summer institutes, community theater, workshops, and anything else you can find.

, Some performing arts schools have master’s programs in directing, which can be excellent way to learn the skills if you studied something unrelated.With a bachelor’s degree, you can start a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) course. These can be highly selective, and will include extensive study of theory and criticism as well as practical skills.If you have a relevant degree and a reasonable amount of experience, graduate courses are certainly not essential, and can be very expensive.This could be particularly appropriate if your first degree is in a topic quite far removed for theater and drama.

, Keep looking out for and attending workshops, drama labs, and short courses even after you graduate. This will help you to constantly develop and will introduce you to new ideas and new people all the time. The theater is always changing so refreshing your education regularly is a good idea., Directors acquire a lot of skills through experience and practice. When you are studying, you can work with your friends and fellow students to produce and direct plays. It will be a great chance to experience what it’s like to produce a play with no budget, and you will learn a lot about collaborating and improvising.Becoming a member of the drama society will also help to get to know lots of people who have similar interests.

, Look beyond your courses for opportunities to become involved in theater in your city. One way to get an insight into how a theater runs is to work as an usher part time while you’re at college. You’ll come to know audiences and staff and maybe meet some people who can give you good advice.


You can also get involved in local amateur drama groups as a volunteer.
With smaller community groups, you may find that you will be given more responsibility and more opportunity to contribute to all aspects of productions.

, Try to get involved with local programs during the summer break. Ask your professors to help you find them. It doesn't matter what you do there; just get in and do something - acting, stage managing, handling props, lighting, set building. Do whatever and as much as you can.


Make a great impression on the people who run the program because you will need their recommendations later on.
Look for opportunities with summer stock theaters.

, Keep an open mind and try to get involved in all aspects. You will learn valuable lessons that you can take with you. Learning how to change a set, run lighting and arrange costumes are all skills that will help a director.As a director, you will be better able to communicate with all the specialist staff if you have some experience with what their work entails.
At all stages of the game, tell everyone you are ""learning to be a director,"" not ""I want to be a director."" Ask everyone in charge of anything to ""teach me how to do that."" People love that, and it shows the right state of mind. Be humble, but not shy or retiring. Show your passion without your ego.

, To be a good theater director, you must love and enjoy being around actors. Meeting actors and talking to actors helps you begin to understand what role they will play in the theater production. Start to learn about the relationship between a director and an actor. Take this time to understand the creative process of an actor so you know what they go through every night.Consider taking acting classes. This helps you go through the same processes that actors will go through, so you can put yourself in their shoes.

, One the main things that directors have to do is deal with people. You have to inspire them, but more important, you have to make people do what you want them to do. Sometimes, that means making people play roles they may be unhappy playing. Learning how to relate, talk to, and inspire people will help you be successful., There are plenty of organizations and networks out there for young aspiring directors. Being a member of a network will help you stay in touch with your peers and will make it easier to stay in the know about news and job opportunities.It can also be nice just to talk to people who are experiencing the same thing as you.
You can join a relevant union, such as the Actor's Equity Union, to keep updated on news in the industry.

, Many directors get jobs through networking and contacts. After college, move to Los Angeles or New York or another town with an active theater community. Visit the little workshops and theaters until you are able to land a job doing something. During this time, keep meeting people and making contacts. Keep a list of these contacts, and keep in touch with these people. This will help you as you start directing.Try to move up the hierarchy, and if you have acting talent, try to get parts. If not, continue stage-managing and learn all you can.
Acquiring a broad range of experience is very helpful for your directing skills and can help pay the bills as you develop your career.
Always be on the look out for a place at the next-best theater and try to move up the ladder in size, prestige, and quality of production.

, Working as an assistant is a great way to get your foot in the door and experience what life is like for a stage director. If you respect a local director and would love to work for that person, write him/her a letter with a CV and some information about yourself. Say what you can bring to the table, and why specifically you want to work with this director.It’s possible that people will offer you unpaid work assisting as an intern. This can be great experience, but isn’t sustainable in the long term.
As an assistant, you should be dedicated and enthusiastic, but keep in mind that you don’t want to stay an assistant forever. Try to keep your career progressing outside of your assistant job.
While you should be committed to your director, be sure you don’t end up mimicking the director in your own approach. Don’t lose sight of your own voice and style.

, The early career of a stage director is almost always going to very difficult and frustrating. Keep an open mind about work and think about what kind of roles could help you develop your skills and experience.


Investigate running youth workshops, or working on community theater projects. Look for any avenue to get experience and contacts.
Bear in mind that it will most likely take years to become a full-fledged director with a reliable income, and that many people never achieve it., Playwrights are the creative brain behind plays. Start meeting playwrights, getting to know them, and talking about their work. Talk with them about their process, and get them to help you understand the play better.


The more playwrights you befriend and meet, the more your name is put into the theater world. Think about this as networking. Interacting with playwrights can help them get to know you so they can ask you to direct their plays., While making ends meet, don’t lose sight of your goal. Get together with some of your like-minded friends and peers and form a company. Don’t worry about the size, and remember that throughout the history of theater small companies have been essential. It is part of the essence of theater.Forming your own company is great experience to help you learn how to direct and how to work with the other members of a theater production., The next step is to put on a show which you direct, somehow, somewhere. Perhaps the theater with which you're affiliated will let you direct a little show, or perhaps you and your friends can rent a theater and present your own. Sometimes, directing children's plays can be a good step.


A children's play can be a lot of fun, and you might find you really enjoy working with kids and would like to develop these skills.

, This is a crucial skill to develop. You will have to spend time fundraising for the production.You will also have to market your play to attract an audience. These are duties that go beyond working with the actors.


Learning about how a theater's finances function and the costs of staging a play are crucial parts of your practical education.

, You will learn so much from the experience of actually putting on a play independently of your school or college. Analyze what you do and make notes on how to improve. Think about your interactions with everyone involved, from actors to set designers. One of the most important things you will learn is how to work with a large group of people, many of whom will be working for little or no money.


Understanding everybody's motivations for working in the theater will help you work together.
Evaluating the financial results will show you how much the play really cost, and highlight if you need to do more work on fundraising or on attracting larger audiences.

, Becoming a theater director is a long, grueling process. It's about finding and making opportunities and hard work, but also entails ability and a little but of luck. Be prepared for setbacks and struggles along the road, but keep your enthusiasm for the theater.


One way to do this is to keep discovering new things in the performing arts and exposing yourself to them. This will help you stimulate ideas, which will all contribute to the development of your own unique directorial vision. Go to conferences, workshops, and other events to constantly learn and expand yourself.
Read specialist publications on new theater and criticism to refresh your ideas.

Find classes in your area to increase and practice your skills. This is also a great way to meet other professionals and aspiring actors.Consider a degree in theater from your local college or seek out classes at your local theater.
Colleges with highly respected acting programs in New York include Juilliard, Columbia and NYU.
Training programs are also available throughout New York City. Some respected companies are HB Studios and Atlantic Theater Company School.;
, Most of the shows on Broadway are musicals. This means that not only must you be a good actor, but you will need skills in singing and dancing. Find a dance school which offers training in all of the different styles of dance used on Broadway, including ballet, tap, and jazz.The more well-rounded your dance abilities are, the better you will be able to adapt to the style of any show.
Keep up with your dance practice. You can begin to lose strength and flexibility if you don’t dance and stretch regularly.

, Once you can sing, dance and act, the theater world will deem you a “triple threat.” You will be able to provide everything required of a Broadway actor. The best way to train your voice is the personal attention of a vocal coach, who can find your range and fine tune your skills.Look for coaches at your local colleges.
Consider asking a music director to work with you personally.

, This will help you gain experience and build your resume. Gaining experience onstage is important to growing as a performer, as well as creating a name for yourself. If you are available for a role, take it and perform to the best of your ability, no matter the size of the part.

, The director is there to help you and the other actors come together to tell the story. Listen to what the director says and perform your part. Learn from every experience no matter how small the role may be.


If the director is not giving much feedback on your performance. Ask specifically for input. Explore your role and ask questions about your character and performance.

, Headshots are photographs of your head and shoulders. Actors are required to have both a headshot and resume when submitting for a role. Headshot used to be black and white, but the current expectation is that headshots are full-color.


Make sure the picture is current and looks like you. If you age or change your hairstyle, you will need to get new headshots.Bring several different clothing options to the photoshoot and have pictures taken wearing different shirts. Don’t wear distracting patterns or colors. Keep your outfit simple so the focus is on your face., An acting resume should include your contact information, body specifications, experience, training, and special skills. List your most recent roles first and work your way backward.Your name should be at the top of the resume and in the largest font.
If you are a member of an acting union list the abbreviation for the union after your name.
If you have an agent, they will give you a stamp to add to your resume to replace your personal contact information.
List your height, weight, hair and eye color, and make sure that it is accurate.
Never lie on your resume. Only list work you have actually completed.

, Find the auditions in your area and go to any which are offering a role you would fit. Auditioning itself is a good way to continue working on your skills. It is an opportunity to perform for influential casting directors and artistic directors. You can find auditions through postings like backstage.com, on the “call board” at the AEA office, or your agent can search and submit on your behalf.


Be prepared to deal with a lot of rejection. There are any number of reasons you may not be the best fit for a particular role, and there are a lot of other actors looking to make it on Broadway. The competition is abundant and you will audition many times without being offered a role.Treat every audition seriously. Even if you are not a perfect match for this role you are auditioning for, you can impress the casting agent or artistic director who may then call you in for another role in the future.

, The best way for Broadway producers to see what you are capable of is to see you in action. Perform onstage off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway on your way to Broadway. Start making a name for yourself as a performer to get closer to Broadway.

, A bio, or biography, should consist of about four of five sentences and highlight your past work as an actor. It is a little blurb which allows the audience to learn more about you and your career. If you have a lot of acting credits, choose four or five of the top performances or roles, and mention that the ones listed are some of your favorite roles to date.Although you will be writing the bio yourself, you should use third person vernacular like “he” and “she.”
List your achievements, credits and performance history using full sentences rather than a literal list.
You can include your training, and some personal information to endear yourself to the reader.
You can also list film and television credits in a theatrical bio.

, You may be able to audition for a Broadway show if you live in a major city which is hosting auditions, but if you really want to make it on Broadway, you should live in New York. You will be more available to your agent and have many more auditions available to you.New York can be very expensive. Be sure that you have savings to last you for several months once you arrive. The average monthly rent on a 900 square foot unit in New York City is $2815. Add utilities and the higher cost of food, and you can plan on needing at least $3500 per month.
Many people live on the outskirts of the city in Queens or Brooklyn, and some even live across the river in New Jersey. These can be cheaper options than living in Manhattan, and the public transit system makes the commute quick, easy and cheap.

, Actor’s Equity Association, also referred to as Equity and AEA, is a union for actors in America. It’s purpose is to provide protection for the professional actor and enforce guidelines regarding pay, breaks, insurance and other professional needs. On the other hand, many professional theater companies will only use Equity actors, especially in leading roles, as a way to weed out actors with less experience.In order to join you must first be eligible. You may be able to join if you are cast in a production under an Equity contract.
You may be allowed to join Equity if you are a member of one of their sister unions, SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA, or GIAA. You must have been a member for at least a year, remain in good standing and have performed a significant role under their jurisdiction.
You can register as an Equity Membership Candidate, or EMC, to earn credit toward membership by working at an Equity theater. The cost to register is $100, and you must work at least 50 weeks in an Equity house to become eligible to apply for membership.

, Broadway stages often only work with talent agencies when they are looking to cast important roles for a Broadway show. Using a talent agent helps streamline their process, since the agent will knows their actors and can submit only the people who they know could fit the role. Having a talent agent is going to be necessary to getting in the door of a Broadway audition if you want a lead role.


Submit your headshot and resume to agents in New York City along with a cover letter.
Ask other actors which agent they use and if you can use that actor as a reference in your cover letter.
Invite agents to come see you perform when you are in a show.

, Your performance onstage is very important, but your behavior off-stage is just as important if not more important. Broadway professionals and casting agents all work in the same circles. It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role.Protect your reputation by being on time, following direction, and being respectful to everyone on the cast and crew.
Emotions are a large part of theatrical work. Do your best to keep the emotions in the performance and stay logical and collected when you are dealing with others off-stage.

They definitely have expectations for the production and for you, so start off on the right foot by asking what those are!


Are there any duties they want to do themselves? Some directors like to take things into their own hands. How do they want rehearsals run? Do they have any specific guidelines you should be aware of? And be sure to establish a routine where you two or three can check-in with each other post-rehearsal.;
, Months before rehearsals begin, you'll need to start scheduling and coordinating. A good stage manager can take in all of the scheduling needs from the director, music director, vocal director, choreographer, fight choreographer, dialect coach, movement coach, production manager, costume designer, etc. and reasonably accommodate everyone's needs in a timely manner. Basically the stage manager is a miracle worker. You'll need to come up with the following:


Contact sheet
Rehearsal schedule
Email lists
Conflict calendar
Production calendar
Daily Reports
Properties List (keep updated)
Set Design communicated to all staff (keep updated)
Furniture and Set Decoration list (keep updated)
Costume plot (keep updated)
Set dates for production meetings.

And this is just the paperwork prior to the run...



, He or she is probably the one that'll give you a set of keys. How else will you be able to do your job? Talk with them about what they see as the biggest obstacles in the show and what you should know about the set up of that specific theatre.


Take a thorough walk around the theatre, familiarizing yourself with everything from emergency exits to the most convenient trash can. This theatre will be home for the next few months -- the quicker you get to know it, the easier your job will be.

, Since you're basically Anne Sullivan and the show is Helen Keller, you need to be prepared for anything. When anything goes wrong, even the director won't be the one everyone turns to: it'll be you. So stock your kit with everything you could possibly need. But here are a few ideas to get your started:


Band-aids
Batteries
Chalk
Erasers
Paper clips
Pens
Ruler
Safety pins
Scissors
Small sewing kit
Stopwatch
Tampons

, This starts off with the script blown up in a binder. Make it one-sided, hole punched on the right. That way on the left of the binder you have the script, and to the right of it you can place a blocking sheet (hole punched on the left). If you have a ground plan of your set, add that in too.


You don't have to do it just like this, but you should have something similar. Having a book that has everything you need will keep you sane. Include post-it notes or other markers to make everything easily accessible.
Blocking sheet templates can be found online. You should have a template for everything, really.

, This show is your baby. You need to know when a ""the"" gets dropped, when a prop enters a line too late, when the spot is 6 inches (15.2 cm) to the right, etc. Knowing it so well you can see it when you close your eyes sounds stressful, but it makes everything so much easier. Knowing the script will help you:


Generate a scene breakdown
Make a prop plot
Know all costume needs

Be sure to have this done before or during ""prep week"" -- the week before rehearsals start.



, Line up the crew that will be working the show and clearly communicate what you know of the show needs to them. Everything is still in its preliminary stages, but the sooner you know you have other people you can depend on, the quicker you can relax.


Your ASM (assistant stage manager) will be your right hand. When you can't be in two places at once, they'll be getting the job done. You'll also need crew for lights, sound, props, and working backstage. The size of your production will determine how many people you need.

, After a rehearsal, you basically need to be Rainman. What was that blocking note that the director gave around 7:45? Boom, you have it written down, no worries. You'll be taking notes on blocking, choreography, length of scenes, notes for rehearsal report, lighting and sound cues, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It seems like overkill until the one time when the entire show hinges on something you have written down on page 47 of your book.


It's imperative that you have a good system of shorthand down pat. And it should be legible if, God forbid, you ever get sick. So besides the standard USL, DSR system, get something consistent down for blocking and choreography patterns and all cues. That way you won't be scrambling 32 counts behind.

, Every show has that person who's notorious for being late. It's your job to call them up and make sure they're not dead and if they're not dead to chew them out for being late (in a civil way, of course). When everyone and everything's ready, you get the show on the road. When the city wants you out of the building, you're keeping an eye on the clock, too. Otherwise these things will go on for hours.


You're calling breaks, too, and making sure one person with authority doesn't hog all the rehearsal time. Basically you keep things ticking. You're the time and the timekeeper.

, For some theatres (and provided you're not working a dance show), you'll be the one on book. That means when an actor drops a line, you call it out. You need to constantly be focusing and following along. If an actor doesn't know a line and you're not there to pick up the slack, you're losing seconds constantly and you will end up being behind schedule.


""On book"" means you have the script in front of you. Everyone else may be ""off book,"" but you're the one ready with the script because just because everyone is off book doesn't mean they should be. And for the record, actors drop lines all the time.

, With your props master or mistress, you'll need to coordinate something for rehearsals. They may or may not be the real props, but you'll need something akin to what the actors will actually be working with when the show opens. Requests will naturally crop up as rehearsals progress and you'll need to provide something shortly thereafter. But you know the book so well, you saw that coming, right?

, If you're lucky enough to be working in the theatre the show is going up in and you're lucky enough to have a design and the actual props to work with, you'll need to have the stage spiked. That means putting that cool glow tape on the stage where the set pieces go. What colors do you want to use?


Make sure to spike the upstage side of every piece. You don't want tape chillin' in front of every piece you have onstage. The audience might notice that.

, There will probably come a time when your director wants Sheila to exit stage right, make a quick change, and enter stage left fifteen seconds later. There will be other times when your director tries to design a hazard symbol from memory and, unbeknownst to her, it turns out more like a flower. It's your job to kill her fierce display of obliviousness -- you have to chime in for the good of the show. If something isn't possible or correct, speak up.


However, it's not your place to offer artistic vision. The only time your opinions should come into play is when the director (or someone similar) asks. You're logistics here, letting them what will work and what won't -- not what vision you think the director should have.

, Obviously, your hands are going to be quite full, and that's one heck of an understatement. Because of this, you need to delegate. That's what your crew is for! Think of the ASM as assistant to the stage manager. Call the shots. Don't be worried about coming off as bossy -- the show needs to go on and you can't do it all yourself.


An easy job to delegate is to make sure the rehearsal space is safe. Sweep (and mop, if necessary) the stage before rehearsal and make sure all is kosher afterward, too. Especially if you're renting the space!
Reset the stage between each scene. Each night there will probably be several scenes that are being rehearsed; it'll be quickest if you or someone on your crew resets the stage instead of watching the actors fumble with things they shouldn't be fumbling with.

Be hands on and ready to pitch in on everything. There is no such thing as ""not my job"" or a job that's beneath you. This shows that you are not afraid to do a little grunt work and might ensure your job.



, After each rehearsal, you'll need to send out a rehearsal report to all the necessary authorities (producer, directors, etc.). You have a template for that, right? It's in your prompt book? Cool. Talk about any issues, things that will be solved and changed tomorrow, timing, things that got done, notes for each department, and so and so forth. And then email it away with your handy dandy email list you made six months ago.


If there are injuries or one of your actors end up in the ER, you have to hold replacement rehearsals to put in a replacement. This will mess up your schedule, but you'll make do.

, It's not enough that you've scheduled them, you gotta keep them on agenda, too. That means discussing budget, safety, publicity, allotting time for each department to chime in, and making sure the calendar is out for the next meeting. And you should probably take a few notes on this too (depending on how well everyone gets along, you know).


Sometimes certain departments will be absent. You are the eyes and ears of the rehearsal hall and your job is communicating clearly and effectively to all of the production departments what is happening in the rehearsal hall and what the director wants. You never want anything to be a surprise come tech week. All departments should know what is happening and what affects them.
There will be a company meeting at the beginning of tech week that you'll be running. That's when you field any last minute questions or concerns, talk about ticketing, emergencies, etc. Run over the procedures and policies of the theatre and let each department add final notes if they'd like.

, Kinda like a funny joke, right? Now you've gotta make your run sheet for your crew, the tech schedule, blocking script, prompt script, and a calling script (production script). But the good news? That's it for paperwork! Well, apart from the stuff you fill out every day.


Your run sheet is a sheet describing what the crew has to do. Keep it as simple as possible yet still discernible by anyone who walks onto the job never having seen the show before. Basically, you write the cues, what pieces move and where. That's it.
You're calling the cues for sound, light, fly, motor, and stage, so you'll need a calling script for yourself.

, Are all the actors and crew present? If not, call 'em. If so, great. Now you have to make sure the deck is swept and mopped, everything is preset for the top of the show and it's all ready to go. If there are any hitches, people will probably come to you. It'll change every night.

, You're still the clock, even though you're out of rehearsals. Keep everyone posted on the countdown. Let them know at a half hour before that the house is open. Let them know it's 20 to places. 10 to places. 5 to places. And, finally, places. And make sure they say, ""Thank you, 10!"" (for example) before you assume they've heard you.


You'll also probably be letting everyone know when the stage is open and closed (for things like flying and whatnot), when physical and vocal warm ups are, etc. Basically when anything happens, you alert the masses.

, If you have a crew of veterans, this won't be that big of a deal. But the odds of everyone being seasoned aren't great! Assume they could all use a brush up and go over headset protocol. Here are a few things:


You will say ""warning"" and the cue number and whom it affects (""warning on deck cue 16,"" for example). The affected person should then say ""Thank you, warning.""
After a warning, you will say ""standby,"" as in ""standby deck cue 16."" The affected person should then say, ""stage left,"" or ""lights"" or whatever their department is. When a standby is called, there is no more talking.
When it is time for the cue, you call ""GO."" There is no response to this. You are the only one allowed to call the final go.
Headset banter is a natural part of working backstage. It's a great part. Just know when it's appropriate and when it's not.

, Every night you'll have a front of house info sheet to fill out about ticket sales and box office issues. Your house manager and you will work out a system. But for their sake, keep your routine habitual. Try to show up at the same time and place each night so they can predict how things work with you.


Co-ordinate with the front of house manager of when to open the house (generally half an hour before) and when to start the show. Do you hold the show by 5 minutes because the line at the box office is huge? Patrons can't find parking? Is it raining? They'll let you know if anything out of the ordinary is happening out front -- it's just as important as what's happening in the back!

, That headset protocol we talked about? That's the stuff you'll be using to call the show. So at 5 to places, you'll head up to the booth (or wherever you're calling the show from), and your team will assemble. You've talked to the front of house, the headsets are on, the audience is ready, and you're ready to call cue 1. Curtains open!

, This is used to tell the production team how it went, the length of the show, the house count, and any problems or anything that needs to be fixed before the next show. With any luck this'll be totally repetitive every night and you'll be able to do it with one eye closed and an arm tied behind your back.

, You may think years of being a techie is adequate preparation or taking a few classes in high school or college, but it's no substitute for working with a good SM or two. As you can see, SMs have to have people skills, technical skills, foresee problems, and be organized as hell. This position obviously takes a very precise type of person!


While, yes, a good SM can locate a screwdriver in seconds and get to working on a breaking set piece, they can also coordinate with directors and actors -- two very different types of people -- and predict their problems. A good SM has multiple types of intelligence, quite obviously.

, Fine line, huh? You must be likeable but also be able to maintain your authority so that the cast and crew listens to you and respects you. If you aren't likeable no one will ever want to work with you again; if you aren't respected as an authority you cannot ensure the safety of the cast and crew. As you can see, you are an integral cog in the machine of the show. If you don't lead, chaos will ensue.


Establish control from the very first audition. Though a stage manager should not be feared, they should be respected. No need to scare people into listening to you, but don't be afraid to be firm when you need to be. Expect respect from the beginning of the process and respect the ones around you as well.

, It's important that you have the keen ability to maintain the artistic and technical integrity of the show. It is your job as an SM to maintain the director's vision during the performances of the show, whether there are 5 performances or 500. If things change, you need to rein 'em back in.


Even if you disagree, it's still your job. Does the director want the scene lit so dim that you can barely see the actors? Well...okay. Sure. That's how it's going to work for the rest of the run -- even when the director doesn't show up.

, If you don't do anything else on this page, take this one little grain of wisdom seriously: It's absolutely imperative that you stay calm. If you lose your cool, everyone else will too. The show will go on, it will be okay, no one will die (probably). So set a good example and stay calm. You have an entire crew that will tackle the problem.


Let's say it one more time for good measure: stay calm. Yeah, you have a billion things on your plate. You do. You won't get the admiration and praise you deserve. You won't get people marveling at your skills. But when something goes wrong, they'll still look to you. Take a breath, take a step back, and deal. You got this.
At rehearsals, always set the tone for a calm and professional atmosphere. Play quiet music, keep loud talk to a minimum and, if possible, work to give the director a few moments alone to gather his thoughts when he walks into the theater. If you begin with a calm atmosphere, you won't have to ask for quiet.

, There's going to be a day when your 100-pound little sister is the only one running stage right. It doesn't take a genius to know that when cue 10 rolls around, she's gonna need help rolling on the Trojan horse. It's things like that (and sometimes much less obvious things) that will crop up that you need to provide a solution for.


And, not to mention, people not getting along and certain people being undependable. Who's good with a saw and who's better at untangling pom poms? Who can't pay attention for five minutes straight and who would you trust with your car? Things like that.
In the event of an emergency or fire alarm you are responsible for the cast and crew and their safety. Review the theatre's policies when it comes to feasible emergency situations.

, That firm but likeable thing? That deserves reiteration, too. You need to keep everyone on task and on time and let them know when they're not pulling their weight, but you also need to cheer on the show and be a voice of positivity. Everyone else is stressing out, too.


It's hell week that's going to need the most positivity from you. You have directors wondering if their show is going to come together and actors that are wondering if they're going to make fools out of themselves or not. Know that and cheer them on. So walk into the theatre with a smile and have a good attitude, regardless of what you actually think!

, Since you are doing a billion trillion things at once, you will make a mistake. You will make several mistakes. Hopefully not the same mistake twice, but multiple mistakes nonetheless. Apologize and move on. Don't sulk or throw a fit. Everyone makes mistakes. It's a tough gig. You'll learn from it. And now it's in the past.


Everyone in the theatre generally has a preconception of how things should work. They all think something a little different. Since there's no use in accommodating them all, do what feels right to you. Take their suggestions if they're better and ignore them if they're not. But to find what feels right to you, you'll need to mess up. That's good! Just remember to pick right back up where you left off. The show depends on it!

Learn your lines word for word.,
Watch good actors, particularly your friends, perform their part.,
Watch the same play you are performing, but by different people.,
Practice in front of the mirror.,
Try your lines out in front of your family.,
Pull it all together.",How to Be Good in School Plays," Focus on the lines. Write them down, as this helps you to remember them. Then, say the lines out loud for as many times as you think is needed to be able to repeat them in your sleep.
, Compare their normal personalities to how they perform in the play. Look at their hand movements, and how they declaim their speeches. This will help you discover the tricks and ways that allow you to change your normal personality into the one in the play, temporarily. Try to learn how they do it, then try it yourself., Observe the person who has your role, and compare it to your performance. Try to improve by correcting little things, such as hand movements or pauses in speeches., Focus on nothing else but your lines and the character's personality. If it is an angry and rude character, say your lines with anger and violence. If it is a sweet character, speak in a soft and gentle voice. Practice until you are tone, posture and delivery perfect.

Research on the Internet about the nature of the character if they were famous. If not, figure it out yourself by learning about the entire play. If the character is brave, then learn how to look brave physically. For example, looking right into the eye while talking, firm posture, holding your chin up and so on.

, Pretend that they are the audience. Ask their opinion on how they thought you performed, and also ask for advice and small tips. Add these tips to your act., Finally, on the big day, calm down, do not think of your lines, and perform with all your heart. Do not think of anything like humiliation; instead, just focus on the task to be done and treat it like any other activity that must be done well. Act as though the audience isn't there, and act as though you are at home, in front of a mirror. Remember, you are the only person who can judge yourself."
"
Know what acting is!,
Know your character!,
Learn your lines!,
Know the blocking.,
Be confident!,
Get the timing right.,
Understand the Fourth Wall.,
If you desperately need to, improvise!,
Respect everyone involved.,
Performance Day!!",How to Be a Great Actor in Middle School," Acting, despite the term, is not simply acting like someone else... it is practically being someone else!;
, You need to know your character up and down. You must know him/her/it better than you know your best friend: his traits, his habits, how old he is, his hopes and dreams and fears, his past, even the way he walks. A nosy woman could walk like a bird and constantly raise her eyebrows. A grouchy old man could have a limp and the saddest facial expression. If the details aren't specified by your director, make it up. Bring the character to life!

, KNOW THEM! If you don't have your lines memorized, you're sunk! A performance is powerful and smooth if you know what you are supposed to say. I admit, it can be difficult. To help with memorization, you can write down your lines several times. You can practice with friends and family. Practice in front of the mirror, with feeling! Practice does make perfect!

, Blocking is where you are supposed to move and what you are doing with your body. A well-placed gesture can make a dull line interesting. But be careful not to mime everything you're saying.

, Your comfort zone is irrelevant. Be must LOUD, get out there! Do not be afraid to make a fool of yourself. When people laugh at you during a performance, you are entertaining them! (This may not be a good sign during a sad, dramatic play though...) Looking and sounding like a total idiot makes for great comedy.

, Do not just plow through your lines as soon as the other person finishes! For example, if your co-star says, ""Look, a fire-breathing dragon!"", jump and frantically look around before you speak.

, The fourth wall is the imaginary wall between the audience and the actors. Unless you are specifically told to interact with the audience, DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BEHIND THAT WALL. Never ever ever break character. Never giggle when you aren't supposed to. Don't let it be known to the audience that you forgot your line.

, If you forgot your lines, think of what your character would say in their situation and say it! (This is difficult in a rhyming script.) Always help out your co-stars, too. For example, if he was supposed to say, ""Wow, she is beautiful..."", you can cover for him by saying, ""I bet you think she's beautiful. Your eyes are popping out of your head."" Improvising is difficult, which is why you need to know your lines.

, Be respectful to the cast, the directors, and most especially the undervalued crew. Even if you aren't on the best terms with the cast members, put that aside so you can have a wonderful performance! The crew (lights, sound, props and costume workers) is often treated unfairly by the cast because they didn't get a role. Do not tease them. They are important. Keep in mind that your performance would be nothing without them.

, You have done everything to prepare. You know your lines and your blocking. The cast and crew is well-rested and ready to go. Your play is darn near perfect! (Maybe not, but always give it your best try.) Relax, go through your lines, and fight back those butterflies! It's really fun to do a warm-up with the whole cast. Break a leg!

That will help you develop your characters more.;
, This will help to keep you on track. Remember that a typical play is right around 60 pages and mostly all dialogue. Don't concern yourself with thoughts too much, your entire story must be told through your characters' discussion.

, So, sit with family, friends or both and do a read through. You can gain valuable feedback on what is understood and what is missed. Take that feedback and use it.

, If you don't, think about attending a local open mic night. Take a scene or a good long monologue and perform it. Take business cards with you and hand them out. You can scope out local talent and get an idea of any people who would be good as certain characters. If you have a group of friends that can act, assemble a cast yourself and perform your play. There are usually exhibitions/contests where new artists and writers are featured.

, If you hear back from the casting team with a congratulatory statement proclaiming you to be a semifinalist, you will need to fill out a second round of release forms and informational forms before you can officially accept the semifinalist nomination and prepare for the show.


This second round of forms is often due a month or two after your phone interview takes place.

, If you are accepted to the show, one of the best things you can do to prepare yourself is to watch past episodes and take notes.


Study successful entrepreneurs to determine why their pitches earned them a deal. Also study entrepreneurs who failed to get a deal to determine at which point their pitch got messed up.






Carefully watch the reactions and remarks of each “shark.” Doing so will help you to understand how they respond to different ideas and approaches.

, You will be put into contact with one of the show's producers, but you should also seek advice from professionals you know and trust in your own experiences.


Live-stream and film rehearsal pitches with the producer assigned to you. This producer will be able to offer you practical advice from the perspective of someone intimately familiar with the show.
Ask for advice from business associates, contacts, and others within your network for additional opinions, as well.







, Once you fine-tune your pitch, practice making it as often as possible.


You will likely have a few months to practice. Practice in front of your business associates, friends, family, and even in front of the mirror. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will be with what you need to say when the time comes for you to film.

Set your budget.,
Know what you want.,
Know what to expect.,
Check for casting calls.,
Contact the show.,
Show some enthusiasm.,
Watch out for special opportunities.Sometimes, Property Brothers will put out a casting call for those who are only interested in updating their current home rather than those who are looking to buy.,
Wait to be contacted.,
Understand your commitment.,
Work with the Scott brothers.,
Reapply, if necessary.",How to Get on Property Brothers," You will be responsible for the entire cost of the project. Before you proceed, you need to know how much money you can afford to spend and have the financing in place.

You can have the money yourself or you can gain access to the funding through bank loans, but either way, you will need to have enough money to set aside for buying and fixing a home.
Determine an overall budget and let the Scott brothers guide you from there. For instance, if you can afford to spend $75,000 total, prepare this basic figure without worrying how much to set aside for buying the house and how much to set aside for renovating it. The show's hosts will be able to help you with those figures.
Budgets usually range anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000.The Scott brothers usually finish on budget, but they have been known to go several thousand dollars over budget on rare occasions.

, Determine what you hope to find when searching for a new home. Classify which features are “must-haves” and which features you can afford to compromise on.

Make a list of important features, including everything from location to individual room size. The more you know about what your ideal home would look like, the closer you can get to achieving it.
Some features, like a certain amount of yard space or a decent school system, cannot be easily changed even if you renovate. Mark these down and determine which ones are features that you cannot budge on and which you would be willing to give up if necessary. Knowing which features you must have will help the Scott brothers find the right home for you if you are selected for the show.
Go through your remaining list and look at all the features that can be changed through renovations. Mark down which of these features you must have and which you can sacrifice if you do not have enough money. Knowing which of these features are absolute necessaries will help the Scott brothers figure out what to focus on as they plan their renovations, should you be selected.

, Prepare yourself for what the Scott brothers might require of you.

You will probably need to help with the renovations, especially if you have a fairly small budget. Expect to knock down walls and to work within the show's time frame.
Familiarize yourself with the show before applying. Study episodes of the show, including each couple's background story and how much participating couples are expected to help with. Understanding the background story will help you to tailor your application so that you stand out to the show's producers. Knowing how much work you will be expected to contribute will keep you from being thrown off guard if you are selected.

, You can check the show's social media pages for the latest news concerning the acceptance of applications.

The Property Brothers Facebook page is the best place to check for current news about casting.Check under the ""About"" section of the page for information about whether or not the show is currently accepting applications.
Take note of the geographic area currently eligible. Casting is almost always restricted to a certain area. Since the show is based in Canada, casting is most often open to residents of Vancouver or other regions of Canada. Occasionally, though, the show does open up opportunities for residents in the United States.
The show also has a Twitter feed that you can monitor for similar updates.Residents of the United States can also monitor current Property Brothers opportunities by checking the HGTV ""Be On HGTV"" page., E-mail the show's producers with as much information concerning your situation as possible.

Submissions should be sent to: propertybrothers@cineflix.com
Include your name and basic contact information, including phone number, e-mail address, and current home address.
Describe your current situation and why you want to be on the show. You might a young couple with a growing family in need of more space, or you could be a retired couple looking to downsize into something more manageable. You need to describe your circumstances to the best of your ability. In other words, plead your case.

, In order to be chosen for the show, you will need to show considerable personality and dedication.

As you describe your situation, you should also be prepared to demonstrate your willingness to participate. The vast majority of people on the show end up helping with the renovations. If you are unable to do so, make sure to have willing friends and family who can help.
Let them know what your budget is. This information is not strictly necessary, but providing it lets the Scott brothers know what to expect and also lets the casting director know that you are serious about making things work.
Consider mailing in a video application.Take footage of your current living space and explain in a voice-over why you need something more. Upload the video online and e-mail the link. A video is a good way to convey excitement and demonstrate your personality.

, These opportunities are rarer, but they might make it possible for you to get help on an even tighter budget than usual.

These applications should be e-mailed to: bvbcasting@gmail.com
Check the eligibility requirements. The show will still restrict applications by geographic location. In addition, there may also be limits on the style of home.
Include complete contact information. This includes your full name, home address, phone number, and e-mail address.
Provide information about your situation. You should include a short description about your family's living situation, needs, and desires. You should also describe what property enhancement ideas you have.
Attach photographs. You should include a recent picture of everyone living in the home, two or three pictures of every room in the house, at least one picture of the front of the house, and at least one picture of the back of your house.

, If you are chosen for the show, the producers will contact you.

Oftentimes, you will hear back from the show within a week if they are interested.On occasion, though, it could take a couple of months before you get a reply. Response time mostly depends on the number of applicants.
You may not receive a rejection e-mail if you are not chosen for the show. If you have not received a reply by the time the application process closes, your home has not been selected.

, You will likely be asked to sign a contract before appearing on the show.

You are completely responsible for the cost of buying your home and renovating it. You will not need to pay the Scott brothers, however, nor will you need to contribute to their travel expenses.
A large portion of the initial responsibility for finding the home will also fall to you. The producers may ask that you find a real estate agent in your area who can find fixer-up homes in decent neighborhoods, especially if you live outside of the show's usual filming area.
You will need to be prepared to work on the show's schedule. This means being able to move out of your current home and into your new home within a few months. For instance, if you are selected for the show by late September, you can expect to be filming by late December.

, Drew Scott is responsible for helping you to find your new home, while Jonathan Scott is responsible for the bulk of the renovations.

Drew Scott will work with you and your real estate agent to determine a particular house will make sense financially. He will also help you to negotiate the listing price by performing a thorough inspection of the home.
Jonathan Scott will use CGI to show you what your prospective house can look like after renovations. He is responsible for the overall design and will work with you in determining the most cost efficient options.
Provide input. The two brothers will work with you; they will not make decisions against your will unless you do not make your will known.
Prepare to do a lot of physical work. For the most part, homeowners are expected to help with some of the demolition.
The show may or may not contribute some funding toward the cost of furnishing, depending on your circumstances and the renovations planned out. Property Brothers has been known to provide $20,000 to $25,000 toward furnishings.
Renovations are usually finished within four to six weeks.

, If you were not chosen for the show during the application round you took part in, you can try again.

Consider why your previous application may not have been successful before reapplying. Objectively review your application and look for ways to seem more dedicated, to make your plea sound more urgent, or to add more excitement or creativity to your application.

Look the Part: One of the best things about being a theatre kid is that you can look the way you want.,
Sing everywhere you go!,
Find your Dedication to the arts: The core group of theatre kids are those who have found their passion in the art and are tirelessly devoting themselves to it.,
Be willing to try to fail...and try to fail again: Theatre, as an art, is difficult.,
Don't Judge Others: Theatre kids often feel judged by other groups, so don't turn around and do it too.,
""'Talk about what you're doing!""'",How to Be a Theatre Kid," Theatre kids are known for being themselves and not caring about the judgment of others.


While that is certainly not true of everyone, acceptance of themselves is a goal that theatre kids work towards. You can be any height, weight, do your hair however you’d like- diversity is key. Because theatre kids strive to be themselves, they do not feel pressured to wear designer clothes or popular mall labels. It is the art that matters, so when it comes to clothes they are like any other kids. While preppy certainly isn’t the norm, you won’t be judged if you dress like it as long as you don’t have the stereotypical prep attitude that many attribute to that style.
Comfort, in a presentable and laid back way, is key because much of the time you will be in rehearsal or in a class perfecting your craft. T shirts, jeans, converse, dance pants, flats- things like this. It’s not to say theatre girls don’t love heels, they do, but it’s just not convenient for rehearsal. Outside of the theater though, they are just like every other kid.
Also, it is unappreciated by true theatre kids when others try to be accepted into the group just because they dress in a stereotypical manner. Theatre kids don’t all wear cartoon or comic tees or shirts with “witty” sayings, in fact, few do. These ideas only came about because the negative stereotype is “weird.” Also, you will not be accepted as a theatre kid just because you wear the shirt from your favorite musical. They don’t care how much you like “Wicked,” it is the dedication they want to see.;
, Well, not literally. But hey, if you feel like it, do it. Like I said in the step above, theatre kids work at being themselves. If you feel like being a bit crazy, be crazy, and if you feel like sitting by yourself with your iPod or reading a book- you can do that too. As far as literally singing, theatre kids do that =) Feel free, be loud, sound pretty, sound awful; it’s great stress relief. While it’s true that many theatre kids do love musicals and classic music like the Beatles, everyone is different. So while you may find some who shun the mainstream radio, you’ll find just as many who love it and many in-between. Just be prepared that theatre kids love diversity in their music, do not judge their tastes. If you don’t like it, don’t listen.

, It is extremely apparent when you are not committed. Many kids who do theatre, in your school for instance, may have other interests; maybe some terms they do sports after school instead of the play. It's perfectly fine to do that, but the amount you are committed to either activity is what will distinguish you as a ""theatre kid"" or as a really good friend"" of the theatre kids.

, For many, it does not come easily and it takes many failures to find a success. You need to learn to see the value in small successes so you don't feel discouraged because rejection will happen. You need to have a sense of ""This is what I love and I will not give up."" Many theatre kids struggle with self worth because it is such a demanding and competitive activity. Just do your best, be happy, and you will find friends and things to be proud of.

, It's hypocritical. Just because someone does sports and not theatre does not make them a bad person or unworthy of your time. Accept other's passion as you wish they would accept yours.

, If you're in a show, talk about it! Don't be shy!

Create a core idea for a show, and be sure it has original elements.,
Know which sub-genre of reality programming your idea falls into.,
Be specific in your concept, and try several approaches.,
Choose concepts and subjects that are highly marketable- Titles are very important, they should roll off the tongue easily, provoke conversations, and simply tell you exactly what you’re going to be watching.,
Think of movies- ""Story"" is a critical element to define when developing a reality-based project.,
Develop and write your concept- A treatment for a reality show can be anywhere from 1 to 3 pages, sometimes more.,
Protect your reality show idea by registering it with The Writer's Guild of America (east coast) or (west coast) for third party proof-of-creation.

,
Research the various production companies producing reality-based television programs and find a likely match for the type of project you have created.

,
Make cold calls to development executives at each company to know if they will accept your pitch.

,
Consider an online industry database to pitch your projects for pitching your new reality show idea for review and purchase by leading Production Companies scouting new projects, including CBS, Fox TV Studios, ABC, ITV, BBC, and others.,
If offered an option deal by a production company, you will be able to negotiate a producing credit and financial participation.,
If the production company engages you for the production and distribution of your show concept, you will be engaged with some form of Producer credit and fees per episode.

,
The Production company will be responsible to delivering the show to the network for airing.",How to Create a Reality Show," Though it may be similar to other formats already, you must have elements and methods that area clearly original so that the content created is something unique and exciting to watch.

, There are many genres for reality shows, including: Competition/Elimination, Docu-Style Series, Lifestyle Series, Relationship Series, and countless others.

, Many producers will create original concepts with their development team, but most often producers scout aggressively for new concepts and reality show ideas from writers and concept creators. So don’t be afraid to work on several show concepts at once. It takes a lot of projects, but only takes one to connect with the right producer.

, “Blind Date”, “Temptation Island”, “The Bachelor”, “Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire” are all good examples. Word play is always a good way to grab attention and create curiosity. “Meet the Parents” “Eliminate” “Joe Millionaire” “The Real World” “Around the World in Eighty Dates” are all specific to what their show is about, but use known phrases to create new titles that pique curiosity.

, When you look at movies, look at the core concept and story elements of the film, and a reality show just might be staring you smack in the face. “Cannonball Run”, “Meet the Parents”, “Around the World in Eighty Dates” are all specific examples of film concepts that have translated into reality-based shows for television.

, The key is efficiency in describing the elements and action involved, but also creating enough detail to be original. Research industry sources about creating reality show concepts to pitch.

,,,, The TV Writers Vault also provides electronic proof-of-review for your record and protection.

, Always use an experienced entertainment attorney for assistance in negotiating any deal.

,, If you have experience in development or production for television, then you may negotiate a more direct involvement in the show once it reaches network and production.

Look for the eyes.",How to Find Bloody GIR,", He's been registered as being in Mortos Der Soulstealer, Bad Bad Rubber Piggies, Plague of Babies, Tak: The Hideous New Girl, Backseat Drivers From Beyond the Stars and The Fry cook What Came from All That Space. Nick is showing Invader Zim for this March only.


To find Bad, Bad Rubber Piggies, watch closely as the final pig goes through the Space Time Object Replacement Device when the portal flashes white. You can see a very faint image of Bloody GIR. It is easier if you have a laptop, you can tilt the screen, it is very easy now
To find the Plague of Babies Watch the Voot ship crash sequence. You will notice several instances of Bloody GIR looking into the window at the left side of the screen.
To find Tak: The Hideous New Girl, watch as Tak's ship falls from space. As it crashes, Bloody GIR is faintly visible at the center of the screen. Or, as the meat ship lands, when the door is about to be completely opened, near the back wheels of the ship, a Bloody GIR is seen.
Look for the Backseat Drivers from Beyond the Stars. Watch as the Almighty Tallest discovers the Resisty's Vort ship. A Bloody GIR appears on Purple's head as he says, ""That's a Vort Ship.""
When the Frycook What Came from All That Space, during a flashback of when Zim first started working, a scene is shown when alien customers start spitting their soda at him. When this is going on watch the window, a very familiar ship passes by. When it gets to the left of Zim's head you see Bloody GIR on the ship. You have to go frame by frame or pause very quickly to see this one. After the ship flies by, the customer throws a cup at Zim. When two cups are visible in midair, pause right at that second and very very faintly visible over the cups will be Bloody GIR.

In Dark Harvest, when the chase between Zim and Dib starts, you can faintly see one eye of Bloody GIR.
In the The Sad, Sad Tale of Chickenfoot, as the microwave explodes, in the bottom-right corner, Bloody GIR is spotted. The background is red, so it might not be as easy to spot in the background as other ones.

Ask, “What type of pornography would you want to watch?” Also ask, “What type of pornography would make you uncomfortable?”
Never force your significant other to watch something that makes them uncomfortable.
Don’t interrogate your significant other, and don’t be angry if they are not interested in watching pornography.;
, Nighttime is often ideal since there is less of a chance your friends will visit or you will receive a call. If you share a room, only watch pornography when you know your roommate will not be home. Additionally, choose a time when your partner is not tired or stressed, and always ask them if they are in the mood to watch pornography before playing a video or opening a magazine.


Ask your partner, “Is now a good time to watch pornography?”
Check with family members to see if they are planning on coming home.
Watch pornography in your room if you live with others; do not watch it in the living or family room.

, Adult DVDs and magazines can easily be found at a local adult entertainment store. If you are not sure if there is one located around you, use a search engine to find the nearest one. However, going to a store is not necessary since plenty of pornography is available for free online.

, There are many popular adult entertainment sites that are free, such as Pornhub, xVideos, YouPorn, and so on. One option is to pick a site to visit. You can also type “porn” in a search engine or search for a genre of pornography you would like to watch, such as “lesbian porn.” Each site offers a plethora of pornography for you to choose from.


Whether you want to watch straight, gay, or group pornography, it is all available online.

Turn off the safe search on the search engine you are using; otherwise, the pornography sites may not come up.

, You don’t have to watch a video if it makes you uncomfortable. If you are with your significant other, you can tell them, “I don’t like this video. Let’s watch a different one.” If you are by yourself, simply change the DVD or go to a different website. Watching pornography should be a comfortable experience.

, Just because you are watching pornography doesn’t mean the communication between you and your significant other stops. Check in with your significant other throughout the experience. Make sure they are doing ok, and if they seem uncomfortable, ask if anything is wrong.


It’s ok to laugh and be silly while watching pornography.
Ask your significant other if they like the pornography.
Ask your significant other what they would like to do while watching the video, DVD, or looking at the magazine.

, Some pornographic videos can be over an hour long. You may want to fast forward the DVD or video to find a part you like instead of watching an entire video. Also, if you are watching pornography online, you can watch a few different videos until you find one you feel like watching.

, If you are new to this experiment, see what feels good. Remember there is no pressure to perform or reach orgasm, so feel free to explore.

Identify the characters.,
Watch as each show opens up with an activity.,
Learn Mandarin Chinese throughout the episode.,
Identify ""cause and effect"" problems.,
Admire Kai-lan as she gives appreciation to not only her friends, but also the viewers as well at the end.",How to Enjoy Ni Hao Kai Lan,"


Kai-lan: Often referred to as the ""Chinese Dora"", she brings the viewers into the daily activities that her and her friends do. She always tries to see the positive aspect of situations.






Yeye: Kai-lan's grandfather. He inspires Kai-lan and her friends with advice on how to work out problems.






Hoho: The youngest of Kai-lan's friends. This monkey is filled with energy and loves being in the center of the crowd.






Lulu: Known for having a balloon tied to her nose, this rhino loves to play pretend or tea parties.






Rintoo: Roaring along with Kai-lan in the introduction, this tiger loves race cars and adventure.






Tolee: You can find this panda always thinking of new ideas.





;
, There's many things or events that could happen. For example, a moon festival, sleepovers, or playing at the beach.

, When Kai-lan introduces the activity, she usually asks the viewer, ""Do you want to see how I say _______ in Chinese?"", followed by, ""Say _______."" She'll then repeat it again to encourage the viewer and applaud them.

, Every episode starts off as great and happy, but always comes to a negative point or turn where someone is unhappy, sad, or mad.


For example, in the episode, ""Sports Day"", Rintoo eventually wins all of the races and says phrases like, ""I'm going to win because I'm the best!"" and ""I'm better than everyone!"". These comments makes Tolee and Hoho quit the races and games. Yeye and the others analyze the situation by suggesting that Rintoo should also say something nice and encourage his friends. When this ""cause and effect"" problem solving is applied, a new lesson is learned.







, It creates more of a bond between everyone to learn, solve, and apply problem solving, as well as the Chinese culture and language into anything.

This is always the top priority: create an artifact.,
Choose a time setting for the story to take place in.,
Create a sidekick/lady for Indy.,
This is the most fun part: create your villain.,
Develop a background story for your artifact.,
After you have taken care of the last five steps, you're ready to finally put your story together on paper!",How to Create Your Own Indiana Jones Adventure," BE CREATIVE! You can either choose an artifact which already exists (i.e, King Tut's Tomb, etc.) and give it your own supernatural flavor to make the story interesting, or you can make your own artifact. Again, BE CREATIVE! Choose a spear that was supposedly carved by God himself, a crystal that has power capable of destroying the world- these are some good ideas to start with.;
, Ideally, go from anywhere from the 1920s to the mid-1950s (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). Every reader wants to know what period the story takes place in.

, You CANNOT have an Indiana Jones story without a leading lady and at least one sidekick or ally. Be specific when you are developing these characters: age, looks, characteristics, and where they come from. Do they come from a foreign country or are they from the United States?

, This is another thing you can't have an Indiana Jones story without. Much like creating an artifact, you have to use your imagination! Is the villain male or female? How old are they? Where do they come from? Are there any supporting villains accompanying the main villain? These are all factors to consider when creating your bad- villain. Also, make sure that in some part of the story, they commit something to make you feel like you've created the greatest villain of all time: threatening the leading lady, threatening Indy himself, or you could even have one of the characters get shot or seriously wounded. Whether they die or not is entirely up to you.

, Readers tend to understand an Indiana Jones adventure better if they know where the artifact came from, how it was made, its powers, and what happens when its power is unleashed. This is something to keep in mind at the end of the story, since that's when the artifact's power is revealed in a typical Indiana Jones story.

, When you consider these five steps, you will find putting the story on paper will be easier than you think. All you have to do is create put these elements all together, and you'll have an Indiana Jones story in no time!

Examine the infomercial.,
Decide whether or not it's realistic.,
Get opinions.,
Find out all that they offer.,
What's the price?,
What's the value?,
Decide whether it's worth it.,
Call the number.,
Wait.,
Inspect the item.,
Help others.",How to Decide Whether or Not an Infomercial Is a Scam," If anything looks digitally added, you know that the product may be a potential scam. Many times commercials have to enlarge the item so you can see it, but only if it says, ""Picture enlarged to show detail,"" across the bottom. Google the picture to be sure.

, All products will have some faults. But when they tell you it's waterproof, fireproof, unbreakable, never needs to be charged, foolproof, takes less than a minute to set up, and is also portable, it is almost impossible to be so perfect. You should also check for mistakes such as, ""This item is too big to take along, but call in the next half hour to get a free portable version!"" and a couple minutes later, ""Wow, amazing! This article is even portable!"" Make sure to always check realism.

, Remember that although they tell you ""everything to know"" and offer you a 30 day money back guarantee, obviously they are probably making this all up. Remember the product name and Google it. Look at all reviews and decide for yourself. Some may like it, some may not, it depends on how they use it, or how it's shipped to the person, so go by the majority of people's opinions. Also, if you would like, find out the company that manufactures your product and Google them for information.

, But wait, there's more! That's a extremely common quote in infomercials. They tell you if you call in the next 10 minutes you'll get something else free, just pay processing and handling. But what if you don't want the item? It's a scam because it will be shown in every airing of the infomercial, so it doesn't matter when you call, because basically, that ""extra"" is really just apart of the deal.

, The most common price is $19.99, but they may say ""Just 7 easy payments of (ex.)$13.99!"" First of all, the payments are not easy. They are cleaning out your wallet. But secondly, this causes more work for you to figure out how much the product is worth.

, Many infomercials, even ones for such small and maybe even useless items, will tell you it's worth a larger sum of money and they reduced it for you. That's another lie. You actually end up paying about that price because they make you pay processing and handling for the main item, the ""extra"", and for the product. Sometimes companies will even keep billing your credit card falsely. If you find out they're doing so, immediately report the company!, Usually after all these judgements, you will realize the product isn't worth it. To judge it decide that 0-1 mistakes means a really good item, 2-3 is a good item, 4-5 means an okay items, and 6 mistakes means it's a terrible item.

, Your item made it further ahead, but now is the harder part. You may deal with rude operators or kind operators, but it just depends on the company. Slowly explain your answers to their questions. Never answer any personal questions such as social security numbers, because they're most likely frauds. If this happens, say loudly but slow so they can understand you, ""I will not tell you this, and I am going to cancel my order. If you still send me the (item name), I will report your company."" but if not, answer any questions they may ask.;
, It may take quite a while for your item to arrive. Just wait. If it takes several months, you may want to call the company to ask why.

, If it's damaged, looks as if opened, or is just useless, call the company. If they won't accept it, and you still have your trial pending, you have a right to report them or insist it be sent back.

, Go on review websites, and help any others who may buy the item. No matter you love or hate the item, others want to know your opinion!

Focus on the genre.,
Look up lists on the internet.,
Look at the style of drawing the author uses.,
Begin with the classics.,
Try the first episode.",How to Decide What Anime to Watch," If you love romance, mystery, or something else entirely, you can find an anime about it! There are many different individual genres of anime, but it is also roughly grouped into four main sections by age and gender (not that you should ever let that should stop you if it sounds like something you'd like to watch!)

Shoujo - intended for girls up to the age of 18
Shounen - intended for boys up to the age of 18
Josei - intended for girls over the age of 18
Seinen - intended for boys over the age of 18;
, Once you've decided on a genre, see if you can find a list of recommendations. You probably won't have exactly the same taste as the person who made the list, but you can get some good ideas about which anime to try out.

, If you're a person who can't watch an anime if the drawings are really bad or not your style, then don't! Drawing styles vary depending on the author, genre and when it was drawn.

, They're well-known for a reason! You can start off with the famous ones like Naruto or Bleach.

, If you didn't really like it, at least watch the next episode to see if it picks up. Animes need second chances too!

To get to the ""Write Nick"" page, simply search for ""Write to Nick"" on your favorite search engine or use the ""Write Nick"" option from the MyNick page on the main Nickelodeon website (www.nick.com).;
, Another way to send your questions and concerns to Nickelodeon is to use the official ""Contact Us"" page for Nick UK. This page is meant for Nick viewers in the United Kingdom, but you should be able to get responses for almost all general Nick questions, so don't be afraid to try it out!


To get to the ""Contact Us"" page, search for ""Nick Contact Us"" in your favorite search engine or click the ""Contact Us"" button at the bottom of the UK Nickelodeon website (http://www.nick.co.uk).To find this page, visit the main Nickelodeon website

, If you want to ask Nickelodeon a common question, there's a good chance that someone else has already asked it!

To get to the Help page, click the ""Help"" button at the bottom of the main UK Nickelodeon website (http://www.nick.co.uk)., If you're a journalist or a member of the press contacting Nickelodeon for serious reasons, instead of using Nick's ordinary online contact resources, use an official press or PR contact. These contacts will ensure your question or concern is addressed by a Nick representative in a timely manner — if you use one of the online forms above, it may take time for your serious inquiry to be filtered from thousands of unimportant ones.


There are many official Nickelodeon press contacts — too many, in fact, to list here. For a complete list, visit the press page for the Nickelodeon section of Viacom's website.

, For serious matters like legal issues, business inquiries, and so on, it's usually best to contact Viacom, Nickelodeon's parent company, which has direct control over Nickelodeon's business operations. There are several ways to do this online, which are described below:

Use 1-212-846-2543 for the corporate offices in New York.,
Use regional offices' numbers for local concerns.,
Use press contacts' numbers for press inquiries.",How to Contact Nickelodeon2," Calling Nickelodeon directly isn't a matter of using one single telephone number — the network has regional offices all over the world, each with its own number. However, Nickelodeon's corporate headquarters are in New York City, so the number for this office is suitable for a wide variety of global questions and concerns.


If you're calling from outside the United States, don't forget to add your country's exit code before dialing the phone number.For instance, people in Australia should dial ""0011"" before proceeding ""1-212...""

, As noted above, Nickelodeon has a number of smaller regional offices besides its New York headquarters. These may be more suitable for local questions and concerns than the New York headquarters, so you may want to use these numbers instead, especially if you live near one of these offices. Three of Nickelodeon's most important regional offices' numbers are listed below:


Florida: 1-407-363-8500
California: 1-818-736-3000
London: 1-732-779-8353

, If you're a journalist or a member of the press, rather than calling Nickelodeon's offices, use the company's press and PR contacts. These professionals' jobs are to help ensure that your question or concern is answered as quickly as possible, so they're usually a much better choice for fact-checking questions, company information, and so on than any single office.


As noted above, Nickelodeon has too many press contacts to list here. For a complete list of phone numbers, use the same Press page as referenced above for online press inquiries.

"
Use the New York corporate office's address.,
Use the Burbank studios' address.,
Use regional offices' addresses all over the world.",How to Contact Nickelodeon3," As with contacting Nickelodeon via phone, there is no single address for mailing Nickelodeon — every office around the world has a different physical address, making matters a little complicated. Once again, however, the New York Nickelodeon Headquarters is a great place to start for general inquiries. The NYC office is located at:


New York Office



1515 Broadway, 44th Floor
New York, NY 10036





, Nickelodeon's cartoons aren't written, shot, or animated at the corporate offices in New York. In fact, most of the work that goes into making a great Nick show happens at Nickelodeon Studios in California. For this reason, if you have specific questions about how shows are developed and produced for the network, it's a smart idea to send your mail here. Nickelodeon Studios are located at:


Nickelodeon Studios



231 W Olive Ave
Burbank, CA 91502





, As noted above, Nickelodeon has multiple regional offices throughout the world. Viacom, its parent company, has even more offices. Contacting any of these offices by mail is a viable option for having your inquiries answered, though it's worth noting that each regional office may not be able to answer questions that have to do with things outside its regional ""jurisdiction"".

Practice the steps without music.",How to Dance a Basic Step in Salsa," All music has a beat or basic rhythm to it that can be counted. Music has a certain number of beats per measure, which is usually 3,4 or 6 beats. In salsa music there are 4 beats per measure. The basic salsa dance step uses 2 measures of music, or 8 beats.Try clapping the rhythm of the music while counting 1-8.
Beginners should use salsa music that has a slower beat and an accented percussion. This will help you hear the beat in the music.
Some good starter songs are ""Slow Salsa"" by Jimmy Bosch, ""Cuera Maraca y Bongo"" by Los Nemus, ""Cosas Nativas"" by Frankie Ruiz, or ""Yamulemau"" by Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz.;
, The basic salsa step uses 8 beats to complete, however you don’t step on all 8 beats. Your feet move on beats 1,2,3 with a pause on beat 4; you step again on beats 5,6,7 and pause on beat 8.


Clap when you will be stepping, and don’t clap when you don’t step to understand the rhythm of the dance step.
The rhythm will be clap-clap-clap-pause-clap-clap-clap-pause. Repeat this rhythm throughout an entire song.

, Try standing and marching your feet in place using the salsa rhythm you just clapped. Step your feet down on beats 1, 2, and 3, pausing on beat 4, and repeat the sequence for beats 5 through 8.

, Place numbered cards or sheet of paper on the floor to indicate where to place your feet while you dance.


Number 1 is your starting position, place it in the middle of the room.
Number 2 should be placed about 1 foot in front of number 1.
Number 3 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 1.
Number 4 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 3.

, When you are ready to begin the salsa dance you will step to the next number.

, You will alternate which foot you step with for each beat., Shift your weight from front to back to shift your body position. Swing your hips slightly to accentuate the movement.

, Keep your weight on the ball of your foot when you step backwards. You will stay in this position during beat 4.

, Do not move your feet during beat 4.

, Keep your left foot in place during step 5.

, Swing your hips as you shift your body weight to help add style to your salsa dance.

, Keep your weight on the ball of your foot as you step your right foot forward.

, Do not pick up your feet during step 8. This is the last count of the basic salsa step.


Repeat counts 1-8 again to continue the dance.

, Count the numbers of the beat and move your feet slowly to master the movement.


Add music once you are confident in the footwork.

Be on your best behaviour utilising all of your manners, always.,
Do not volunteer to be a project manager early on.,
Make sure to tackle any task your project manager gives to you with as much enthusiasm and creativity as you can.,
Make sure to gather information on how your team members are doing during the tasks, especially if they are not working well.,
If your team loses, make sure to have in mind who you think should be fired before you get into the boardroom.,
Be humble and have humility.",How to Become the Apprentice," Make it professional, but not boring. It should be creative and it should showcase your talents and some unique (yet professional) things about you. Have several of your friends or family members watch it and offer you feedback for improvement. Remember this will be seen by Donald Trump, so you want it to be fantastic!;
,,, You don't want them to think you are too stuck up to appreciate this opportunity, yet you don't want them to think you are an airhead.

, Don't get wacky colors or patterns. Also, you want to make sure to have clothes for any task that might come up, so pack a wide variety of items. Make sure you have lots of suits, a few polo shirts, some khaki pants, jeans, a bathing suit, whatever you sleep in, and appropriate shoes for all outfits, at a minimum. You must have enough clothing! It won't impress Donald Trump if you show up in the boardroom wearing the same suit every time.

, Always Donald Trump as ""Mr. Trump"" and be respectful. That being said, have a personality and don't let yourself be treated like a doormat. If a teammate is accusing you of something, rebut and somehow deflect the blame on someone else. Don't call them a liar, stupid, etc, but do defend yourself. Often times, people are fired because they couldn't deflect the blame from themselves. Honesty is a treasured trait too. If you made a mistake, admit it but don't take more blame than you should be and share how you tried to fix it.

, You will not get too much glory, and you will get all of the blame. Hold off on being project manager until there are less than 10 other competitors. Once you volunteer, work hard and win!

, This way, if your team does not win, you can tell them you did the job you were assigned to do and you can focus the blame on the other people who were not as good as you. Project managers do not usually blame the team members who followed their direction because it makes them look bad. That being said, use common sense. If you are trying to sell something in a mall in a primarily Hispanic city, it is obvious that you may need a translator unless you or a team member can speak fluent Spanish. If the project manager tells you not to get one, getting a translator anyway may just save you in the boardroom.

, This will give you ammunition to use in the boardroom, if your team happens to lose.

, The reason most people get fired is because they do not deflect the blame off of themselves well enough. If your team members start picking on someone else, jump on board, that way no one will pick on you.

, Don't brag if you're team just kicked butt in the challenge, and don't mope if you lost. It is also not advisable to get into any romantic relationships with a person on set, teammate or otherwise. Everything is caught on camera, and it won't look too good to Mr Trump or your significant other back home.

Describe its spin-off shows.",How to Become a Fan of the Wild and Crazy Kids TV Game Show," Every episode featured a teaser tie-in before the introductory ""credits."" This was followed by an introductory spiel that most fans will remember.The audio track never really changed, with the exception of the host names, when the host changed. It generally ran a little something like this: 'Welcome to Wild & Crazy Kids, the show that goes anywhere and does anything to find kids having fun, with your hosts, Annette Chavez/Jessica Gaynes, Omar Gooding, (and) Donnie Jeffcoat."" If there was a guest star on the show, they'd include the snippet ""and our special guest star (name), at the very end of the spiel.You could hear a robotic backup group singing a melodic loop of ""Wild and Crazy, Wild and Crazy, Wild and Crazy,"" until the end when they sung a long and drawn-out ""Kids"".
During season 1, Omar and Annette narrated these spiels interchangeably. During season 2, Jessica narrated, and by season 3, it was both Donnie and Jessica. However, fans could tell that Jessica did so more often than Donnie during season 3.


The video track changed from year to year, mostly with new scenes of kids having fun from that season's games.Then, on the graffiti-style logo, each letter flickered on and off on the screen. In season 1, each letter from the title flickered on and off until the word ""Kids"" displayed on its own, in full, on a separate slide. Each letter was outlined in black and surrounded by a single color of the screen behind it. The Nickelodeon name was never seen on its own slide on the screen during this time. The letters they used were huge and filled the screen from top to bottom, at an angle; they also featured more previews of other games inside of these letters.In subsequent years, the games changed in the narrated intro, and the video track began with the splash screen of the Nickelodeon logo, followed up with the same letters in the filled in screen. This time, each letter expanded until it completely filled the screen from top to bottom. No matter what season you had looked at it, all letters were completely wacky. Also, when Jessica came in, after ""Kids"" displayed but before the logo was revealed at the end, a bunch of exclamation marks inside soap-bubbles were placed overtop of the logo for a short time and were revealed one at a time for a few seconds.;
, This game show had little to no structure, so there was no point structure to determine a team winner in this game. The three (sometimes four) games were played purely for fun, and to spark the audience's excitement and imagination., It didn't have a typical prize structure, but the main goal seems to have been enjoyment of the game itself. While kids gained satisfaction from the idea they could get wild and messy and crazy, parents and teachers appreciated how the game sparked imagination and energy in the kids.

In the closing segment, the teaser trailer to each episode was continued, as the show faded to the credits with a sped-up version of a continuation of the teaser.

, Most of the games on this show weren't played more than once, so there isn't a set structure to become familiar with. However, some of games made big-time news in other programs, including ""Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby"" and even the biggest (record-setting) game of Twister ever played.

In Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby, a Home-Run Derby styled game was played between parents and kids. However, before going up to bat, each adult player had to spin around with their head on top of a baseball bat that was standing on the ground, to make them dizzy. While the kids were thrown the balls by a pitcher (Marc Summers and Scott Bailles), parents had to bat off of a baseball T - not an easy thing to focus on when you are dizzy. Parents were also given a time frame in which to complete the task of hitting the total number of balls allowed, while the kids didn't have that restriction.
This game show set the record for most kids playing the game of Twister, using more than 20 boards attached to one another. These were set up on the National Mall in Washington, DC (from one end to the other).
In another game, they played a massive game of Simon Says, with comedian Brian Seeman as the head caller. Both of these two games were standard rules but involved larger numbers of players.
In another game, a massive game of tug of war was played with a team of wrestlers versus a team of kids. There were other games, too, such as Three-Legged Races: Soccer Style and even a game of Donkey Basketball.In one episode, they used the Colossus roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain (at the time) to film a game where kids held a cup of colored water to see which team had more water in their cup by the end - you'd be surprised at who completed this the best (sorry, no spoilers here!).In yet other games, slip and slides were used, along with games that featured kids dunking their parents and educators in dunk tanks.Still other games involved a bunch of teams playing challenges inside an empty mall. The games there included chugging a stein-worth of root beer, drilling a basketball in a hallway, racing other teams on a Nintendo Powerpad, pumping up pump-shoes (similar to Nike Pumps), taking part in a pie-eating contest, dealing with having a scare boarding contest, and putting on surfer outfits.In yet another episode, there was a massive pillow fight, while the player had an egg secured to their body and had to make it through a course in order to protect the egg.
Another popular game featured kids driving remote-controlled cars in an arena where a steamroller was also driving around. The car couldn't be ran over by the steamroller or the team would be eliminated. The car that remained was the winner. In a variant of the game, a few cars were placed on the board and the first player to have it run over by the steamroller won. Other variants include having the cars on a sand dune gauntlet area; while some players were moving the cars, other players were hacking them with mallets in order to destroy the cars. The best car that survived the beating won the game.

, No one game ever was played the same, so there really was no one ""set"" here. The producers had to keep changing things and making things different for each item they played. Although they had soundstage rights at Nickelodeon, they used alternate locations around the country for filming, including theme parks., This differed by the event and by how many teams were playing. Sometimes it would be between blue and red, but they also had other colors choose from, including green (lime green), yellow (sun-bleached yellow) and many others including pink, purple, black, orange, grey, lavender, peach, aqua (they called blue) and many others. Each color differed by season., Safety measures were taken for every game, so equipment varied a little. However, players would always wear their team-colored t-shirt with their show logo on it. Each shirt was embossed with the complete Wild and Crazy Kids logo, without the Nickelodeon logo nor the logo's traditional colors; the shirts were embossed in pure black ink and filled in by the shirt color. Contestants wore sneakers, and often had eye protection and knee protection., The show's classic full Iogo contained two parts - the traditional Nickelodeon splash banner on top of the Wild&Crazy (with no spaces) Kids (line 3) title. All the letters were in all capitals, apart from ""k"" and ""i"" (which were lower case but full-sized). Both the Wild & Crazy Kids words looked like graffiti. The & symbol was formed as a backwards E with two tinier lines above and below the E. The second line (Wild & Crazy) words were off-pink, and were filled with a texture like soap bubbles, in darker pink, about a quarter of the way from the bottom. The word ""kids"" was painted green, and also had the soap bubble effect, about half-way into each of the letters, in a much darker hue of green. Each letter had a thick black outline, which connected the letters of ""Wild & Crazy"" to each other and to the letters of ""Kids"". On some of the later episodes, the black faded into the white border and made it look like the white was the only border used to form these letters. On the back of the shirt, there was a cloud-like graphic with an exclamation mark symbol inside of it.



 


Before the last season, a much simpler approach was used. There was no Nickelodeon banner, and the lettering was rainbow colored from top to bottom. Even the soap bubble backings got dropped, and in place, there was a squiggle paint of greenish color just randomly painted ""underneath"" the title.Players would also be required to wear Sketchers sneakers, as part of a promotional deal with Nickelodeon. Kids had to wear these sneakers that were provided, in exchange for playing the games.

, This show used a few hosts. Two of the three hosts stayed for all of the years this show aired, but one didn't stay past the first year. During the first season, Annette Chavez starred, along with two others, Omar Gooding and Donnie Jeffcoat. Wild and Crazy Kids was the first and only TV game show Annette would do, but she has since taken other acting jobs for TV roles on major sitcoms such as E.R. and General Hospital.Replacing Annette for the second and third season was Jessica Gaynes, who, much like Annette, went onto other roles (such as Jawbreaker and the film-adaption of Chicken Soup for the Soul ). Omar Gooding, who starred in all seasons of this show, went on to other non-game-show roles, including parts in Hangin' with Mr. Cooper and Cousin Skeeter.Donnie Jeffcoat later acted in General Hospital, but he first got his big break (even before Wild and Crazy Kids) was as Eric on the Wonder Years., During the third season, Wild and Crazy Kids brought along special guest stars who hosted and interacted with the teams and even played in some of the games. These included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lark Voorhies, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Michael Fishman, and others. Marc Summers came on board to help pitch in an episode when there was Dizzy Bat Home Run Derby: The Sequel"". Others included Scott Bailes and Bruce Hurst, Rodney Pete, Michael Bower/Venus DeMilo/Danny Cooksey, Bode Miller, Brandon Call, and Tobey Maguire., Wild and Crazy Kids aired on Nickelodeon for three straight seasons, for a total of 75 episodes between July 4, 1990 and December 1, 1992. Although its time slot on weekends differed, it was fit into a thirty minute time slot (with the actual program being 22 minutes)., The pilot used a much simpler logo that included a hand-signed ""Wild and Crazy"" line and the word ""Kids"" in boxes. There was also a left-over triangle on a nighttime starry background. This single episode, which debuted in 1989, had lesser-known hosts, Matt Brown, Leslie Hibbard and Cory Tyler.

The introduction was simpler: Welcome to Wild & Crazy Kids, with your hosts, Matt Brown, Leslie Hibbard and Cory Tyler. The pilot was shown on TV to the public, but few people actually remember this specific episode. It had games such as Horses vs Bikes Race, Student-Teacher Maze Race, and Kung Fu Smash House.Due to copyright restrictions, the pilot episode is not available on YouTube.

, After loosing some of the audience for a potential 1993 season, Wild and Crazy Kids was revived in 2002. It had only 10 episodes between July 29, 2002 and October 7, 2002 , but it featured some significant guest stars. Daryl Sabra and Alexa Vega were on the show, as well as Nick Cannon and Aaron Carter. It was hosted by Mati Moralejo and although the game outline didn't change much, its graphics did.

The classic Nickelodeon logo appeared inside of an orange right-pointing arrow, along with the new logo inside of a circle, with other red, blue, and green colored arrows pointing in every which direction possible. The circle was outlined in purple and the text no longer looked like graffiti; the letters were in the correct case for a title - with some letters inside of the circle bigger than others.Players had a new shirt design, and games weren't just played solely by kids now - parents joined in on the team-mate fun with their kids.
The introduction was shortened to, ""It's Wild & Crazy Kids! I'm Mati Moralejo with David Aizer and Vivianne Collins!"" Then they'd describe what would be happening in that particular episode. The teaser trailer was dropped, and the game started right from the roll of the credits. The game was less popular than the original, and didn't last very long, so it has fewer fans.

Generally, the narrator would begin ""You're building on a(n) (x-number of letters)-letter word."" Then the narrator would announce the topic after the word began (the clue word would sometimes be a distraction). The visuals would take over as he narrated. The pieces of the puzzle would begin to fill in. Generally, the word would be anywhere from 5-8 letters long, and could be found in any official Scrabble Dictionary.


After the word completely filled in, you could hear the audience burst out the answer that was displayed on the screen in that day's puzzle. Then a common quote is used to introduce the title sequence ""It's the crossword game you've played all your life, but never quite like this."" In the meantime, the visuals would bring Scrabble tiles moving randomly across the board. All of a sudden, the titles would join and you could hear the audience scream ""Scrabble"". Then they'd say, ""And here's your host, Chuck Woolery.""
By 1986, the introductory sequence including introducing the last player to get to the Bonus Sprint from the last show, as well as who'd be vying for a repeat spot in that day's game.
By 1988, on top of having the host talk to the players about themselves, the narrator would help describe in single sentences the name of the player and what they did when they weren't playing on the TV game show.
By 1993, the narration was followed up with on-screen text of what was being said in the narration. Instead of the tile randomly moving around the board, they were placed with better computer animations and graphics.;
, Most episodes never started at the beginning, but with players with one or two puzzles already solved. This information will be described below.

, After a brief visual transition, the camera focused on a board to the left of the host. The board looked like a gigantic Scrabble board set up with tiles. Computer animations would make a pink-bordered ring around the board to introduce the first match. Generally, the first puzzle would begin as a horizontally-placed word with one pre-filled letter, with at least one of these letters starting at the star at the center of the board. The host would say ""Building on an x-numbered lettered word"" and then would give a clue that sometimes would give away what the word would be. Players would pick from several different tiles on the contestant desk. These tiles turned into letters when picked and placed into the tray in front of said player.



Utilizing what letters were graphically put in front of them, letters would slide around the board from one end to the other; if the letter was a valid puzzle letter, the letter would slide into the slot. However, if the letter wasn't a valid piece and wasn't a piece of the crossword, these tiles were called a stopper (these were denoted by the red flashing symbol that was octagonal), the player could not finish their turn and play would be passed to the other player automatically. If the contestant finished with both tiles in the turn, they could draw more tiles. Players would try to guess the word either before drawing the tiles or after the letters were dropped into place on the board.
There were two bonus-colored tiles in this round: blue and pink. If players were able to guess the word after filling in a blue tile, they'd win $50 on top of all the other money they'd win at the end. For those correctly solving after placing a letter into a pink tile, the player would win $100. Meanwhile, regular tiles would add $25 to the bank/pot for the winner to take, should they win the Scrabble Sprint. The first player to win any three words would be the winner and would move on to Bonus Scrabble.
For about three months in 1985, when contestants guessed the word, the players had to spell the word correctly. Regular squares added $50 to the bank, blue with $100 and pink squares with $200. Most episodes were unproblematic, however when contestants started to spell MOSQUITOS, they both incorrectly spelled it and both were told it was wrong, though it was the right word. This rule was later abandoned after a bout a three month's run.
If the word was built on a letter from a bonus square word, the player was given the choice to solve the brand new word (given the clue beforehand). If not, the word was played in the classic style.
Both players kept any bonus money they won through guessing the words from bonus letters and such, and additional money was given throughout other rounds to double or triple their money from the day. However, in 1993, the money won from the Crossword Round's bonus square winnings would be added to a grand bank and be awarded to the winning contestant's jackpot.
Generally, following a format change in 1986, there would be two games of this played. The first round of this was between the player and the challenger from the previous day to go head-to-head in the Sprint, the winner would go on to face in Bonus Sprint then two new players would come out and play it all over again. The winner would go on to face two new contestants.

If all three stoppers were found, the next player had to take a wild guess at the word. If they could not solve it, it switched into Speedword mode. The remaining letters would be revealed in random order until only one remaining letter was left covered. Both players tried to guess that word; if no one figured it out, the word was thrown out and a makeup word was attempted. Rarely was the makeup word ever needed, as Speedword almost always got players to the answer.





, This round generally consisted of two segments. One segment was played to establish a time that the last player had to beat, and the other tried to beat that time. During the first segment, the player who won this past round/game set the time. The player stood behind a podium and, with a stopwatch timer, guessed a word. The display that was set in front of him (above him according to the TV screen to the viewer) would show a blank word at first. Much like in the Crossword Round, the host would tell the player of this round how many letters and a whimsical clue to the word. However, here, players were picking out letters to call out from a nearby screen - all letters were valid letters and there were no stoppers in any of them. At any time the player knew the word, they could stop their timer by hitting the maroon-red plunger/button in front of them. Most often, this started with either a 5 or 6 lettered word, but the amount of letters grew in complexity and no more than four puzzles (and what seems like all letters of the display the player had to guess - generally an eight or nine lettered word) here would set a ""time to beat"". Generally, there could be several minutes on the clock when the final puzzle was solved.

Watch the new Scrabble Sprint challenger from this episode. With this time, this player would try to beat the last player's score. Generally, this was the player from the previous day's show who was vying for additional money to add to their own bank of money. Generally, the stopwatch timer now became a countdown timer. The same words displayed in the same order, and this player had to solve all these same words to win the money. If they were able to beat the timer (if there was still time left on the board when the last clue was answered), they would win the bonus round money. However, if not, the first player (today's player) won the money and would come back the following day to face the next challenger.
Although the Sprint used to begin with three words, it was later increased to four words in 1985.
If the player incorrectly guessed the word, a ten second penalty was inflicted on the player and would be added to their stopwatch (first contestant) or countdown (second contestant) time.

During the first two years of the show, 1984 and 1985, two separate envelopes were drawn with different words that each players had to solve. However, this was later changed so that one set of words was used for both players to solve in the episode.



, This was an additional round that began in 1986's episodes following a special Scrabble specials week in September of that year (The $100,000 All-American Scrabble Tournament). The champion was generally the only one who competed in this version. Using the same set as the Scrabble sprint, players were given two final words. However, they were only given 10 seconds total to solve both words. The jackpot was generally $5,000! If the player won that day's playing they'd come back the next day and try and play again. If they still won, the bank was then set for $6,000 and so forth. However, they could only go five wins to finish as a player or had to become defeated at some point to exit from the Bonus Sprint.

Dependent on how much the players made in bonus money from the Crossword Puzzle Round, players generally competed for triple the bank money they banked from the Crossword Round. If they won 5 Bonus Rounds in a row, this generally gave them a $20k prize. After ten rounds, the player was given yet another $20k and was mandatorily retired., During the Crossword Round, each word was presented on a video monitor that had a copy of a Scrabble board. The sound effect used when the visual effects were seen was really neat and advanced.

, Chuck Woolery was the host of this show, over this show's long run. Although he had hosted other game shows, he really made a great impact on the way this game show was handled during its run.


There were a few times when Chuck Woolery wasn't the host, and Marc Summers (of Double Dare fame) stepped in instead.

, There were several weeks over each of the seasons where celebrities were featured instead of regular contestants. Two years in a row, a bunch of other game show hosts even came and played, and there were several other week-long specials that happened.

, This version of the game was hosted by NBC affiliates nationwide. It was shown during a half-hour block between 11:30 EST between the premier on 7/2/1984 and 9/4/87, buy was changed to 12:30 to 1pm between 9/7/87 and 3/24/89, and yet again to the half hour block at 10:00am between 3/27/89 and 3/23/90. It finally aired at 12:00pm between 1/18/93 and 6/11/93. In total, there were 1,335 episodes. 1,230 of those were shown between 1984 and 1990, and the remaining 105 were shown in 1993.


Reruns of the episodes were those episodes that aired on USA Network between September 16,1991 and October 13, 1995. However, there were no reruns of the 1993 series, since the cancellations after the show ended on June 11 1993., Both contestants were seated at an extended desk. In front of them the viewer would see a rectangle on which two star-like icons would be seen when no letters had been revealed. This block would fill with the letters as tiles were drawn. In front of the player was a slot where the tiles were inserted after use.


In the middle between the two players would be several tiles standing up. Although the number of tiles here differed depending on how many letters the word had, there would be one tile for each word and three stopper tiles that could be drawn. (In 1984, these tiles were a pinkish-red color with a yellow number, but by 1985 this changed to a blue with whitish-aqua numbers.) The set differed by a slightly different desk by the 1993, but still showed these same traits to the viewer and contestant.
During the Scrabble Sprint and Bonus Sprint Rounds, desks were only two separate podiums that contained only a microphone and a red stopper button the player could press. The lettered titles and desk disappeared and wasn't used for this portion of the game. Generally, the host stood between the two contestants without using a podium, while facing the contestant.

, Although for the first two years of the show a person by the name Jay Stewart announced the show, he was not hired back for the remainder of the seasons. During 1985-1990 and 1993, an announcer by the name of Charlie Tuna was used instead. Most fans could barely tell a difference between the two voices.

, Scrabble has had several different spin-offs that came as a result of this show including ""Scrabble Showdown,"" which aired on the TV station called ""The Hub"" way back in 2012. Scrabble also led to Scrabble Challenge, which was hosted by John O'Hurley and aired on GSN in 2002 but wasn't picked up to a full-series run (only 2 episodes still exist on YouTube). There are still some spin-offs that are still airing in the United Kingdom to this day with a slightly-different format but with the same name as the original one.

Identify your preferred dance style.,
Determine your dance goals.,
Find the right dance studio or school.,
Examine the costs of dance instruction.,
Review dance teacher bios to select ideal teachers.,
Request a dance schedule.,
Watch the selected dance classes.,
Take classes with different dance teachers.,
Choose a dance instructor who teaches the right dance style and level.,
Assess your dance progress.",How to Choose a Dance Instructor," Ballet, jazz, hip hop, tap and modern are just a few styles of dance from which to choose. If you are interested in dancing with a partner, you might choose a ballroom dance style, such as the tango, waltz or salsa.;
, Your goal may be to take dance classes with your fiancé to prepare for your wedding dance. If you're trying to lose weight and are bored with the gym, a dance class may be a replacement for gym activities. Alternatively, you may be interested in dance as a profession with the goal of becoming a performer, dance teacher or choreographer. Pinpointing your overall goal will help you to choose the right dance teacher.

, Based on your dance goals, identify the best type of dance studio. For example, to become a social ballroom dancer, you might locate a salsa class in a local community center. If you're interested in competing as a ballroom dancer, the best dance instructors will be those who have competition experience and teach in professional dance studios.


Search online or in the local yellow pages. Conduct an Internet search for dance studios in your local area. For example, if you are interested in learning hip hop, enter ""hip hop classes"" and the name of your city. If you are looking in the yellow pages, look for ""dance studios"" or ""dance schools.""

, Group dance classes cost less than 1-on-1 lessons. A group class may range from $10 to $20 (USD) per class. Buying group classes in bulk may result in a discount, depending on the dance school. Private dance lessons may cost from $30 to several hundred dollars (USD) per hour, depending on the teacher.

, Teacher bios generally highlight experience in performance, choreography and teaching. Look for information about training, dance specialty and performance experience. For example, if your goal is to perform with a modern dance company, choose a teacher who directs, or has performed with, this type of dance company.

, Ask the dance school to mail you a schedule or visit its website to view an online schedule. Select several classes that fit well with your daily routine.

, Many dance schools allow prospective students to observe classes. Observing dance classes allows you to examine the technique level and the dance teacher's interaction with the students.

, Teachers in professional dance environments are generally stricter and expect students to demonstrate focus and commitment. Recreational dance classes are typically more laid back, allowing students more time to learn, ask questions and enjoy the process.

, A dance teacher who is the right fit will help you achieve your goals at the right pace and level of enjoyment. For a dancer with professional aspirations, a community center dance teacher who moves slowly may cause frustration due to the slow pace of the class. A recreational dancer may find it stressful to learn from a teacher who is accustomed to teaching professional dancers with excellent movement memory.

, The first few dance classes with a new dance teacher can be challenging because you are getting to know one another and must become comfortable with the warm-up, dance style and teaching approach. However, after attending 5 to 6 classes with a chosen dance teacher, determine if the class is the right style, level and pace for your dance goals and needs.


Find a new dance teacher if necessary. Repeated injuries, frustration or boredom may be reasons to find a new dance teacher. You'll know that you have found the right dance teacher when you are progressing in your dance technique at the right pace and enjoying the learning process.

Understand the show that was a spin-off of this show.",How to Become a Fan of the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV Game Show," As the camera panned the audience who was cheering happily, the announcer for the show would scream into the camera ""All these people want to know"" then the theme music sung by the a capella group would chime in with their music of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" as the show's logo entered the picture. After this, the scene would segue into the greeting of players. During the first three seasons the players would be standing in the hallway prior to the main entry area of the stage where the show would be taped - some reading the newspaper, some using the phone, others just standing around waiting - though this was only how they were cast. During the fourth and fifth season of the show, players entered from the ""Chief's"" room door directly onto the stage.;
, Based upon the results of a National Geographic survey that indicated that Americans didn't know enough about their geography, this show was presented to alarmingly see just how much children knew and understood about geography in a series of questions which resulted in the capture of a crook and the master hench-woman herself, Carmen Sandiego. (You'll see game play information below.), Each of these contestants would be called ""gumshoes"" because they would be spying for clues and trying to solve a mystery of which henchman took a piece of a location. Each gumshoe was informed of who took the loot and sometimes even tried to discuss the crook's reason for stealing such a priceless item. During season 2 only, the viewer would see new graphics be presented where a file cabinet's drawer would open and discuss the crook, but the ultimate knowledge that players needed to know wasn't really what was in the drawer but what clues were given otherwise., Round one was rather easy. Through a variety of sketches and clues, players would take guesses at trying to track down the episode's crook. The three contestants would be awarded a free 50 points to begin the game.

Research on the Lightning Round to the show. Questions relating to the locations of where the loot was stolen from was called the Lightning round. Unlike what you'd find in rounds that go faster with a name similar to ""lightning"", this didn't involve fast questions. Starting with season 3, the stage would flash with ""lightning effects"" but without loosing the power. If the player buzzing in answered it correctly, they would be awarded 5 crime bucks. If they didn't answer or buzzed in and were incorrect, they wouldn't loose any points but wouldn't gain these extra points.
Watch the comedy breaks in the show. The Chief would call the host (described later) into her office. Normally this would be a comedy break in the show after a period of 5 or so airtime minutes, during which both would mention the ultimate prize of winning the show - an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in the continental United States (during season 1) or an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in North America (seasons 2 and 3). Most of the way through season 3, they introduced a new bit. Viewers could enter a contest - after writing down what was stolen and from where over the course of 4 episodes, the viewers could send in this information in an envelope (you got-to remember, this was a time before the Internet was well-known) and would be entered into a contest - some people won these contests as was displayed on screen. (Each winning contest winner would receive a Carmen Sandiego T-shirt).
Watch the Training exercise that began after the host met with the Chief (who was the announcer who'll you meet with later in this article). Training exercises began after the Chief's sketch. The gumshoes each opened one of three trash cans to grab a card. On it had a flag of the country in which the crook was hiding out, along with questions relating to the clue that the host had to answer. Such things included ""language of the location"" or ""major religion"" or one of many others. Play later moved inside to try and find out this location. Players who buzzed in and answered correctly would win 10 crime point/bucks. Players who didn't wouldn't loose any points, but wouldn't gain any either. This clue game only began in the 5th and final season of the show - something that wasn't very developed when the show ended.
Understand the Phone Tap. All of a sudden, the host would talk to the gumshoes that ACME intercepted a call between Carmen and the crook that would lead to clues of where the crook was hiding yet again. These phone taps would always happen. If the player guessed in correctly, they'd win 10 Crime buck points. If incorrect, they wouldn't loose anything.
Research the Chase round. The Chase was a rather weird round. Following a sketch that had several of Rockapella's members chasing each other one in back of the other (as a comedy to introduce the segment, though this comedy sketch only began starting with season 3), players would try to track the crook through various locations on one of several maps. From the location according to that received during the phone tap, players would guess this country, mountain or (in later seasons outside of season 1 and 2) river and, if correct receive 5 crime buck points. If they didn't answer correctly, they wouldn't be penalized.

Final clue destination question: At first, the host would ask the players to wager points out of their available points - anywhere between 0 and 50 only in increments of 10 - of which they'd have cards to denote each. Rockapella would sing a classic tune that all viewers knew by the end of the series though most would be not typeable here since it had a hint of incorrectly understood lyrics (until you checked the closed captioning) on the show. The gumshoes would try to wager based on their knowledge of the map on the TV screen they had in front of them. Clues would be given, then one last question was asked. The players would try and answer the question. If they were right, they'd gain their points they wagered. However, unlike other clue answers, if they guessed incorrectly, they'd loose these points. Wagering worked best when you lots of knowledge towards each of the areas on the map board - sometimes this would be the United States or North America.
The top two-scoring teams passed into Round 2. The third gumshoe left the episode with some departing gifts that more often that not contained a electronic address book tool (that was the envy of every kid before the Internet, PDAs and iPhones were well-known).


During season 1, before the gumshoes and host left for the location obtained in the very last question, the host would segue into a Photo Recon session then leave for the location's room that was used for round 2, carrying suitcases as if they really traveled from one place to another. However, past season 1, things got a little hairy. Photo Recon happened after they arrived in the new location starting with season 2, and in season 3 there was even a skit where monochrome videos were shown and you'd hear voiceovers of the Chief and the host bickering over how they were getting to their destination. In Season 5, they changed the walk into something a little more ""virtual"" and they were beamed up (and later beamed down) after holding their breaths into an showerhead-like external modem that came down from the ceiling. They grabbed bags as they walked out the door. Photo Recon was ever rarely anything useful for the next round but to explain the place to the gumshoe player and what was up on their board to choose from and to more inform the player of what that location had to hold.

, Sometimes called the Photo Recon round in a special room that looked like a train station, Round 2 generally started with Photo Recon starting with the second season after the host placed a special ""card"" or other object that was supposed to visually transition over to the chief into the machine-board. The boards contained a total of fifteen landmark locations from which the gumshoes had to find three items. To complete the board, they had to find the loot from the days show, then the Warrant then the crook (and only in that order). If they found any of these special tiles, they would be able to choose another tile. This round was much like the game of Memory that you might have played as a kid. If they found tiles that had footmarks on them; these were bad and they'd lose their turn and turn would be passed to the next player of the two. Generally, when a player found either the loot, warrant or crook, their house band Rockapella would sing what they found - and even starting with season 2 would change what they'd found into things a little more comical. Until all three have been found. Season 3 added Rockapella singing that the team had found a dud when they located the footprint tile. Sometimes, the crook had a special ""send-off"" - (Patty Larceny would be sung ""P-P-P-Patty"", but there were other notable variations once you've seen each type in action a few times.

The only time when the gumshoe ended up choosing this order first, without seeing other tiles, the gumshoe Ali Haider was at the board. On his very first pick which was the very first player of the round, he chose all three of the correct tiles in the correct order. Was this just a fluke, or was he briefed beforehand off-screen? He was later asked to find a $100 savings bond hidden within the remaining tiles where the footsteps tiles would have appeared - (spoiler for remainder of the sentence) he later missed finding this tile but was found just below one of the tiles he picked. You can find this episode online in the case called The Gateway Getaway (episode 6 of season 1) if you look on YouTube.

, The gumshoe then walked over and put the crook away. There was a metal rope (with a green handle loop at the bottom edge) that the gumshoe would pull down a fair distance which would trigger the graphics of the program which would put the crook behind bars and out of sight.

Shortly thereafter, the departing player would be told what they'd depart with as per gifts. Most often times, this included a year's subscription of National Geographic World and/or a communicator like the one handed to the departing contestant from round 1.

, The winning gumshoe then was asked to write down where they'd like to go if they won the grand prize which was an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere in the continental United States (season 1) or North America (seasons 2-5) in a portfolio styled notebook. This segment would generally be oversung by Rockapella's classic song that began 'Where do you wanna' go? Yeah, yeah!"" then concluded with misunderstood audible words to their same song. This segment would generally last about 60 seconds - therefore, the answers would generally be written down quickly and there would be no artistic works inside the portfolio., The crook would then call the set that would be received in the telephone box on the wall. The crook would tell the player where they last knew Carmen would be. During season 1 this could have included the United States, South America, Europe, Asia, or Africa. During season 2-5, United States expanded to North America. After a classic host moment of the Chief saying ""Greg"" and the host saying ""Let's go to the map"", they'd run across to the set the final challenge would be set up, and where if completed correctly the gumshoe would capture Carmen Sandiego. This is the last time the viewer hears about the Crook who stole the loot., After the introduction, the player and host would run over to the final challenge of the game which was a huge map on the floor that was a political map to a continent with several circular placemarks on it. There was a huge map of the continent or United States (season 1)/North America (all others) placed on the ground where along with several dots on it. During season 3-5, there'd be additional arrows that indicated bodies of water. The gumshoe had 45 seconds (60 seconds if the map was Asia) to locate the 7 items that the host would read off. Each item was read off and they used blue-light special like markers to mark the location of the item on the map. If they got their answer right, great! If they got it wrong, they could move it one time. If they got it wrong on the second attempt, they were asked to leave the marker where it was - few understood that and many picked up the marker to move it - but didn't get too far following that., While some players won this round and captured Carmen (and in turn the newspaper clipping would show Carmen being put behind bars of a jail cell), many times the player missed her and she'd escape (no bars would be seen and she'd be in the newspaper clipping looking for the next thing to steal in her side profile way). A newspaper listing would come up on screen if she escaped capture, and by the 4th season her logo in the newspaper would inevitably disappear (in other seasons preceding the 4th, her face profile logo would stay on the page. If the player was able to make it, the portfolio would be tossed to the host who'd reveal the prize vacation the player won. For those who didn't make it for the grand prize, their portfolio was never shown, and all they won was the generic prize package instead., During round 1, each player had to grab a cardboard sign from in front of them. Upon verbally answering, they'd have to hold up their sign that stated what they were verbally going to say in front of their chest until all players have answered or the answer had been mentioned. (As you'll learn later, for the episode containing guest stars along with the gumshoes to help them out, only one teammate had to hold the sign while the guest-star verbally answered the choice.) During the Photo Recon round, players stood in front of a board containing many Memory-like pieces that turned and players gave their response verbally. In the Map Round, players ran around a giant board with several ""blue light special""-type lightpoles that strobe-light-flashed a red light when placed at the right location to mark their answers., As players finished the final map puzzle or had run out of time, they'd look at where the player was going (if they lost or didn't finish the map correctly, they didn't look at what their choice was.) then the host handed over the duties of telling the player what they won to the announcer/the Chief who'd say that they won several things (but this varied) and also their status with ACME changed from ""gumshoe"" to sleuth. Then, the scene would segue one more time; the host would remind the player what their last job was for the show (apparently being briefed before the show on this). Both the host and the player would say ""Do it, Rockapella"" as they cheered with throwing their left arm into the air. During the credits (of seasons 2-5), the audience was allowed to come up on top of the map to dance and sing with the theme song. However, for season 1, the audience wasn't that lucky. The Chief would always state ""This is Lynne Thigpen speaking for Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, and remember, and she'd continue with something rhythmically comical of prose.

Sometimes during the first season, the Chief would call a contestant into her office. She'd ask the member to answer a single geography question. Whether or not they got this right, they were asked to return as a contestant for the following season. If they got it right, they were given a Carmen Sandiego sweatshirt, but if they got it wrong, would be given a National Geographic World Atlas instead.
According to the written statements at the end of the credits, all gumshoes were briefed before the show as to the rules, but was stated that this was the case by the end of the show.
Also, none of the season 1 episodes ever returned in repeats. In 1991, the Soviet Union breakup happened during the off-season and PBS didn't want inaccurate information floating around to the outside world after the breakup.
Lastly, there was a verbal statement that ended up being spoken that said ""All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded."" However, during the second season, this wasn't mentioned except in text on the screen during the credits.

, During the question rounds at the beginning, players would be shown their question and a map of the area on an older-style TV set. During the first season, the TV would be turned on by the host, but this segue would later be discontinued and ended up coming on and staying on without needing to be turned on by the host following the first season., Greg Lee was this show's host, and although this was his only real TV game show he was really appointed host of, he really got into his work and enjoyed the challenge of hosting this show. The onstage title he was given was that of ""ACME's Special Agent in Charge of Training New Recruits"" (later changed from the third season onwards to Senior Agent in Charge of Training New Recruits"". Greg would generally enter the show with a blue suit jacket and a tie with a white dress shirt underneath it. He'd generally open the stage door to enter the staging area at the beginning of each and every episode. He would later leave the set prior to the Jailtime Challenge round when the players would need to be promoted to the next round, grabbing his hat in between. (During season 5, Greg would leave this stage using a digital graphic of the players and him disappearing through a modem connection beaming them up and dropping them where they needed to go, but this looked awful to the viewer and was one of the causes of the demise of this program.,
Double Trouble were a pair of almost-conjoined twins who almost always mirror each other in their monochrome skin colors.
Eartha Brute is a muscle-heavy workaholic. She even exemplifies that of a workaholic when she wears her pink singlet uniform and VILE initialed-weight belt.
Kneemoi is an round alien from another planet out of our galaxy. Although this villain is pretty much a pink ball of ectoplasm, this villain can change herself into any form and color she desires.
Patty Larceny is a blonde-haired schoolgirl who has an beyond just-giggly attitude but who has just a kindle and polite manner under her skin without letting her attitude show.
RoboCrook is a robot spoof who appeared to be the crook beginning in an episode in the third season. It was originally mentioned that his real name was ""RoboCrook Unit 059"" but those additional details were rarely mentioned and he was never called this full name when he was the crook for the show.
Sarah Nade is a punk-rock teenager with a rainbow colored hairdo.
Top Grunge is a muscle-builder, smelly motorcyclist. He always has flies hanging over him. He rides a motorcycle that is definitely not finely-tuned: it always has smoke coming out the back. But the viewer never sees this biker without his large sunglasses which always stand-out from the normal appearance of your traditional biker.
Vic the Slick is of the salesman variety who always comes dressed in a polyester suit and tie, as well as shifty eyes and well-combed black hair. Most often times, Vic would hit on Carmen calling her ""sweetheart"" and ""doll face"". Apparently, he had this special love for the titular character, Carmen Sandiego, though he knew he would never catch up with her in the end.
Wonder Rat is a superhero parody who wears a rat costume who is strapped via a bungee cord to a flying helicopter.
Carmen Sandiego was the ultimate crook who was the ultimate person who each gumshoe player had to ""catch"" at the end of the show. She'd generally wear a red down-coat, along with a red long-brimmed South-American-like hat and black slim gloves on her hands. We rarely saw her lower extremities, so what she wore there still remains a mystery. The viewers ultimate goal of each show was to watch the gumshoe catch her after successfully completing the World Map, and jailing the crook after the Jailhouse Challenge round. She'd be the instigator of the group of crooks and would always speak to the gang in several portions of the episode including the Phone Tap in the middle of the Questions/Clues round.

, While this was described in the Question round with players standing at a podium with a long desk, a TV screen for the Host, and window and several clippings up on the walls with the host in the Question round room, you could also see a door that led to a hallway. Another door to the left of the contestants (from the viewpoint of the viewer) led to the chief's office. The Chief's office looked like the office of a spy and a desk filled with paperwork was shown along with file cabinets and papers galore, several books on a bookshelf (that included information on the crooks that were in place during each seasons' episodes) and various other knick-kacks. Past this, you could never see any other round's info until the round came up. During the Photo Recon, the set looked like a train station followed by a board that had several turn-around spots. Players stood in back of a solid set of a line - the board was set up a little higher than normal on a slight pedestal that only was emphasized for the board alone. During the Map scene, you could often see the audience situated around the edges to the Map room (though Seldom you could see the final Map from the introductory sequence). As was described before, this Map changed from show to show so this set looked different almost every single time. (As you'll see later, things looked quite different when a spin-off of this show occurred and had looked more like the inside of a Star-Trek like space ship/time traveling device and rooms with Portals that will be described later.), The player's costume's never changed. Each player would wear a red sleeveless vest, along with a yellow dress shirt. They would wear this same costume throughout the entire show and never had to change it until the episode was over. The shirts the players would have on would contain a neck piece that would be folded down, and on the vest would be the ""ACME Crimenet"" logo on the right side, and their yellow, square nametag would be on their left., Rockapella was a common stage band that performed at this show, and who still performs to this day. They acted to introduce the Chase round, and sung several things, helped with singing clues when the clue needed to be sung (this didn't happen too often) and they even helped out with other unsung clues in the hallway. They helped sing the reprised version at the end of the show, and could even be spotted during the balcony(season 1 only) and hallway seasons(following seasons) and at other times. They were an integral portion of the well-used cast who performed their jobs rather well. There were 4 members of this house band when this band performed in the show., Although there were times when special episodes occurred, most often times episodes would air as if the people on it were just normal contestants. In one episode in the fifth season, Greg Lee and Marc Summers (host of the popular Nickelodeon kids game show called Double Dare and it's more current inclusionary programs called Super Sloppy Double Dare and Family Double Dare) co-hosted together for a few moments and even introduced the clue together for a question. On another episode during the second season(first episode of the second season), celebrity guests helped the players out - including a special reminder for viewers to watch their show they were a part of during the phone conversation after the Jailtime Challenge round prior to having the villain tell them where Carmen would be sending them to complete her challenge - the only time guest stars would help the gumshoe players out., Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego aired for five seasons generally at the 5pm ET slot daily every weekday of each week but only from September to December on the viewer's public broadcasting networks such as PBS under the discretion of several sponsors and the support of ""viewers like you"". It was produced by WQED Pittsburgh and WGBH Boston. It generally aired without advertisements in a 30 minute time slot and would never rerun an episode twice (all episodes were ""fresh out of the box""). It had 5 seasons on air and it aired 295 episodes during this time span.Season 1 aired every weekday between September 30, 1991 and December 27,1991 airing 65 episodes.Season 2 aired every weekday between September 28, 1992 and December 25, 1992 airing 65 episodes.Season 3 aired every weekday between September 27, 1993 and December 24, 1993 airing 65 episodes.Season 4 aired every weekday between October 10, 1994 and December 23, 1994 airing 50 episodes.Season 5 aired every weekday between October 9, 1995 and December 22,1995 airing 50 episodes.There was an episode that never aired but apparently was an un-aired pilot episode that was titled ""Auld Lang Gone"" where the contestants were tracking Patty Larceny and the person captured Carmen San Diego as well through the Map of Europe., The announcer for the show had a varied responsibility. Although she was known more often as just ""The Chief"", she partook to mocking fun at the tough role her Chief responsibility took her, and even starting with the third and fourth season helped transition the group (with the help of Greg in her office - another common response during most episodes) to helping to show past winners of the weekly game where viewers would collect information from four shows (including what was stolen and from where and then mailed those in to the show). This person's name was Lynne Thigpen who went on to have other jobs in the entertainment industry including more major major-character roles out in the workforce., When this show went off the air after the 1995 season due to it's decreasing popularity, another show picked up where this show left off. And while Thigpen (explained earlier) reprised her role, things changed. The show that aired was called ""Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego"" and even that show didn't last all that long either - basing the clues on time periods instead of world's popular places and things. It included new villains and changed the host, included a famous robot motor that would transport it's players through time (called the ""Chronoskimmer"") and introduced a 3-person crew that would operate it's motor. On this show during the bonus run, players would enter time portals and exit through to catch Carmen. However, it only ran 2 seasons."

Show up to the dance up to 30 minutes early because some places have instructional periods before the dance actually begins.,
When people start to show up, don't hide from them, be social.,
Decide who will be the 'woman' once you have found your partner.,
With your partner, line up in which ever set (line of dancers) needs more couples.

,
Listen.,
Once the music starts, don't be afraid to make mistakes.,

",How to Contra Dance," These beginner lessons will usually be mentioned on the flier or the website for the organization running the dance.;
, Contra dancers are friendly people who are more than willing to help beginners find their rhythm.

, It's acceptable for women to dance with women and men to dance with men. Some places will have ties that the women can wear to denote that they are dancing the male part. In addition, some male dancers wear skirts to show that they are willing to dance the female parts.

,, All dances are led by a caller, or somebody telling the dancers what moves to do- listen to what the caller is saying.


The dance will be walked through one or two times before the music starts, pay close attention to what you need to do.

Firstly, it's important to remember that you can do two types of Burlesque routines.,
Find some appropriate music - not too fast but not too slow.,
Wear high heels - this will automatically help your posture and give you that sexy look.,
Buy your accessories and costume.,
Choreograph.,
Also, learning how to strip is a good thing to know before you choreograph.,
Perfect the format.",How to Burlesque Dance," The first is the traditional solo-strip where you will take your clothes off as much as you want. The second is a chorus dance, where you can take off your top maybe and dance the rest in lingerie or a frou- frou- little petticoat and Collette. It's your choice how far you go!;
, Traditional Burlesque looks good coupled with big band, or 1940s show music, but it can really be danced to anything you like provided you keep the mood! If you go up tempo, be sure you can actually keep up!

, But make sure you can actually dance in them! Try twirling around in them, and if you stumble they're too high! 3"" heel height is best for beginners.

, Make sure it's removable in the space and time you have allotted, and make sure it's not daffy or fiddly to remove. Zippers are great. You should only wear tight-lacing corsets and the like if you are a seasoned wearer. Basic costume includes: a fitted bustier, a nice bra and matching panties, a girdle or wide suspender belt/garters, and stockings, and opera or elbow length gloves. You can accessories with a feather boa from a fancy dress store if you're working on the cheap, or you can go more glamorous with your props.

, Burlesque is about cheeky seduction, so don't be afraid to smile, flirt, wink, and gasp! Try to learn a few of the following moves first before putting into a routine:


To do a glove peel put both gloves on. Now using your right hand remove one finger at a time form your left hand, when all five have been loosened pull of the glove off and languidly toss it aside. Now do the same with the other hand.
Use your hands and fingers and make each movement exaggerated. Remember to bend your back, keep your legs straight and stick your behind out.
To perform a successful and tantalizing shimmy, quiver the bosom by alternately moving your shoulders back and forth. Do this with extended arms for a glam look, or put your hands in your lap or behind your back for a coy and sweet look. You can combine this with a cross-step where to walk left whilst facing your audience, you cross your left leg over your right leg and then pull your right leg out to a normal stance again. Try two steps each way whilst shimmying- best done with arms out or hand on hips.
A proper 'booty shake' can be done easily once you get out of your heels. Stand on the balls of your feet, and then alternately bend each knee. Then add some hip movement into the equation and you're all go!
To do a tantalizing step backwards to move away from your audience, put one foot behind the other, and swing your hip around to the back circling to the same side you stepped back with. It doesn't sound like much, but placed right, it's seductive!

, Make sure you can do it elegantly, which means without crunching up and bending over! If you must bend or reach to peel something, then use a chair to sit or balance on/against. Try to be seductive and sexy, without rushing or fumbling.

, You absolutely must have a strut before the strip, present yourself to your audience! First impressions count. Try striking a pose, and then have a little walk around- a circle will do nicely. In your routine, it's important to space out dancing and stripping equally, if indeed you are stripping. The more comes off, the more dance in between will seem appropriate. A classic bump and grind can be altered in so many way by bending forwards, bumping to the side, changing the rhythm... Experiment with it. A simple spring forwards of the hips is a bump, and a circling of the hips from front to back is a grind. Feel free to grind and swing your hips all the time during your routine though.

"
Decide which dance style, or at least which genre, you most want to learn and practice.,
Dance with as many people as possible, and learn as much as you can while you're at it.,
Choose a dance partner whose personality you're comfortable with.,
Make yourself a more attractive dance partner, in return, by following a few considerate practices:


Groom yourself neatly.,
Decide ahead of time whether you're open to a romantic relationship with your dance partner.",How to Choose a Dance Partner,"


This narrows down the pool of potential dance partners considerably, because if he's into swing and you only want to dance ballroom or Latin, your partnership will be short-lived.;
,


This gives you the broadest exposure to different dance styles, lead and follow styles, and also ""dance personalities""--that is, each person's individual approach to dance. Not only does this give you context for determining your own personal approach to and preference for dance, it also gives you a chance to decide which sort of dancer you're most comfortable with.
Although the basic steps to any given form of music are fairly universal, the range for interpretation and expression really is endless. So if you meet somebody that says you're dancing wrong, you could be making a mistake--or you just might be dancing with the wrong person.

, Remember, you're going to be spending extended amounts of time with this person, and the occasional creative conflict is inevitable.


The ideal dance partner should also be at about the same ability level as you are, although if you're otherwise compatible, you might be comfortable dancing with somebody who's more or less experienced than you are.
You can always learn new techniques, but personality is difficult to change--so if you have to choose between one or the other, personality trumps ability.
Select a partner who has a similar level of commitment to dancing as you do. In other words, you should be looking to spend similar amounts of time dancing, and have similar goals for your time together, whether they're fitness, competition or performance oriented.

, Wear deodorant and clean clothing.
Avoid eating garlic, onions, or other strong-smelling foods just before you go out dancing.
Keep your own body weight under control. This doesn't have anything to do with whether you're fat or lean. Instead, it means being well-balanced at all times so that you don't have to lean on or fall onto your partner for support.

, Politely make your position clear from the start, and stick with it.


You're going to spend a lot of time together in close physical contact, so developing some sort of friendship is inevitable, and romantic relationships between dance partners are common. That doesn't mean you have to date or be romantic; keeping clear boundaries from the start will help keep all parties involved from getting confused.

"
Hear the music.,
Bend your knees.,
Alternate with your chest and hips.,
Add some direction to your move.,
Put your hands in the air.,
Bounce with the rhythm.",How to Booty Dance," Booty dancing is all about rhythm. If you are off the beat of the song you are dancing to, it will not sync well with the rest of the dance floor, and may become off time itself. The meter of the song is the rhythm that you want to dance with.;
, Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and add just a slight bend to your knees. This will trigger the rest of the motions.

, Start with your hips. Like most forms of dancing, booty dancing is all about the hips. Move your hips backward so that your booty protrudes out behind you. While doing this, though, make sure you puff your chest out at the same time. Use your shoulders to enunciate your chest. Make the motion fluid and use your knees to balance and push you while you do this back and forth motion.

, Now when you pull forward and back, take it to the side a bit, alternating to the right and left. Now you are no longer just bouncing there, but actually dancing.

, You may hold your arms chest high with your hands in front of your chest and your elbows out or, alternatively just keep your hands in front of you.

, Bend your knees up and down as you do the back and forth motion. If you become more advanced, you can try methodically working your way up and down while you dance. This may be hard on your knees, but will win you respect on the dance floor every time.

Hold one of your arms out straight from your body.,
Bend down the wrist of that arm.,
Raise your hand and elbow.,
Straighten your arm.,
Pop your shoulder.,
Repeat the actions in reverse with your second arm.,
Do a chest pop.,
Do the walk and pop.,
Pop your legs.",How to Body Pop," It doesn't matter which arm you start with. Just remember to keep it relaxed and loose. If you're too tense, then you won't be able to pop; you can think of ""popping"" as a releasing some of that tension. Don't lock your elbow -- keep it relaxed. Make sure to keep your hand flat and your chest high, with your neck loose. Know that releasing the tension from your body is essential to any kind of dancing, especially popping.


You can even stretch before you begin, if you think that this will help you loosen up a bit.
Don't stand there with stiff legs. Instead, keep your feet shoulder width, or even a little further apart, and keep a bit of a bend in your knees. Though the pop requires strong isolation, focusing on one area of your body, the energy should actually come from your legs, popping out the top of your body. You'll need that spring in your legs to help you generate the energy in your arms.;
, To do this in the most effective way possible, imagine that there's a string tied to your fingers. While keeping your arm taut, pretend that someone is pulling on the string, bringing your fingers and your hand down until your wrist is at a 90-degree angle to the ground. Try to do this without moving the rest of your arm or body. Keep facing forward; resist the temptation to look at the moving hand.


Keep your knees slightly bent, springing a bit on your legs with every slight move in your arms. You can use this little bounce to set up a nice rhythm for yourself.

, Now, raise your elbow until it's even with your shoulder, and raise your hand so it's back to being flat again, nearly parallel to the floor. The idea of popping is to pop one part of your body at a time while the rest of your body remains stationary. When you pop with your arm like this, the popping action runs from your hand up to your shoulder. So once your wrist is 90-degrees, you raise your elbow with the same idea, popping it up toward the air, while bringing your hand back to its original position -- flat, while your chest is high.


Really, you're letting a wave of energy travel from your shoulder to your fingertips, and back up through your arm again.

, Now, bring your elbow down until your arm is nearly straight and parallel to the floor. The wave of energy has run fully from your hand, through your elbow, and is making its way up to your shoulder. That's why it's important to slip your arm back to its original position.


Keep your hips centered, your head and neck nice and tall, and your look focused in the center as you do this.

, As you transition from your elbow up in the air and back down to your arm's original position, you should raise your shoulder up while you bring the rest of your arm in toward your body. The raising motion of your shoulder is the ""pop"" you are looking for. When you pop your shoulder, the movement should look unexpected, almost as if it were a reflexive jerk or shiver.


You can even slightly pop your other shoulder, to help the move transition to the other side of your body.

, Now, begin by popping your shoulder, and then straighten your arm, raise your hand and elbow, bend down the wrist of your arm, and work backwards to get your arm into the original straight position you began with your other hand. Then, let the wave run through your outstretched arm and back into the shoulder, and then move the ""pop"" in the other direction starting with your other shoulder, and so on.


The wave should travel from the tips of the fingers of one arm, up the arm, and then over to the other side, so the popping motion flows from one side of your body to the other.

, To pop your chest, stand with an exaggerated stance, with your feet about half a foot out each past your shoulders, with a good bend in both knees. Stay bouncy with your legs, bend down slightly, and then isolate your ribs, coming forward and up with your chest, and then dropping back down, with a slight hunch. You should not use your shoulders or roll them during this process, which is a common mistake. Repeat this motion, keeping those feet bouncy, bending down slightly, and then popping your chest up.


Think of it as doing a ""chest bump"" with the air. It's a similar gesture, putting everything into the chest while developing just a slight bounce and upward motion in the arms and elbow.
For an exaggerated movement, you can place one hand on your chest to mimic a heartbeat when you're popping. Place a flexed hand in the middle of your chest, flatten your hand as you pop your chest forward, and then flex it again as you drop back.






You can even add more moves to this technique by bending down and moving slightly to the right, popping your chest, then swooping over to your left side, popping your chest, and going back and forth between the left and the right.

, To walk and pop, simply act like you're just walking down the street, moving your feet and arms at a count of one or two. Every time you count, take a step, slightly popping your knees, letting the motion travel up your leg and down again, while also popping your arm with every slight movement. Keep your arms out at your sides, in an exaggerated motion, as if you were still doing the arm pop, while incorporating your feet and popping your feet and knees out in the process, too.It can take a little while to get the coordination down, but once you get used to popping with every count, the rest should be cake.

, You can pop your legs on their own, or add a pop to your legs while you're popping your arms, chest, or other parts of your body. To pop your legs, just practice flexing and releasing your quads. Then, move back slightly with one leg, flexing your quad as you move back, and then release the muscle in your legs once you move your leg back to its normal position. You shouldn't come forward with your leg, only backwards, and then back to the standing position. You also shouldn't bend down or get low to do this.


Once you've mastered the pop on one leg, learn to pop both legs at the same time, not moving your feet but pivoting on them to the right and left as you pop your legs.

Stand with your feet together.,
Stand on the balls of your feet.,
Bounce up and down.",How to Booty Clap1," Your feet should be at a normal stance with feet under the hips, but less than shoulder width apart. Take a wider stance if necessary to feel balanced. However, feet closer together is the norm. , Slowly start to rise up on your toes and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. If you don’t have a good sense of balance, or you feel as though you might fall over, then take this opportunity to take a slightly wider stance. But, if balance is not a problem, keep your feet closer together.

, Once you’ve stabilized yourself on your toes, start to bounce up and down quickly. Do not squeeze your butt cheeks. You should feel your butt cheeks start to clap against each other.


This method works best for people that already have a big butt.
Try putting your hands against a wall for support. Leaning on the wall will allow you to bounce faster without feeling like you’re going to fall over.
To do a variation on this move, you can squat down with your feet shoulder width apart, and bend your torso over about 45 degrees. Then, bounce up and down on the balls of your feet.
Practice a lot. It sounds simple, but many people still have trouble with it and are unable to do it.

Stand with your feet together.,
Stand on the balls of feet.,
Bend your knees slightly.",How to Booty Clap2," Again, just as before, the feet don’t need to be right next to each other. Stand in a normal stance with the feet under the hips and less than shoulder width apart. If you feel more comfortable, bring your feet closer together so that there is only an inch (2.54 cm) or two (5.08 cm) of space between your feet.If you are going to place your feet closer together, lean up against a wall or chair for extra support.

, Slowly, rise up on your toes and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. Use a wall or chair to help you balance if necessary. Or, you can take a little bit of a wider stance to help you balance.

, Then, straighten them. Then, bend your knees again and straighten them. Do this slowly at first. Then, move much faster -- as fast as you can go. Once you start moving faster, you’ll have to limit the range of motion, so it won’t look like you’re bending your knees.


In other words, your knee bending movements won’t be as large as before. Bounce slightly on your toes while you bend your knees. The two movements together help the booty clap. You should hear a clapping sound when you have done it correctly.
This method is easiest those that have a big butt already because it helps the butt jiggle.

"
Stand with your feet together.,
Rise up on your toes.,
Arch your back.,
Rotate your hips down forcefully.",How to Booty Clap3," Similar to the other methods, your feet can be at a normal stance less than shoulder width apart. However, if you feel more comfortable take a slightly wider stance. In this case you might have four(10.16 cm) or five inches (12.7 cm) of space between your feet., Use your calf and thigh muscles to rise up on your toes. So, shift your weight to your toe box and balance there. Hold on to a wall or chair to help you balance if necessary.

, As you do this, your chest should poke out. If it helps, think about making a curve in your back that looks like a C. Stand in front of a mirror, and readjust to make sure you don’t look awkward. Your movements should look natural.

, Then, move them up again. Continue to bounce as you do this. After you move your hips down, they should almost naturally spring up again because of the momentum. Then, repeat the motions -- pelvis down and pelvis up. Bounce as fast as you can, and you should hear your butt cheeks clap together. You know when you’re doing it right when your butt cheeks make a sound like they are clapping.


Use your body weight and the slight bend in your knee to help you create this bouncing motion. When you move your pelvis down, bend your knees slightly.
Your arch in your back should help you be mindful of rotating the pelvis instead of just using your legs.

, Even if you stretch in class, it's still a good idea to stretch before to prepare your body. After all, more stretching means less chances of an injury.

, It's better than being late. Ask questions if you have any because your teacher will appreciate it.

, Don't worry if other girls are better than you. Dancing comes more naturally to some than others. One day, you could be as good or even better than them!

, It doesn't matter if you're better than the other girls or not. Also, showing off just ticks the other girls off.

, Bring water in case you get thirsty while working out. It's important to drink water so you don't become dehydrated.

, Have a smile on your face. It will make you feel positive, and happy. Smiling is contagious. The other dancers will feel happy too.

Practice opposites mode.,
Practice split-time opposites mode.,
Experiment with switching between the four basic poi moves and connecting them in creative ways.,
Learn intermediate and advanced poi moves.,
Light your poi on fire when you are fully comfortable with the moves.",How to Become a Fire Dancer2," Kite grip is the most common way to grip poi. If it feels comfortable to you once you learn the grip, you can stick with this grip or experiment with other grips.


Hold the strap of one poi between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. Hold it by the right end of the strap so that the strap is pointing to the left.
With your left hand, twist the strap towards you by ninety degrees to form a loop.
Put your left middle and ring fingers through the opening in the loop. Let the loop come all the way over the two fingers to right below the first knuckle.
Run the leash between your left middle and ring ringers so that when your hand is facing upwards the leash falls down towards the floor.
Repeat these steps with to get the other poi on your right hand. , This is a popular alternative grip. If it feels more comfortable than kite grip, use it.


Turn your left hand palm up.
With your right hand, hold the loop of one poi open.
Put your left hand index and ring fingers through the loop. Let the loop come all the way over the two fingers to right below the first knuckle. Your middle finger should not be in the loop; it should be out and resting on top of the loop. Looking down at your left hand, the loop should come over your index finger, under your middle finger, and over your ring finger.
With your left palm facing up, the leash should fall straight down to the floor. , This is the first and easiest of the four basic poi modes. The goal is to get each poi spinning in simultaneous circles on either side of your body.


Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable.
Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body.
Spin both poi forward simultaneously using your arms, wrists, and hands to create momentum. To help visualize the motion, imagine that you are spinning two levers in a circle on either side of your body.
The movement of the circles should be simultaneous, so that the movement of each poi perfectly mirrors the other.
Once you’ve mastered same time mode with the poi traveling forwards (clockwise), use the same technique but reverse the motion so the circles are traveling backwards (counterclockwise). , This is the second of the four basic poi modes. The goal is get each poi spinning in successive circles on either side of your body.


Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable.
Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body.
Spin the right hand poi forward, making a circular motion.
When the end of the right hand poi reaches the top arc of the circle, begin spinning the left hand poi in another circle.
This will look and feel much different than same time mode. With split time mode, you are creating successive circles, so that when the end of one poi is at 180 degrees, the end of the other poi should be at 0.
Once you’ve mastered split time mode with the poi traveling forwards (clockwise), use the same technique but reverse the motion so the circles are traveling backwards (counterclockwise). , This is the third of the four basic poi modes. The goal is have one one poi traveling in a forwards (clockwise) circular motion while the other travels in a backwards (counterclockwise) circular motion, with the ends of both poi passing each other at 0 degrees and 180 degrees.


Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable.
Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body.
Spin the right poi forwards like you did with same time mode.
At the same time, spin the left poi backwards.
You should be making two large circles, with the ends of each poi traveling in opposite directions and passing each other at the top and bottom of the circles.
Once you’ve mastered the motion, reverse the motion, using the same technique so that the right poi is spinning backwards while the left poi is spinning forwards., This is the fourth of the four basic poi modes. The goal is have one one poi traveling in a forwards (clockwise) circular motion while the other travels in a backwards (counterclockwise) circular motion, with the ends of both poi passing each other at 90 degrees and 270 degrees.


Grip your poi in either kite grip or three-finger over-and-under grip, whichever is more comfortable.
Face forward with your hands at your sides. The poi should be hanging straight down on either side of your body.
Spin the right poi forwards, making a circular motion.
When the end of the right hand poi reaches 90 degrees, being spinning the left poi backwards in a circular motion.
This will look and feel differently than split time mode. With split time opposites mode, the ends of the poi will be traveling in opposite directions and passing each other at 90 and 270 degrees.
Once you’ve mastered the motion, reverse the motion, using the same technique so that the right poi is spinning backwards while the left poi is spinning forwards., Nearly all intermediate and advanced poi moves derive from the four basic modes. As you practice the modes and mix them together you’ll naturally start finding interesting ways to dance with your poi.

, More advanced poi moves will be difficult to learn from words alone. Seek out online videos or a local fire dancer to help you learn more difficult moves.

, You’ll need kevlar poi for this step. You’ll also need kerosene.


Pour the kerosene into a bowl or other container. One measuring cup of kerosene should be more than enough.
Slowly dip the kevlar wicks of your poi into the kerosene, one by one. Let the excess kerosene drip back into the bowl.
Once the kevlar is soaked but not dripping, carefully light the ends on fire with a match or lighter.
Spinning with your fire poi will feel strange at first since the flame creates additional resistance. "

Practice the rotor.,
Practice the forward figure eight.,
Learn intermediate and advanced fire staff moves.,
Light your staff on fire when you are fully comfortable with the moves.",How to Become a Fire Dancer3," This is the most basic staff move where you turn the staff in a large circle in front of your body.


Hold the staff in front of you with your hands face down and gripping the staff in the middle. You arms should be fully extended and the staff should be perpendicular with the ground.
Release your left hand from the staff.
With your right hand, turn the staff in a clockwise circle until you’ve reached 180 degrees. You should maintain your grip during this part of the turn and let your wrist move with the motion of the staff. At 180 degrees, your right hand should be palm up with the staff with the staff perpendicular to the ground.
In a fluid motion, release your full grip on the staff and allow it continue moving in a clockwise direction until it reaches 270 degrees. Maintain a loose grip on the staff with only your thumb and index finger, keeping your palm up. At this point the staff should be vertical with the ground.
Still in a fluid motion, reach down with your left hand, palm facing up, and grip the staff in the same thumb-index-finger grip. Let go with your right hand and let the staff’s momentum carry the staff to 360 degrees.
At 360 degrees, grip the staff fully with your left hand and spin it back to 540 degrees and the starting position.
At 540 degrees, place your right hand back on the staff in the starting position.
Once you’ve mastered the motion, reverse it, using the same technique but moving the staff in a counterclockwise direction. , This is the quintessential staff move where the staff moves in an 8 shape around your body.


Hold the staff in the center with your right hand facing palm down. Your arm should be so that the staff is perpendicular with the ground, with the top end of the staff facing forward.
Maintaining your grip, rotate the staff down across your body so that your right hand ends up on the left side of your body at your waist. The front of the staff should now be facing backwards.
Following the momentum of the staff, let the top end rotate upwards along the left side of your body. When the staff passes the vertical and becomes perpendicular with the ground again, your hand should be facing palm up.
When the staff becomes perpendicular, bring it down and back across your body to the right. The front of the staff should be facing backwards.
Follow the momentum of the staff and let the top rotate back through a vertical position and down to the starting point.
Using the same technique, practice the forward figure eight with your left hand.If the figure eight motion feels difficult, try performing the motion without holding the staff.

, More advanced moves will be difficult to learn from words alone. Seek out online videos or a local fire dancer to help you learn more difficult moves.

, You’ll need kevlar poi for this step. You’ll also need kerosene.


Pour the kerosene into a bowl or other container. One measuring cup of kerosene should be more than enough.
Slowly dip the kevlar wicks of your poi into the kerosene, one by one. Let the excess kerosene drip back into the bowl.
Once the kevlar is soaked but not dripping, carefully light the ends on fire with a match or lighter.

Trust Your Teacher.,
Don't Expect That Every Feis Will Yield A First.,
Be Patient.,
Practice!,
Attend Classes At Least Twice A Week.,
Practice The Execution of Your Steps.,
Set Goals For Yourself.,
Make Friends At Classes.,
Help The Younger Dancers.",How to Become an Irish Dance Champion," Many dancers get so caught up in the grand scheme of things, that they forget their teachers really know what they're talking about. Make sure to listen carefully when your teacher gives you instruction on things you need to improve/work on. Your teacher is certified (TCRG), and likely has many experience dancing themselves. For example, if your teacher says your kicks need to be higher, you need to work on your kicks.;
, Some dancers (and sometimes even parents) have the expectation that every feis will yield a first. Very rarely does a dancer go through many feiseanna without getting anything but firsts, but just remember to keep a positive attitude and that it is only one judges' view of your dancing. The next feis may yield more good fortune!

, This is very important. Make sure to attend a lot of feisanna. It takes a lot time to win firsts and move up through the levels!

, This is the single most important thing you can do. Even on days when you don't have class, go through your step(s) at least twice to stay in shape. This will improve overall technique, coordination, and will relieve some of the stress that comes with prepping for a competition.

, If your school doesn't offer two classes a week (and very few don't), you may want to consider another school that does. The classes need to be at least 2 hours long to build up your stamina and endurance. Your teacher should be pushing and motivating you in class. While no one likes to be yelled at or corrected, the alternative is a teacher who thinks you look great, when they know that you'll never get a first dancing like that.

, Even if you think that your steps are not the greatest, practicing your technique is really important. Remember, the judges are not judging on your ability to memorize choreography, but they are looking at turnout, height in jumps, etc. If your execution is great, odds are you'll place great too. Remember to never be sloppy, for a sloppy dancer can ruin even the nicest choreography.

, Try to stay away from general ones (ex: I want to reach Preliminary Championship level) and focus on the more specific ones like: I want to place in my hornpipe for that feis in a couple of months. Then set up a strategy for achieving that goal, including how much you need to practice, how many days a week, etc. Although you may be tempted to stray to the big dreams (and who hasn't been guilty of daydreaming every now and then), those big dreams won't happen unless you focus on the more specific goals.

, School spirit will always motivate you and dance friends are some of the greatest things you can have. It's always nice to have someone else cheering you on besides your parents, and dance friends can be great for support. Wear your dance school gear (i.e. t-shirts, sweatshirts, etc) to school and other places, and have dance friends sleepovers and parties. It's always nice to have friends who share these major lifetime experiences with you.

, If you are a teenager, help the little ones in class. Younger children always look up in awe to teenagers, and helping them will only help you in the end. It's hard to tell others to cross and turnout your feet and then not do it yourself.(You can do this even if you're a beginner yourself).

It’s a free video hosting platform that’s easy to join by simply following the prompts. You don’t have to audition or enroll in any formal schooling to upload your performances. If a video goes viral and you build a significant following, you may be able to create a portfolio, be approached for music videos, asked to audition for commercials, or get discovered by a talent agency.Create other free social media accounts to build your name. For example, you can promote your Youtube videos by sharing the link on a free account on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. Take advantage of these free platforms and post as often as you can to expose your talent to as broad of an audience as you can.
Consistency is key to gaining a significant following so post regularly and with frequency. Create a schedule that’s easy for you to meet so your fans know when to check your accounts for new content.;
, Post on the walls of famous dancers’ social media profiles. For example, you can comment on a tweet or youtube video a famous dancer posted. You can also partake in dance forums or post on the pages of national or even local dance projects. Becoming a respected voice in the dance community can lead to online fame.You may also learn to shoot, edit, and share videos so people see what you look like and get a sense of your own talent. Think of every post as an audition. Don’t post anything disrespectful or unrepresentative of you as a person and dancer.

, You may have to travel very far to audition depending on where you are living. Your expenses may include airfare, food, and your hotel stay. Save responsibly to make sure that your audition fund is never short. An audition may be a process of several days or even several weeks so be prepared to have the funds on hand.Fame may not come immediately so be prepared to have another source of income that supplements your dance career. Create a monthly budget to ensure you have enough money until your dance career takes off.

, Learn as many styles as you can from as many famous teachers as you can. Famous teaches often tour or have a residency for workshops and classes. Your opportunity may arise from anywhere but getting to know famous teachers at famous studios may help expedite the process. You may also learn your own style from learning the different philosophies of different instructors.You want teachers who have cachet so that their letters of reference or name alone can immediately open doors within the industry. You also want to learn different styles because it may lead you to fame via a different route. For example, if you want to be a famous ballerina and learn hip hop dance, you may become famous for dancing in a hip hop video rather than in a ballet.
Narrow your search for teachers depending on the time and money you have to spend. Some famous teachers may be across the globe. There is no guarantee that studying under someone famous will lead to fame.

, You may be capable of doing things other dancers can't. If you are flexible, athletic, and creative, find a signature dance move. There are many dances, like the twist, that become cultural phenomenon. Work with singers or other artists to spread your move.

, Whether it's a competition at your city, a national competition, or a tv show like ""So You Think You Can Dance"", there will be instant fame if you are one of the top finishers. In particular, winning a televised competition may give you an agent or a key role in a production as part of your winnings.

, In the beginning, find a dance company or school that offers a suitable program. You want an opportunity to advance technically and network professionally. If you are in school, summer is the best time to focus on your dance career with an intensive program.Some programs are very competitive so be sure to allow yourself at least a six months to a year for preparation.

, There may be local, state, federal, or even national funding for specific dance programs that you are applying to. Reach out to funding bodies, like schools or your local arts council, to help fund your initial foray into the industry.Career planning conferences can help you find funding. Workshops can also be a good resource to meet people and learn about any funding opportunities.

, Mentors and internships are a great way to get experience. It also allows you to learn from a number of voices within the industry. Even if internships with a dance company is not advertised, attending performances allows you to approach dancers and build a rapport that you can later turn into a mentor type relationship.Internships and mentorships are highly sought after so be prepared to sacrifice without getting any compensation other than experience. Make sure to find the right person as some may see it as an opportunity to exploit you.

, Learn to present yourself in the best light. In the beginning you’ll need to pitch yourself to get gigs, apply into programs, or to get an agent. Let people know why you deserve an opportunity.You will also need a great profile for social media, to hand out during networking events, or for agents making a surprise visit to a performance.

, Whether you complete a full degree or just a single course, you can always learn and improve your performance. You can learn about kinesiology to help keep your body healthy, music theory to help choreography, or acting and voice lessons for television.There are also a multitude of elements for stagecraft you can learn. Understanding the business may also benefit your financial goals as well.
Different institutions may offer different certificates or degrees so contact the institution and talk to a counselor before committing yourself. For example, rather than investing your resources in a marketing degree, you may just want to take courses in social media to help sustain your profile and build your brand with monthly content., Dance and show business are very competitive. Once you find people who support, listen, and understand you as a person, work to maintain those relationships. You will most likely work in a number of projects throughout your career so be respectful of those you work with as you may work with them again., While your mind may sharpen, your body will slow down as you age. Transition into teaching, acting, singing, or another passion that still allows you to use your knowledge of dance and fame. Don't try to force your body to continue dancing if you suffer from an injury or chronic pain.

, When you start your career you may be eligible for scholarships, apprenticeships, or fellowships. When you become more established you may be able to pay it forward and establish your own scholarship or fellowship. You may become part of national or local organizations that help fend emerging talent. Part of your legacy is what you pass on to the next generation.Make sure to apply early and double check that you meet all the application criteria when applying for a scholarship, apprenticeship, or fellowship. Think about what you needed when you started out before creating you own scholarship. The criteria can be anything that you think needs your attention. For example, you may start a fund for dancers with special needs because your sister also has special needs.

, Keep your focus and continue to dance as much as your body and schedule allow. Your longevity is a direct result of your work ethic. Keeping disciplined and setting new goals will keep things fresh. Immerse yourself in your artistic community to keep inspired by new projects and artists., As you continue your dance career, your body may no longer be able to keep up with the rigors of dancing. Choreography is a natural transition. Collaborate with artists, musicians, actors, and designers to create your own passion projects.Deal with different personalities respectfully. You can always learn from others in different fields. Don’t let your ego get in the way of putting something together.

, Your feet are your main tool for dancing so take extra care of them. Some common problems are blisters, bunions, toe splits, broken bones, and floor burn. Don’t neglect your feet and take the proper precautions. Allow any wounds to heal with the right amount of rest or your feet will sustain permanent damage and end your career prematurely., A poor diet, such as candy and fast food, can make you lethargic and affect your performance. Healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can give you energy and keep your body performing at its peak. Find the right foods to benefit your short term performance and long term health.Energize your morning and get fuel for the day with protein. Snack on hummus, nuts, granola, quinoa, and fruit rather than candy or chips to keep you energized. Have a salad if you are feeling hungry in the evening. It’s also smart to eat food with anti-inflammatory agents like turmeric or ginger., In the beginning, you will need to sacrifice a lot of your time and energy to become famous; however, even when you become famous, you will still need to make sacrifices to ensure you stay relevant. You will need a lot of time to train and recover. Taking care of your mind and body should take precedence over your social time if you want to have a long career.You will need to not only train on your off time but also cross-train, sleep, warm up, cool down, and roll out your muscles and stretch. This is to ensure your body is at its peak physical shape. Don’t compromise your career with an injury that can be easily prevented. There are always new techniques, supplements, and medical advancements to stay on top of., There are many different dance styles. In your off time, learn new forms or improve current styles with a new teacher. Don’t spread yourself too thin. You may only want to focus on a single technique for a specific performance or learn an entire new form as you wait for another gig.Dance is constantly evolving with new sub-genres. You can learn ballet, hip hop, jazz, swing, flamenco, African, modern, interpretive, and all the sub genres in between.

, Other forms of movement can greatly benefit your dance techniques. Train in martial arts, yoga, gymnastics, or other athletic forms to help your coordination, strength, and agility. Muscle movements easily translate into dance choreography., Don’t wait for auditions. Create your own opportunities by collaborating with other artists or funding your own projects. You can even post on community bulletin boards to create local, smaller productions. If you can’t find what you’re looking for where you live, create it.Take advantage of social media and market your performances. You can also reach out to peers and contemporaries to start a new project or find out if they are working on anything that you can be a part of.

, Becoming a famous dancer is extremely difficult even if you have the talent and natural ability. Hard work can be derailed without the proper mindset. Prepare yourself for the injuries, long hours, and emotions needed to beat the odds.Put in extra hours. If you are indispensable, you can ensure a long career. Long hours of work and the right demeanor can endear you to both cast and crew. You can also learn more things beyond the day’s production material.Don’t disrupt practice, class, or a performance with a negative attitude. If you are tired or grumpy, fall back on your support system and don’t take it out on others.

, Have humility and learn from your mistakes and failures. Experience is the best teacher and not every performance will be perfect; some may even be terrible. Take these opportunities to learn, improve, and build your character.Be positive. Focus only on what you can control as anxiety about your future or depression about past failures can become toxic. Your future is bright as long as you continue to work hard, be humble, and respect the process. The physical demands of your career will be difficult to deal with on their own so don’t allow a bad attitude to make things even worse.Be open. Watch any performance and participate in discussions and workshops. You can also supplement your experience by reading articles and meeting people. While stage time is the best teacher, you can also learn from peers and friends that have a different perspective.Everyone makes mistakes and failure will happen. Find the lesson and keep pushing forward after things don’t go as you would have liked.

, Find a lesson in the experience of working with difficult people. Even the best dancers aren’t perfect. You can learn from anything especially your most difficult situations.Dance every opportunity as if it’s your last. You career can be cut short from anything including going bankrupt, falling ill, getting injured, or falling in love. Express your passion with each performance. It doesn’t matter who your audience is as long as you embody your passion for dance.You never know who is watching. A passionate performance can garner you an agent or new career opportunity. If you post it online, it could become viral and increase your fame.

, People in the public eye expose themselves to criticism. Remember that everyone has their own opinion and that you won’t be able to please everyone. You may even find critics among family, friends, peers, and the media. Do what you feel is right and block out the noise.At the end of the day, if you can tell yourself that you’ve given 100%, the reviews don’t matter. You are doing this for yourself and not for anyone else. While fame may be a product of good reviews, you can also become famous for a number of different reasons.
Don’t get involved in drama or politics. As you begin to climb the ranks of fame, you may encounter both toxic individuals and situations. Focus on yourself and avoid anyone who is trying to use you or bring you down. Work on your craft and remain focused on what makes you happiest., Fame and fortune are fleeting. It takes a lot of sacrifice to reach the upper echelon of this very competitive industry. As you become more famous, stay grounded and remember that there’s more to life than fame and dancing., Confidence comes with practice. All the best dancers have put in numerous hours of work to get to their level. Push yourself to improve through the long hours. You may need a lot of travel and do a lot of press. Find time to continue to practice despite a busy schedule filled with media obligations.Stay in the moment. There’s no point in dwelling on mistakes during a poor performance or missed opportunities. It’s easy to get distracted and repeat the same mistake during the performance if you dwell on it. Fall back on the fundamentals of technique and treat each performance as its own."

Dance is silent poetry... contemporary dance is a fusion of poetry and freedom, but also a fusion of past and present.,
Ballet is a first step.,
And all these are ""parallel"" activities along the essence of our story.,
Take good care of you.,
Work with your body.,
Eat well and hydrate your self.,
Dance is art, and not gymnastics.,
Your body is your canvas.,
There are various professional dance academies which focus on contemporary dance.,
Listen to your heart and create your own personal pathway.",How to Become a Professional Modern Dancer," This means you need classical education, ballet. Ballet is a difficult and kind of superior art form. It helps you to strengthen your body, develop your clarity in movement and build strong technique. But you don't want to be a ballet dancer,so...;
, After, there are many different art forms that may help supplement you. Martial arts, as strange as it seems, can offer you a lot; Aikido helps a lot in finding your center and developing your sense of spiral in movement, kung fu is strong and helps you develop stamina, capoeira provides you ways to develop acrobatic movements. Contemporary dance hops so much from these martial arts, that one could build a strong body and a fluent contemporary vocabulary just by doing yoga or kung fu or tai chi.

, Contemporary dancer means taking contemporary classes. Limon, release, flying low, or the more ""academic"" ones, graham and Cunningham. Improvisation is a necessity. Contemporary dance has to do with your personality and how you develop it, how you express it, how you expose it. So you may feel good by taking ballet classes and a contemporary - release classes. Or you may feel good by doing kung fu classes and release classes. Or you may be taking yoga classes, contemporary classes and improvisation. You have to dive and feel what suits you more, what speaks to your heart. Observe dance performances and try to find what seems familiar to you. By this guideline you choose how to build your contemporary dancer.

, Stretch a lot, eat well, keep your self healthy and strong. Dance is a hard core sport.

, Pilates, yoga, any type of bodywork that helps you and suits you better, just do it. A strong body means less possibilities for injury and a long long term ""career"" in dance.

, No reason for eating disorders.

, Please never forget this. Isadora Duncan appeared at times where dance meant ballet. She danced bare foot, just enjoying music and feeling free. She is considered to be one of the pioneers of modern dance.If you want to be a contemporary dancer, this means you seek movement within its essence, beyond form and structure. Picasso drew strange people and images, unrealistic and beyond beauty as we generally understand it . But when we see Guernica, we just feel, as if all the pain has been nourished within this painting and its' black and white ""beasts"" that fill the canvas.

, Your soul is your drawing ""hand"". All that you learn are your colors. The issue is what you visualize to draw on your canvas, what you wish to speak of, as you move.

, The best? PARTS, Seeds, the Place, and there are always others.

, To become a dance artist, a mover who ""flies"" on ground his or her soul to share it with our big big and sometimes small small, beautiful and some times ugly, fair and some times unfair..... our shared world.

These classes are lead by trained instructors are a good place for beginnersMany gyms do offer some dance classes. You'll frequently find Zumba or Barre classes at gyms or fitness centers. However, some community centers or gyms may offer a larger variety.
These classes are usually a part of your gym membership. The classes are not an extra cost and you can go as often as you'd like.;
, If you do not have a gym membership or a fitness center that offers exercise dance classes, you may want to consider using a dance DVD at home. They're convenient and allow you to exercise anytime of day.


You can find a huge selection of DVD's that offer many different types and styles of aerobic dancing. Read reviews of the DVD's so you get a good idea of what's included.
Look for DVD's that offer a video just on basic moves and instructions. Many dance moves can be hard to get down if you haven't done them before. Watching it in slow motion and having someone walk you through it will be beneficial.
There are even some apps that you can download to your smart phone or tablet that allow you to watch exercise videos anywhere. These are great if you're on the go or do not have a DVD player., Outside of the gym or at home dancing DVD's you may even enjoy going out dancing. Whether it's a club, restaurant or dance studio, you may have more fun showing off your moves in public.


If you find that you're really enjoying dancing not just as a workout, but as a fun social event, consider finding local clubs or bars that offer dancing. You can go with friends, family or a spouse and enjoy spending the night dancing.
Even though you may not be wearing your tennis shoes, a night of dancing is still a great workout and will fit well into your fitness routine.
Typical types of dancing you'll find out of the gym include: salsa dancing, ballroom dancing, line dancing and hip hop.

, Zumba is a popular latin-inspired dance class. It's offered at a wide variety of gyms and fitness centers. It's great for all fitness levels and dance abilities.Since Zumba has become so popular, it should be fairly easy to find a class near you. Most gyms offer a Zumba class, but there are also online videos and DVDs you can purchase as well.
Zumba is great for those who don't feel comfortable dancing. During each song you start with one move and then continuously add on to the initial move. You learn through repetition in this particular class.
Make sure you wear comfortable clothing that allows you to have a full range of motion in your arms and legs. Also bring a water bottle to sip on. Most instructors will allow you to have a 30-60 second break between songs., A newer dance class that has arrived on the fitness scene is ballet or barre classes (which are ballet-inspired dance classes). Look for a local barre or ballet studio to find classes.


Ballet and barre classes focus on small movements that help strengthen and tone your muscles. This is a great combination to get a cardio and strength workout.Barre and ballet classes are perfect for anyone regardless of size, age or fitness level. It's even great for those with joint problems or women who are pregnant since its a low impact exercise.For ballet and barre classes, wear fitted clothing. Baggy clothing can inhibit your movements. No-skid socks or ballet flats are appropriate foot wear for these classes.

, If you want to learn a specific dance style and workout, consider taking dance lessons. Whether you're doing the waltz or the samba, dance lessons are a great form of exercise.


Look online for a local dance studio, dance lessons at a community center or even look into private dance lessons where you can learn your desired style of dance.
There are no specific clothing requirements for ballroom or latin-inspired dancing - just something that's comfortable for you. However, you should have shoes that have a slippery bottom and do not have tread. This allows your foot to slide through the positions more easily.Don't avoid dance lessons if you don't have a partner. Many group lessons include many people who just want to learn to dance and do not have a partner. Don't let this discourage you from trying.

, If you're looking for an upbeat and modern form of dance, consider trying hip hop classes. Some gym classes encompass parts of hip hop moves (like Zumba classes), but if this is something you enjoy, consider taking a hip hop class.


Hip hop dance encompasses many freestyle movements in addition to popular moves commonly featured in music videos. It may seem a little complicated, but it allows students to put their own spin on it.Any type of comfortable clothing is appropriate for a hip hop class. You can wear something more fitted or a little looser and baggy. Wear tennis or athletic sneaks with cushioning for this class as well.Bring water and a small towel as you might get more sweaty than you think when taking a hip hop dance class.

, If you want to try a fun and exciting method of dancing, consider taking belly dancing lessons. These are great for anyone regardless of their age, size or fitness level.Belly dancing is a great core workout. It will help strengthen your core by having you exert a lot of control over your pelvic region, core and back muscles. This type of dancing also helps tone your glutes and thighs.There is no specific clothing required for belly dancing. Some people do wear cropped tops, but if you're not comfortable wearing that type of outfit you do not have to. In addition, shoes are generally not worn during the actual dance lessons.
Belly dancing lessons may be difficult to find. Look online for a dance studio that offers them or look for private lessons.

, Like every type of workout or exercise, it's important to wear the correct type of clothing. This will make sure you're the most comfortable during your dance class or lesson.


In general, you should wear an outfit that is movable and doesn't restrict you in anyway. You should be able to easily move your arms and legs in any direction.Also wear clothing that wicks sweat away - especially to more fast-paced dancing (like Zumba or salsa dancing).Many dance classes at gyms will be in an aerobic room that may heat up quickly and stay hot.
Wear comfortable and supportive shoes. For many gym-based classes you want to wear a supportive tennis sneaker. Other forms of dancing like ballet, may require no shoes or specialty shoes which you will need to purchase.
Since there are a variety of types of dancing, research or call the dance studio. Try to find out what's appropriate for the specific type of dance class you'll be attending.

, Like many different types of exercise, make sure to stretch before and after. For dancing specifically, do a light stretch before and a longer stretch afterwards.Dancing requires a lot of movement from all different parts of your body. If you start a dance class with ""cold muscles"" you may not be as limber and may increase your risk of injury.
Do light stretching of your neck, arms, legs and back prior to starting your dance class. You may even want to do some shoulder rolls or head rolls to get you limber.
After you've completed your dancing session, spend more time stretching each major muscle group thoroughly. Focus on your calves, hamstrings, quadriceps, back, shoulders and arms.

, Doing a new dance class or taking dance lessons can be intimidating. Consider going with a friend or family member instead of by yourself.


Studies have shown that if you go to a workout with a friend or family member, you're more likely to stick with your routine and not miss a workout.In addition, other studies have shown that working out with a friend helps you build confidence in yourself and help you believe that you can accomplish a workout.Ask co-workers, friends, family members or your significant other if they'd like to go dancing with you or take a dance class.

, Dance classes can be difficult and tricky to get down when you get started. Be patient with yourself as you learn new moves and incorporate this fun method of exercising into your routine.


When you first start a new dance style, you may notice its hard to memorize all the moves and move fluidly through all the poses. That's normal and to be expected so don't quit or beat yourself up over it.
The more you practice the moves, the easier they'll become. You won't have to think so hard about where you put your feet.
Remember, when you're dancing try to keep it light and fun. Don't worry about making mistakes or not knowing the moves. It's just about getting out there an enjoying your workout.

, Dancing can be a great form of cardiovascular or aerobic exercise. However, make sure that you're including enough dance classes or other forms of exercise to meet your weekly needs for activity.


Health professionals recommend that healthy adults strive to get a minimum of 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardiovascular activity each week.You should aim to make these activities moderate intensity. That means you're working hard enough to break a sweat and should be sightly out of breath.Other activities outside of dancing that can count towards your aerobic goal are: walking, jogging, swimming, using the elliptical or taking a spin class.

, In addition to all of your dancing and other aerobic activities, include regular amounts of strength training as well.


Strength training is important to do in addition to cardio because it offers a different set of health benefits. Strength training activities help strengthen your bones, build and maintain lean muscle mass and increase your metabolism.Health professionals recommend including at least 1 or 2 days of strength training activities each week. You need to work every major muscle group and be working out for a minimum of 20 minutes.
Most dancing doesn't count as strength training. However, activities like lifting weights, using weight machines, pilates or yoga do count.

, In addition to your aerobic dancing and strength training, also try to include some lifestyle activity. These activities can also help keep you active and support a healthy lifestyle.


Lifestyle activities are those you do on a typical daily basis. Anything from walking out to get the mail, vacuuming the floor, weeding the garden or parking far away count as lifestyle activities.
Although these types of activities do no burn many calories by themselves, a whole day of them can add up to quite a bit. Plus, they come with similar benefits to structured cardiovascular activities.
In addition to your dancing classes, try to be more active throughout the day. Think of when you could take more steps or move more throughout the day. Even a little dance session on your lunch break in your office gets you moving more!

Pretend as if nothing has happened.",How to Organize a Flash Mob," A flash mob is about performance and it usually centers around entertainment, causing amusing (harmless) confusion, or satirizing something that members of the audience will immediately understand and respond to.It is about spontaneity, engaging observers in a spectacle which expects nothing from them apart from enjoying what they're witnessing. Some things that a flash mob is not:


A flash mob is not appropriate as a marketing vehicle for a product or service (despite several attempts at this), political purposes or a publicity stunt. The reason is that these do not carry the element of entertainment or satire without strings attached for the observers. These sorts of events have their motive as an expectation that observers will then do something like buy a product, vote for someone or support a particular cause.
A flash mob is not an excuse for violence or damaging property. To participate in something that results in this is to be part of a rioting mob or crowd, not a flash mob. Never have the intent to create a violent or harmful event from a flash mob exercise. (Public authorities in some places have taken to naming crime sprees as ""flash mobs,"" but criminal behavior has nothing to do with flash mobs as performance art.)

, The success of a flash mob event is dependent on the originality, liveliness, and attractiveness of the event. Avoid copying a flash mob event that has been performed somewhere else. Always make alterations to any flash mob performance that has inspired you so that it has your own mark of originality and local relevance. In all cases, the performance must be worked out in advance and either rehearsed or well explained in some manner (such as through online instructions) so that everyone knows their role and interactions with the other performers. The most typical flash mob performances involve such activities as:



Choreographed dance: an example would be a large group all performing a dance in the park to support a lover proposing to his girlfriend.
Singing something such as opera, yodeling, or a pop hit. Any style of singing is fine, but make sure it's interesting. An example would be breaking into song about the wonders of fruits and vegetables while in the supermarket.
Acting out a particular scenario: such as lots of people walking invisible dogs on leashes.

Mime: An example would be pretending to try to find a way through a wall that isn't there.
Using an existing joyful event to spread love: An example would a wedding, graduation or anniversary celebration being taken to a street, mall or other public place to spread the joy!

World Record: Trying to break a Guinness World Record by having the largest gathering doing ""X"" at the same time.

Freeze Flash Mob: All members become living statues and freeze.

, There is quite a collection available to watch and this will provide an excellent source of inspiration. It will also as give you ideas about how to handle your group of people and have the performance come together. Like all performance, timing and execution are critical to the success of a flash mob.

, You'll need willing performers to participate in the flash mob and for that, you can make good use of online resources. Use social media networks, emails, texting and websites to find people for your flash mob. You may also be able to draw on the resources of a class you're in, a performance or dance group you're a part of, or other groups of people you spend time with. Ask your friends and family if they'd like to be a part of it too.


Use Facebook, Twitter, and websites to bring people together. People will be searching for a flash mob with the words ""flash mob"" or ""flash mob"" so be sure to include these in any message you're creating to find people.
Improv Everywhere is based in New York City and while not all of its street performances are flash mobs, some are and you might be able to participate with them if you're located in NYC. Check out their website for more information.
There are many local flash mob websites; just use a search engine to find them using your location name and the term ""flash mob"".

, The success of your flash mob event will require your participants to know exactly what to do. It is best if you can have a rehearsal beforehand, but if this isn't possible, then at least provide very clear instructions (either online or by email, etc.) as to what to wear, where to be at what time, what to do (for example: Be prepared to freeze, walk, dance, gape like a fish, etc, on the corner of 55th street and 3rd avenue at 7am), and how long to do the act for. If any participants need to interact together, it's best if they rehearse this for the sake of timing and accuracy.


If the instructions are simple, such as everyone stand in one place reading a newspaper they've cut eye holes in, then the simplicity of the action will probably mean you don't need to rehearse. However, it's a very good idea for everyone participating to try to meet up somewhere prior to the event to quickly run over the details, what's expected of the event and participants, and what to do when it's over. It's also helpful to explain what to do if people get annoyed or the police try to shift the group.
If the instructions are complex, especially where scenes need to be choreographed and organized, then consider having a smaller group of people you are certain can turn up to rehearsals and keep fairly quiet about the event, rather than having a much larger and harder to coordinate group. About 50 people can be organized fairly successfully, but higher numbers mean that things start getting trickier.
It can be easier to coordinate a dance group you're already involved in. For example, getting a group of your Zumba practitioners from the local gym to perform in the street together might be a great chance for the participants to show off what they've learned already.

, It's best to ask the participants to bring their own props or to organize their own costume gear (such as evening wear, swimsuits, wigs, whatever) but sometimes you'll need to provide things for everyone (such as dog leashes a collar for an invisible dog walk).


If the props or costumes are difficult for people to find or make on their own, consider holding a workshop beforehand in which everyone has the opportunity to create the items needed. However, you should aim for simple clothes and items, or things that people already have in their wardrobe or house.

, Do a proper check of the area you're proposing to perform the flash mob in. There may be safety, legal, or physical limits on what can be done in the location. To avoid getting into trouble legally, it's important to not create unsafe obstructions, safety problems, or to hold up people in ways that prevent them from their usual business on non-public premises. While there is obviously a balance between encouraging people to watch and blocking people from getting on with their usual activities, you need to judge that your flash mob won't be the cause of emergency or unlawful situations. For example, if your flash mob would be likely to block emergency exits, then think again about where to locate the event.


As mentioned above, tell your participants what to do in the event that the police or some other authority requests that your group leave. The best option is to do as asked quietly and peacefully. In any case, a well-run, legitimate flash mob will be over and done with before these people even arrive.

, It's definitely worth having the whole event filmed so that you can upload it to YouTube. Who knows? It might even go viral! If nothing else, it will serve as inspiration for other flash mobs into the future.

, trust that the flash mob will go according to plan! As the organizer, you remain responsible for ensuring that the flash mob sticks to the plan and doesn't create problems for the public at the event.

, Once the flash mob event is over, don't allow the participants to sit around and talk or to start talking to the crowd. They need to mingle back with the crowd and head off into the sunset as if nothing ever took place.

, Do you want it to be something up-tempo or more mellow? Do you want something well known or something that displays a certain style of music, such as opera?;
, If this is you, great. If not, get someone who knows how to help turn a group dance into something spectacular.

, A park in a major city is a great spot, especially during lunch hour or after work when everyone is heading home.

, Flash mob dances can be any number of people but try to aim for at least 50-75. It may sound like a lot to arrange but the more people you have, the more effective the flash mob dance becomes.

, This way you don't have to get too many people in the same room or area at once and they can also entertain the crowd from different perspectives. This is good for people who can't see the whole scene in front of them.

, This will be the best dancer in the group, the person who sets the beat and provides a following point for the remaining dancers. The leader can start the routine with a solo dance move, then attract the next group of 9 to 15 dancers who join in with the next move. Then, double the group's size with 16 to 30 dancers joining in. The trick to a good flash mob is to gradually get all of the dancers involved in the routine. Get the rest of them to join in in the last part of the song so that the entire group is finally involved.

, As soon as the song has finished, the dancers must disperse as normal members of the crowd to act as if nothing has happened.

Choose a song that can be recognised.,
Practice your song.,
Wear something eye-catching.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Be yourself.",How to Sing to Win in a Talent Show," Choose a song that is catchy and will be remembered because you rocked it! If the song is popular, the audience will want to sing along too. Everyone will have a good time, making you very memorable.;
, Now that you've chosen a song, you need to practice it. Learn all the lyrics off by heart. This will save you the embarrassment of having to carry the lyrics on stage with you. Once you know all the lyrics (that shouldn't take long if you already know the song), practice singing them in time with a backing track. Keep practicing until your voice gets really good.

, Choose an outfit that suits and means something to you. The outfit could be bright and modern or maybe it is an outfit that is old-fashioned. As long as you look nice and are comfortable, you should be alright. You might want to take extra care to look smart rather than showing up in jeans and a t-shirt.

, Be smiley and friendly. The judges enjoy someone who they can have a laugh with. The audience will like you better if you have a good relationship with the judges. Remember to respect the judges and the audience. Everybody has their own opinions; if you can’t take the heat then it is time to get out of the kitchen!

, Don't model yourself too much after a certain singer or musician. Also, don't pretend to be someone you're not. People like people who are unique and are confident but not too cocky.

Perform with passion and attitude.",How to Win a Talent Show," Use a unique skill or ability that you already possess and make it appear more impressive. Maybe you have great drumming skills, a stellar singing voice, or the ability to make complicated balloon animals. You can then take your ability to the next level by adding in a surprising or interesting element. Think of creative ways to impress the judges with your talent and show them how well you can do the talent even in less than ideal circumstances.You may want to enlist friends to perform with you and create an act where you all drum together on stage. Or you may ask friends who can play instruments to be your backing band for your singing performance. You can then create synchronized movements as a band that you perform together during the act.
If you have a more specialized talent, like making balloon animals or juggling, you may want to add in an element of difficulty that will appear impressive to the judges. This could be making a huge balloon animal within a certain time limit or making balloon animals while riding a unicycle or running on a treadmill.;
, When you are creating your act, you should showcase your strengths as a performer. This will help you feel more comfortable when you perform and more confident. You will also be at your best when you are catering to your strengths, as this can help to hide your weaknesses as a performer.If you are more comfortable in costume when performing in front of others, come up with a unique costume that ties into your act. Maybe you wear an updated clown costume for your juggling act or a long, glamorous gown for your jazz singing performance with a band. Think about how you can use costume as a way to feel comfortable and confident on stage.
You may be at ease when you move and dance around the stage, as opposed to staying in one place. Integrate this into your act, where you do a coordinated dance with the other people in your act or do a dance to fit your act if you are on stage alone.

, Stage props can be as simple as a microphone stand or as complex as confetti raining down from the rafters of the theater. Think of ways that you can use stage props to enhance your performance. Maybe you use an umbrella in your dancing act to add an element of originality and surprise. Or maybe you integrate the mic stand into your balloon animals act.


Stage props like confetti, balloons, pyrotechnics, and lasers can all be costly and complicated to set up. If you have the budget and the time to integrate these props, do so as long as they fit within in your act and are not simply being used to fill time or space on the stage. Avoid leaning on the props to hide your lack of talent. Your talent should always be at the forefront.

, Audience participation is always a good thing in any performance. Often, appealing to your audience will help to get them on your side and impress the judges. Think of ways to involve the audience. This may mean asking someone from the audience to participate in your act or have the audience snap or clap along to your performance., Appeal to the crowd and the judges by using body language that is engaging and fun to watch. This means making eye contact with the audience, smiling at the audience, and putting your body into your performance. Use expansive gestures and movements if you are doing a dance routine or performing with a band. Demonstrate energy and enthusiasm towards the audience, as this will make the audience feel more engaged during your act., Facial expressions are a key element of performance, especially if you are a singer or a dancer. Practice an open expression by keeping your eyes wide and open as you perform. Lift your eyebrows slightly when you are hitting a high note or holding a dance movement. Keep your mouth relaxed and open. Use your smile at the end of your performance to show the audience you are happy with your performance, and they should be as well., Remember that you are performing for an audience, who will be watching your every move. Be aware of how you appear when you perform by practicing your performance in front of a mirror. This could be a full length mirror in your bedroom or a mirror in a dance studio or practice space., Avoid the performance jitters by doing a dry run of your performance in front of a receptive, friendly audience of family and friends. Set up a mock stage and a few seats in your living room. Try to pretend you are in the auditorium where you will be perform at the talent show and give it your all. You should feel more comfortable and confident performing in front of friends and family., After you perform for family and friends, you should ask them for feedback and listen patiently to what they have to say. They may give you basic feedback, like project your singing voice more, hold a certain note, or make sure you acknowledge the crowd at the end of your act. Take this feedback and use it to improve your act so it is ready for the real talent show.

, Calm any pre-performance nerves by being prepared on the day of the talent show. This means having all your stage props ready, having your costume on hand, and making sure everyone in your band is present for the show. You may want to take time after school to prepare for the show, packing a bag of supplies that you will need for your performance.

, You know what they say, “save the best for last”. Going last in the lineup may help you get a leg up on the competition and help to calm your nerves, especially if you need time to get used to being around the other performers and to being on stage. Going last can also allow you to create a lasting impression on the judges that will be fresh in their minds as they deliberate the winners of the show.

, Take some time to sit in the audience and observe your competition, on the day of the talent show or during rehearsals for the show (if applicable). Notice if there are acts that are similar to your act or that use an element of your act. You may need to adjust your act so your version is more interesting and engaging. To win the show, you really need to focus on standing out from your competition.

, Self-talk is your internal dialogue, which is often running in the background in your mind as you go through your day. Having positive self-talk on the day of the talent show can help you to perform at your best and give you the confidence you need to blow away the judges.Push negative thoughts out of your mind and focus on positive self-talk. This could mean not freaking out when you miss up a step in practice or skip a beat. Instead, tell yourself, “It’s okay, it’s just practice. I have time to get better at this.” You can also use positive self-talk as you perform for the judges. Remind yourself that you worked hard to get to this point and that you are the best performer on the stage. Tell yourself that you have all the skills and abilities to win.

, A big part of performing at your best is putting your passion and attitude up front for the judges and the audience to see. This means not being afraid to get emotional during your performance and being yourself when you perform. Doing this will increase your chances of winning, on your terms."

If there is someone out there smiling or wishing you good luck that's great too! Focusing on a loved one makes me feel more comfortable. While you sing, dance or you hand motions. Even if it's a slow song, it wouldn't be a bad idea to walk around the stage a bit. And most of all, enjoy it! No one wants you to feel pressured or uncomfortable about performing.

Save some tears for later.",How to Cry On the Spot," What we think is what makes us cry. It is something we're often told; in the case of getting emotional, this is definitely valid. Try to think of something that makes you really sad. For example, think back to the loss of a beloved family member, friend or a pet, breakup with girl/boyfriend, attending a funeral, losing something you treasured or how it felt when you missed out on something you'd worked really hard to achieve. This will begin to put you in the right frame of mind for tears.


If you can't or don't want to think of anything from the past, think of someone you care about getting hurt. For some, it's wise never to look back on a sad occasion that actually happened. This could be emotionally dangerous and lead to a spiral of sadness. Instead, think of something that could happen in the future, pretend one of your family members died or was injured, or remember a sad scene from a motion picture.;
, Most people have something that gets the floodgates open automatically and when it comes up, the tears just start flowing. It can be something totally understandable, like the way a parent or authority figure treated you, or something completely surprising with a backstory, like that one incident on the roller coaster a few years ago. Is there a topic that always makes you want to cry, even if it doesn't make much sense?


Imagine as if you are in that moment. However, beware: it's important to be in charge of your emotions afterwards. If the particular incident is a tearjerker, but is particularly traumatic, then it is best to not go down memory lane.

, Many of us have fears that we are or are not a certain way that we try very hard to be or not be. When we're confronted with the idea that we're not how we see ourselves, it gets pretty scary. This can be a good source of tears. What's one way you don't want to think of yourself as? What if you actually were that way?


Once you pinpoint what you, for example, don't want to be (e.g. weak), latch onto it. Let that fear flow out of you in the form of tears. Pretend it's real. How does it feel? Just remember to shake it off afterward!

, For some, crying due to a personal issue isn't doable or isn't safe. However, if you have a particularly vivid imagination, you can construct something equally as sad. It doesn't have to involve anyone you know or love or even yourself. What brings tears to your eyes about the world? For the record, they can be happy, tears, too.


You could trying thinking of something sad like puppies being left on the side of the road. You want to save them all, but you can only take one, if you're lucky. As you're holding the one puppy you got to save, you look at all of the other puppies that aren't being held.
You could try happy things, too, like veterans getting reunited with their families, old couples holding hands after 50 years, or those getting discriminated against rising in the face of adversity. Those can be moving moments, too.

, Block everything from the outside world and completely close yourself off while you're attempting to make yourself cry on the spot. Really dig deep into your emotional self and let it all out, concentrating only on you – not your surroundings, not the situation, just on you. Controlling your thoughts and memories and how much you listen to the outside world (like someone trying to calm you down, for example) will determine how much, how hard and how long you will cry for.


Remember that crying can be therapeutic. It can even cause you to get sleepy, which can be nice when you've had a long day or night.

, Just burying your face in your hands and laughing can work. It can sometimes be hard to tell if someone is laughing or crying if they do it correctly. While your face is in your hands, try to make your eyes a little red by rubbing them hard with your hands in a fist form, otherwise it'll be too obvious. And don't smile when you take your hands away! This works best on a stage, when people are not close enough to see tears or your face in close detail.


Sometimes you can tear up from laughing, so perhaps try thinking of something funny or get a fellow funny actor to crack jokes around you just prior to filming or acting that scene. Make sure you look sad when the tears start flowing, though!
Some people laugh as a nervous or upset response. You may have noticed this in other people. You can mimic this display of emotion if faking crying is very difficult for you.

, A common method for starting tears is to cause your eyes discomfort. Of course, be careful as to how you go about doing this, and be aware that some of these methods can hurt a little (which will probably really make you cry):


Hold your eyelids open with your fingers and stay like this for 2 minutes.
Try to expose your eyes to the air as much as possible. Keep your eyes open as long as you can. Don't close them until tears form under your eyes. Keeping your eyes open will dry them out, making them sting. Don't close your eyes when they start to hurt or no tears will form.
Place your eyes next to a fan - looking into the airflow can make you cry.
Lightly place your pointed finger up to your one of your pupils. This will cause that eye to become irritated, and it may lead to tears. Be careful not to poke your eye out.
Take the top lid of your eye and bring it over your bottom lid. It makes realistic looking tears.

, Close your eyes and rub your eyelids for about 25 seconds. Open them and stare at something until the tears start rolling. You might not get it the first time but it can work wonders. Rubbing can leave your eyes sore but if done gently, it can help redden the complexion around your eye area, too.


Never rub your eyes with something hot like chili, hot pepper powders, curry powder, etc. or you will do more than cry for real; this can not only hurt intensely but may also cause injury to your eye.

, Think about something that really upsets you, and stare. You can also put your hand in your pocket and pinch your thigh. A bit of pain may get the tears to start rolling.


Try holding your nose very tightly so you can't breathe through it. Then concentrate on the bite in your mouth. When air can't flow, it's easier for your senses in your mouth to focus on the pain. Tears might then come.

, Doing things with other parts of your body can help to bring on tears. Some examples include:


Try yawning repeatedly. This may help to make your eyes water (especially if you're feeling a little tired).
Sometimes you can cry by breathing into the back of your throat rather than down your windpipe, this is how yawning can make you cry as well. Or it might just make you yawn!
Try pinching yourself hard in some sensitive parts of your body like the space between your thumb and pointer finger or under your eye and tears will automatically begin to flow down.

, Cutting an unwashed onion is very effective in provoking tears. This method is probably best for plays though – it's a little difficult to bluff crying around someone you want to convince you're crying when you produce an onion and both of you start getting all teary!


If you can escape to another room, grab a few slices of onion, and take a whiff close to your face. Bask in their tear-creating gases, and then come back out.

, Gently rub just a tiny spot of Tiger Balm, mentholated petroleum jelly, or hand sanitizer under your eyes. It may sting, but it's going to be very realistic. However, be careful not to overdo this one and be very careful about not getting any in your eyes.


You can also use eye drops to make it look like your face is tear-stained. Just place them right below the corner of your eyes so they believably run down your face.

, This usually involves closing your eyes and scrunching your face up a little – simply imagine yourself through the motions through remembering what your face feels like when you do actually cry.


Turn the corners of your lips down a little.
Try to force the inner corners of your eyebrows upwards.
Wrinkle up your chin like people do right before they start bawling. This may look fake, so be careful.

, The breathing is part of what convinces people that you're upset. Start sobbing by making crying noises and take deep breaths as you do so. Breathe in constantly as if you are hyperventilating; you can add little hiccuping noises, too.


If nobody can see you, run on the spot for several minutes to cause yourself to be out of breath. If you can do this, it'll help to create the blotchy complexion often associated with crying.

, Once you have the eyes tearing, the crying face and the hyper breathing going, add in a typical crying body stance. Some suggestions include:


Cover your face with your hands and lower your head.
Look away, trying to pretend you're not crying – the double bluff!
Bite your lip, as if you're trying hard to stop the tears. Wobbling your bottom lip really adds to the effect. Just make sure you don't look like you're faking it.
Rest your head on a table or other item in front of you in a gesture of hopelessness or attempt to self-compose.

, When speaking, constrict your vocal cords. Aim to stutter your words and add in long intakes of breath to add to the effect. Make bubbling noises, and ramble on about the thing that has supposedly caused you to feel upset. In general, get emotionally carried away. The trick is to convince yourself that you're actually crying, as well as everyone else.


This is basically ""mind over matter"" and the more you act it out, the more your body will acquiesce to produce the effect you're after.

, If you're going to be in a serious theatrical production, don't worry about having to produce your own tears. A menthol tear stick and menthol tear producers are the tools of the TV drama, film, and theater trade. The stick version requires a sparse application under the eyes. The ""tear producer"" works as a spray. Both produce immediate results.


TV and film actors have the benefit of working with an entire crew of technicians and artists. Although some movie stars utilize some of the professional techniques many actors options for an easier solution.

, Since you're faking this, it won't have authentic emotions to keep fueling your crying. If you do end up making real tears, don't expect to keep making even more tears because your eyes will get tired after a while and won't be able to produce as many tears, especially lacking the emotion that can cause us to cry for a long time when something truly upsetting does happen. Wind it up quickly to give your eyes a break.


And to give your mind a break, too. Crying can be quite exhausting, both physically and mentally. Don't put yourself through more wear than you absolutely have to.

It's also important to know how to communicate with casting agents and directors at film studios. Most communication from behind the scenes to on the stage is in Hindi, making it requirement #1.


While English is used in many Bollywood films, command of English is an optional skill. However, if you're confident in English, too, that is a point in your favor and may mean you get chosen for a part over someone else.;
, Study current actresses in the Bollywood film industry to see what is in demand. Stereotypically, successful actresses have long, slightly wavy hair, olive complexions, and manicured eyebrows, nails, lips, and everything else in between.


Just like in Hollywood, there is a definite emphasis on being beautiful. The majority of actresses are quite stereotypically feminine – they have long hair, clear skin, a thin frame, and gentle features.

, To work in Bollywood films, you not only need to have rhythm and fluid dance moves, but must know the meanings of all the movements and positioning. Hand and body gestures and movements, when done incorrectly, can offend viewers. It's not only something you're born with – it's something you have to learn.


Lessons at a dance school, through online videos or with a private instructor are some options. Though not every role will involve dance, just about every movie does.

, The Bollywood film industry is famous for its dancing and singing segments, and there are normally 6 or more musical numbers in a film. If you want true stardom, your voice will have to be a gem. The earlier you start, the better.


More and more voice teachers are offering lessons over the phone or via Skype. If you don't know of any teachers in your area, consider taking online lessons as an option.

, In addition to song and dance, you've got to be able to act and move with a subtle grace. Study with a mentor, join an acting group, or consider going to film school if your funds allow for it. Sure, you need an ""it"" factor, but you also need the technical know-how.


This involves practice, too. While you are studying, take every opportunity to hone your acting skills. The more time you get in front of the camera, the better. But onstage in front of a live audience is good, too.

, To get a feel of the type of roles, current acting style and dialog delivery of the well-known actors and actresses, it is very important to watch Hindi movies. Immerse yourself in them. Develop a refined appreciation for them to the point where you can't see yourself doing anything else. Make them a part of your life.


There are sources to watch Hindi movies online, like FridayMasti.com that can help widen your Bollywood horizons.
This will help you understand the culture, too. Read about the area and keep up with news and trends to supplement your knowledge as well.

, In order for casting agents to take you seriously, you've got to have a portfolio. Have professional photographs taken and make an audition tape or DVD that shows your acting, singing and dancing skills. It should also show snippets of the work you've already done.


Promote yourself on sites like YouTube, where you can develop your own following independently. If you have your own professional website, even better.

, This could be an extra or walk-on role in a film or a stunt double. Accept parts in commercials, on television shows, reality and game shows. Try to get work as a model, too. You can't start at the top – you've got to work your way up. It's all a step in the right direction.


Film studios are centered around Mumbai's Juhu district. Film scouts looking for extras and tourists are usually most active in the early morning hours.

, It takes just as much charisma, talent and ability to be ""discovered"" in Bollywood as it does in Hollywood. Competition is high and connections are important. Further, it's difficult to work in Bollywood if you are not of Indian descent. Determine whether you actually have a chance to make it before committing a lot of time and energy to learn how to become a Bollywood actress.


While you're working your way up, you'll need a source of income. Many of those aiming for stardom having something else they do on the side until they get their big break. It's good to have a fall back in the case that it doesn't work out.

, Many of the top film stars got their start because they were born into the business. Just like Hollywood, Bollywood is about networking, networking, networking. That invite you got to that party? Go. You never know who you might meet that can give you a leg up.


This is why taking any gig possible, even if it's collecting the mail, is a step in the right direction. You'll be around the right people and get your name and presence known. Even the smallest gig can lead to large opportunities.

, Most of Bollywood is centered in Mumbai. Your odds of making it increase drastically if you can center your life in Mumbai, too, and make it to every audition possible. You'll get more confident with each one as well.


Remember: there is no audition that is too small. Every role is something you can add to your resume or put onto your reel. The beefier it is, the more a casting agent will look at you and think, ""She must know what she's doing.""

, Very few actresses start out being the star. They put in their time and make the effort, proving they have that ""something special."" As you develop your career, you'll start being able to nab bigger and bigger roles. More and more people will recognize you, leading to bigger and better opportunities.


Be patient – this climb up the ladder takes time, and some don't see results for years. Stick with it, believe in yourself, and do your best. You'll inevitably experience rejection, but that can't stop you. Let your confidence carry you through.

, Some actresses struggle their entire lives trying to fit into a box the media or their manager says they should fit into. They try to fit a ""look"" that really just isn't them. Instead of doing this, embrace what makes you different. Take what makes you unique and run with it – because no one else can. No one else can do what you can do, but everyone can try to be the same person.


If there's some way you don't fit in, make it work for you. Is your voice a little different than ""normal?"" No, it's distinguishable – you just need the right role. And in that right role, you'll be unforgettable.

, With more and more positive attention inevitably comes more and more negative attention. You'll be in the public eye, so it's wise to be on your best behavior. You'll have naysayers and people wish you'll fail, but ignore them. You have fans on your side, too. Concentrate on the positive; don't wallow in the negative. It certainly won't do you any favors.


With stardom comes responsibility. You'll be a role model to people the world over, but especially to children. Always step out your door with you best foot forward and behave responsibly.

, All that hard work is finally paying off. You're making movies, you're lounging in VIP rooms, and you're rubbing noses with other stars. Ah, the life. Cherish it, because not everyone is so lucky. Pay it forward to the people that helped you on your way up. They're the ones that are keeping you at the top, too!


Use your stardom to affect your community for good. What organizations do you care about? How can you help those in need? Not only are you a star, but you're an ambassador of global prosperity, too. Take your power and use it for good.

This is a completely legitimate technique and it's worth trying. But in addition to a secret, know your character inside and out. Make them a real person, not just a name on a page.


What do they do in their free time? How do you think they react to certain circumstances? Who are their friends? What makes them happiest? What's their inner dialogue like? What is their overall view on the world? What's their favorite color? Food? Where do they live?
Research everything you can about the character if it’s based on a real person. If not, research the time period the character is supposedly from, where they lived, and the historical events that happened around your character.;
, Knowing what is driving your character will make everything fall into place. Analyze the work as a whole, but get a motivation down scene by scene, part by part. Does your character have a motivation that arches through the entire show? How about for each interaction? The answer is ""yes,"" so what is it?


Generally, this is in the script. If it's not, your director will make that clear with their concept. Take the first scene you're in and analyze what you want and how you will get what you want. You should end up with two things: a simple thing like ""acceptance"" or ""reassurance"" followed by ""getting my friend/lover/enemy to x, x, and x."" Once you have that, emote away.

, In order to be confident when you’re acting and to be able to concentrate on your character, you will have to know your part as well as you can.When you’re nervous, it can often be easy to forget your lines or struggle with them. To avoid being tongue-tied on stage, learn your lines so well you can practically do them in your sleep.


Read through your lines every night. When you’ve gotten the hang of it, start trying to recite the lines to yourself and see how far you can go without glancing at the script.
Practice saying the lines with a friend or family member and have them play the other characters. That way, you’ll also memorize the context of your lines and when you’re supposed to say them.

And if someone else messes up, you'll be able to cover them!


Practice your lines the way that you want to deliver them on stage or in front of the camera. Experiment with different ways to deliver each one to find what works best and feels most authentic.

, Though you may think of it as just a lot of time spent erasing later, writing notes in your script will help you immensely. Develop your own system of annotations that only you can understand.


Write in pauses, or beats. These can be noted with a line between words or phrases. Seeing the line through the phrase gives you a concrete reminder to slow down. Pauses are just as important as words. Remembering that is essential to an effective delivery.
Write in feelings. In one paragraph alone, you may have four different overall motivations. Maybe you start off angry, explode, and then try to rein yourself back in. Write in emotions (or whatever would serve as a reminder) above the sentence to aid you in recalling the best delivery.
Write in your reactions. That's right, you should be making notes on others' lines, too. After all, if you're on stage, there's probably at least one person in the audience looking at you, even if you're not talking. How do you feel about what you're being told? What are you thinking about as you're witnessing the scene from the sidelines? When you figure this out, write it down.
Write in volume cues. There may be a line or lines that need to be said much louder than others or key words you need to really punch. Think of your script like music by writing in crescendos, decrescendos, and accents.

, Take a deep breath. It helps a lot of people if they tense up their entire body and keep it that way for a few seconds. Then, just relax all your muscles. ""Box breathing"" is also a good method. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and then breathe out for 4 seconds. The overall effect will calm you down.

, There are entire techniques and classes dedicated to movement for performers and for good reason. They'll help you utilize your ""space"" to the best of your ability and take command of the stage. Acting is not just in your voice or in your face, but on all planes.


Feel free to give your character quirks. Does he walk with a slight limp from a war? Does she constantly play with her hair? Is he a leg twitcher? Does she pick at her fingernails? It doesn't have to be in the script! Think about how your character would act in daily living. How do you see them sitting in a waiting room? What would they be found doing?

, Talk louder than you usually would so everyone can hear you and the camera can catch the sound. There's nothing more irritating than being in the audience and catching every third word.


Don’t talk absurdly – just make sure that your voice carries and that you are not mumbling or talking in an indoor voice to your fellow actors.
If you’re in a play, you need to make sure that the people in the back of the audience can hear you, so stand up straight, project your voice and make sure you’re turning slightly towards the audience. You don’t want to be speaking to the back wall.
Do not speak too fast. This often garbles your words and makes it difficult to hear what you’re saying.

, When you are on stage or in front of the camera, you have to say your words clearly and make sure all the sounds are well defined. This is especially important at the ends of words, which are easy to swallow and lose acoustically.


Make sure all your consonants are present. This should just slow you down enough to be easily understood by all.
Don’t overdo your enunciation, since this could come across sounding unnatural.You want to make sure your voice sounds clear, but not like you’re overacting. If you are uncertain about whether or not you’re over or under-enunciating your words, ask the director and your fellow actors.

, Even if your character doesn't have an accent, there are still other aspects of their idiolect to consider that may not be in the script. Consider their age, race, social status, beliefs, and income.


In a review of the semi-recently revived ""The Pajama Game,"" one writer said that the main character was great...apart from not being believable. She played a simple Midwestern girl who pronounced ""either"" EYE-thurr. Wrong. Dead giveaway. So close, too. Avoid being that girl and analyze your character's dialogue.

, This really should go without saying. Unfortunately, largely in part due to Keanu Reeves, it doesn't. As an actor, you have to portray certain emotions and make sure that the audience can see what you’re feeling, whether you’re on stage or on camera. Use your own emotions to tune into your character's -- right now, they're one in the same..


Find an emotion within yourself that matches how your character would feel. Did her mom just die? Okay, so thankfully your mom isn't dead, but you remember how it felt when Poodle, your pet goldfish died and that sucked. You cried for days. Channel that. The audience has no idea what's your trigger, they just know that you're devastated and it probably has something to do with the plot line they're entranced it (if only they knew...).
Manipulate the tone of your voice. If your character is upset, you might want your voice to sound harsher and less controlled. If your character is excited or nervous, make your voice go higher.
Use gestures and body language to convey emotions. Don’t just stand there with your hands at your sides. If your character is angry, wave your hands and stomp your feet. If the character is sad, hunch your shoulders and hang your head. Be logical.

, Never, ever, ever, ever, ever give away that you've messed up. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. Was that enough ""evers"" to get the point across? Whether it's in your voice or on your voice, don't let the audience know. If you don't let them know, guess what? They won't.


If you're dancing or moving, don't let your face drop. Confidence is fooling beyond belief. Stay smiling. Smile because you're the only one who knows.
If you've flubbed a line, run with it. The only people who have the script memorized are onstage. Cycle back to where you need to go. If the other actor(s) is/are as professional as you are, there will be no problem.

, From the moment you step onstage, you are not dealing with romantic issues, money problems, or a general fit of fatigue. All that stuff is left offstage. You are only in the moment that is creating itself before you.


If you're going through something during the run of a show, this needs to be an outlet. Theatre should destress you, not add to your plate. Take this moment to be someone else and check your problems (and attitude) at the door. You can pick it up in a few hours if you'd really like. Stop what you're thinking and start listening actively and being present. The audience will know if you're not.

, If you forget everything else, just remember that you have to be your character and not slip up and become your normal self. Theatre kids can often be pranksters -- resist the urge to laugh at the pair of Juan's boxers sitting on the bar you now have to use as a rag and be the best barman this side of the Mississippi.


If there is a stage mishap or something doesn’t happen as planned, just stay in character and react the way your character would. Gunshot didn't go off? Well it's a good thing you have this knife on your upstage side that the audience can't see! Ha HA! Sound guy fell asleep again. That guy really needs to be fired.

, Sometimes, worrying about messing up or other people’s reactions can ruin your state of mind. Often if you're having fun, the audience will be able to tell and have fun with you.


Take criticism with a grain of salt. If your director is telling you to do something differently, don’t take it as a personal insult. Instead, see it as a chance to improve your acting.
Your acting improves and is more natural when you are having fun instead of stressing out. By being positive and relieving tension and stress, you’ll be able to slip into your character more easily.

, Practice relaxation exercises, get into character and stop worrying about how others will perceive you. You don't do this because it's anxiety-provoking! You do it because it feels awesome.


Look in the mirror and say, “I am no longer myself. I am now .” You are not yourself anymore, so you don’t have to worry about what people think about you. Remember that when you do something, audience members aren’t seeing you. They’re seeing your character.

, Be aware of when it’s your time to go onstage or enter a scene. You'll have half a dozen people on your case (beside the voices in your head) if you miss your cue. When it’s almost your turn, you should be waiting in the wings (or off camera), getting yourself in character with your props ready.


Go to the bathroom before the performance starts. You don’t want to miss your cue because you were off using the restroom having a nervous pee or grabbing something to eat.
Listen carefully for your cue. Even if you think you know around what time you’re supposed to go on, be aware and listen carefully to the scene that’s happening. Don’t get distracted or talk to other people.
If there is an emergency and you absolutely have to go to the restroom or run to your car, let someone know even if you think you’ll be back in time for your scene. HAHA. Did you catch that? That was a joke. Funny, huh? Okay, okay, emergencies do exist. But unless someone died or your insides are about to explode, you make that cue. You'll probably not have to tell anyone as you rocket to the nearest receptacle, heaving your guts out. They'll most likely notice.

, When you’re in a play or on camera, you want to know where you should be spatially. To be put tersely, ""find the light."" Stay in it. It's there to illuminate you.


When you speak, turn slightly towards the audience. This is called ""quartering."" You want the audience to be able to see you and hear your voice, while making it believable that you're having a conversation. If your director tells you you're closed, moved 90º (a quarter of a circle) outward.
If you’re filming something, don’t look directly at the camera unless you're on an episode of the Office and the director tells you that you should. Instead, speak to the other actors and interact with the surroundings as your character would.

, The director knows the overall picture of the production, so he or she will know what they are talking about. Take their criticism or suggestions seriously. If they want you to do something and you understand why, do it..


Follow stage directions and incorporate them when you’re practicing your lines. That being said, if you don't understand why, ask! You do not want to cross the stage not knowing why the heck you're doing it. Your director will love that you're trying to understand your character.
Ask questions (before your director says anything) if you’re unclear about how you should do something. If you’re not sure about how to react to something or how you should deliver a certain line, don’t be afraid to ask the director. They usually have a pretty clear sense of what they’re looking for.

, Remember that acting is not all about you and that the entire production is a team effort.Where would you be without the other actors, prop, tech, and costume crew? Naked on a poorly lit stage all by yourself, that's where.


If you have the leading role in a production, no, you don't have the hardest part. Calm down and step off your ivory tower. Try running an entire crew or running the sound and light board simultaneously for the entire show. What happens when the sound cue guy gets mad at you? He doesn't hit the button for your gunshot. Haha. So be nice -- they can make or break you. There is no ""I"" in this team.

, You can nail every single line you have, but if you're not listening to the other person conversing with you, it's done for. Stick a fork in you because the fat lady has sung. Maybe the other actor took it an entirely different direction and now the scene is more passively heated than intense and angry -- you have to keep pace with the scene, wherever it goes. So act, yes. But react just as much.


Read your lines with your fellow actors and practice. Even if you know your lines perfectly yourself, you need to work with other people on delivery and work on the scene together. You should be playing off of your fellow actors, not just delivering lines by yourself. Have fun and experiment with it! That's the fun in acting.

, Though you're technically not supposed to break the fourth wall (in most productions, at least), they're there. They're there and you have to work with them. And don't forget that them being there is a good thing. A great thing, rather! Feed off their energy. There's nothing quite like it.


When the audience laughs or applauds, give 'em a minute to shower you with affection. Okay, not a minute, but feel the scene. Let it die down a bit before you progress. Feel where they are and where you should go with the scene. This may seem a bit abstract, but as you get more experience, it'll make sense.

, You want to build a rapport with the people you’re working with and show them that you appreciate the work they’ve done. They've worked just as hard as you have!


Wish your fellow actors good luck and tell them when you thought they did a great job. Say, “Break a leg!” before they go on stage and, “You did great!” after they’re done.
Thank the crew members for all their hard work. For example, if you had a really great makeup artist, you can tell her, “I really appreciate the work you’ve done. I couldn’t have looked more like the character!”

Keep tabs on the industry.",How to Become an Actor," Though it's possible to do without this step, if you don't live in LA or New York, this is a pretty standard go-to option. Alternatively, you can join a local theater group. You'll get exposure to the pros, learn about techniques, and get automatic chances to work on a stage. For the more tangible stuff, you'll be building your resume, getting exposure and setting up a network. And your teachers will constantly be pushing you to do more, practically taking care of the motivation part for you.


What do Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen, Tom Cruise, Pam Anderson and Jessica Simpson all have in common? Apart from being the absolute cream of the celebrity crop, they all didn't finish high school.So while it's completely possible to achieve massive amounts of success without the formal education, just, err, take it with a grain of salt.;
, Some of these can be intensive enough that you'll learn months worth of material in a period of 2 to 3 weeks. You can be involved in multiple shows doing multiple things and possibly even get stipends for your work.


While school isn't going on, it's important to stay on top of your game, and attending camps and workshops is a good way to do it. If you're stuck with a job that keeps you from being able to attend these, make sure you're always reading and researching your craft. Go to shows, read up on theory, and expose yourself to new ideas and schools of thought.
If you're interested in stage theatre, summer stock is a great way to get started. Plays, musicals, and even operas get put up in a matter of weeks all throughout the country and offer very valuable life experience.Find an audition near you in the spring to gear up for the season once school's out.

, This process can be a step above college theater if the theater takes the productions seriously and has a decent budget. Winning a role in a community theater production will put you in contact with others who are polishing their craft just like you and garner you more experience. You'll also get a better idea of where you stand in relation to the competition.


Even if you're not looking to work for the stage or do straight plays or musicals, any experience in the field of drama looks good on your resume and will teach you things you didn't know. And you'll make friends, too!

, Your coach can give you the personal attention you need to tackle your weak spots as well as polish what you do well. Look for a coach with a lot of industry experience and connections.


Hit up the staff and faculty at the school you attend or a theatre you've worked with. Someone will surely know someone else (who knows somebody) that can hook you up with what you're looking for. And if they can sing and/or dance, that doesn't hurt either!

, Many ""acting resumes"" will require you to know what skills you have, such as accents, special abilities or impersonations. Expand these talents as much as you can so that you appeal to a wide range of casting calls.


Finding where your skills lie can help you determine which route to take. The call of an actor varies widely -- for starters, do you see yourself on the silver screen or on the stage?

, Preferably LA, though you can start from scratch anywhere that has a decent film scene. You may have to take a waitressing job, but if it gets you a flexible schedule to make it to casting calls, great. That's all you need.


To take this seriously, a big city is the only way to do it. If your financial situation doesn't allow for it, start making efforts to change that. Where there's a will, there's a way.

, Once you're where you need to be, get connected (literally) and take on roles as an extra, or background actor. Open casting calls for these can be found all over the Internet, but a few places to start off are Backstage, Hollywood Reporter and Variety.


It won't be glamorous, but you don't have to put a glamorous rating on your resume. More than likely you'll be left to your lonesome 75% of the time, so bring a book, some knitting, or something to amuse yourself with as the crew spends hours adjusting the lights.

, This is your go-to for auditions and staying in the loop. And a good one will only get paid when you're successful, so don't buy into the ones that demand some exorbitant fee even if your schedule stays wide open.


Ask around your network for opinions on who to go to and how to get started. Other actors will definitely have opinions on the matter and may be able to even set you up with theirs.

, You're about to hit the big time, kid! Getting into a union is a clear-cut sign that you're taking this seriously. Once you take an apprenticeship or do some background work, you're pretty much in. Hello, health benefits!


Look into organizations like ACTRA, AEA, AGMA or AGVA. Once you get into one of those, it's pretty easy to get into SAG (the Screen Actor's Guild). All you gotta do is find work occasionally and pay your dues. Well worth it.

, Stage acting requires a completely different (okay, maybe not completely different) set of skills than film acting. It's pretty easy to spot a stage actor when they venture to the screen. When on a stage, you have to entertain people from practically miles away -- as a result, everything you do must be larger.


So start working on your voice. It's your moneymaker. Stay away from cigarettes, alcohol, and anything that dehydrates your vocal folds and wears 'em out. You need to be loud and proud at all times.

, Many a stage actor would argue that it's harder than film acting; after all, the film actor gets to hide behind the camera. On stage, you're making the magic yourself. Start taking classes that convince audiences you're the real thing.


Stage combat classes can show you how to fight convincingly without getting injured or simply looking like a loon. Knowing how to do it can open up a number of roles, in both straight plays and in musicals.
Work on dialects. A dialect coach can get you started quite easily here. If you already don't sound like a generalized version of your ethnicity, you may need to work on getting rid of yours. Otherwise you may find yourself typecast more often than not.
Become a triple threat. If you're even slightly interested in musical theatre, it's a good idea to get into voice lessons and dance classes. Having just one (or even two) skills isn't enough to seriously crack into the industry.
Do something out of the ordinary. If you were a clown for 12 years, great! That's useful. If you moonlight as a gymnast, fantastic. Yodel? Superb. Any skills that most other performers don't have may pay off in the long-run. So keep up your hobbies -- they'll make you more marketable.

, Though it's completely possible to run through all the hoops without it and still find success, having your equity card opens up a number of auditions that otherwise wouldn't be available to you.


It's not a clear-cut process, unfortunately. You either have to get a contract that requires equity standing, be a member of a sister group (like SAG, for example), or accumulate enough credits to meet the standard.It's natural to find the process a bit confusing, so contact a friend or mainstay in your actor's social network for more information on how they did -- everyone goes about it differently.

, If you had training, odds are you have a repertoire full of 'em that you can pull out at a moment's notice. If not, it's pretty easy (read: takes a few seconds with an Internet search) to find one. These short segments (usually between 1-2 minutes) are often used to cast you in plays, movies and shows. They allow you to showcase your talents in a short period of time.


You'll want contrasting monologues. Even if you always play the funny man, have a couple serious monologues ready to whip out when requested.
For singers, you'll need 16-32 bars of a few songs ready and mastered. Some auditions won't specify a genre while some will want you to show them something similar to what they're producing. So have a few ready at the go.

, Add any productions that you've done at camps, workshops, universities and community theater. If it's even semi-related, you're good to go. Backstage work counts too! Show them how balanced you are if you have tech, props, or costume experience to boot.


List any special abilities that you have (dancing, singing, dialects, combat, etc.) on your resume. Don't lie too much, though. You might get caught being asked to tap your way through a monologue even if you conveniently forgot your tap shoes.

, Decide your type. Do you do best in leading roles or in character roles? Are you the next leading lady or the perfect creepy villain? Specializing in the beginning will help you to target the best auditions for your abilities.


There is nothing wrong with being typecast. In fact, if you go into auditions aiming for your type, you're more likely to find success. Would anyone argue that Helena Bonham Carter isn't a legitimate actress, even though she plays the same role over and over? No. She just knows what she's good at and she rocks it every time. So take a look at yourself -- what comes the most naturally?

, The first thing that a director or producer will see about you is the headshot that accompanies your resume. It's in your best interest to get these ASAP and get a whole bunch printed -- you'll be handing them out like candy. Make sure they're current! Don't use a photo of you from 5 years ago.


It's not hard to get cheap headshots done well. Often photographers are in the same position you are and are trying just to build up their portfolio. Ask around for any emerging photographers willing to take you on for a small fee, or even free. The great thing about headshots is that no set is required and nothing fancy-schmancy is necessary.

, You can't control what the director who's casting the project will think of you, but you can control how well you present yourself. Show up on time, know your audition material, bring any materials that you need (including a pen or pencil) and look your best. That's really all you can do.


Be talkative. You never know who you'll meet that can get you in. That guy hiding in the corner with a headset on probably has way more power than you realize. And even if he doesn't now, he may later. So chat up those around you and dig your toes into the acting sandbox.

, Taking auditions is a good way to be seen about town. Once people start to recognize you, they'll be more likely to consider you for roles. Getting your name out there is half the battle.


You'll get no's. You'll get loads of no's. Everyone does. The job part of acting is the auditioning -- if you never auditioned, it wouldn't be a job. So take the no's lightly and keep going. A yes will come eventually.

, You are an artist, but you're also in business for yourself. You're marketing your face, your voice, your body and your acting skills. Be aware that the people you audition for will see you as a product, and they will be looking at you as a way to make money. This is neither good or nor bad, but knowing that's how it is will keep your head on your shoulders.


Don't let this depress you; let it empower you. Rejection isn't about you personally. It's about you not matching their idea of the product that they want. You'll match someone else's product later.

, Put your headshot online as well as your resume. Actors Access is a great place to start. Put videos of your performances on YouTube. Set up a Facebook page and a Twitter account. It's a long shot, but you never know who may randomly stumble upon your info and decide to hire you. Plus, you can build a loyal fan base through social media. Double win.


Get your own website! Why not?

, Be approachable and build your reputation as a professional with whom others like to work. The people in your network can connect you to available jobs and can provide you with valuable insights about your work and about the business.


Avoid developing a bad reputation. If you get coined as lazy, difficult to work with, or just downright snooty, you're less likely to get gigs. Don't go around asking for the orange M&Ms picked out just yet.

, Check out industry papers and websites like Variety.com, Backstage.com, Showbusinessweekly.com, and Hollywoodreporter.com to find out what are the current trends in the business. Constantly go to shows and work on side projects with friends and acquaintances to keep your creative flame a-burning.


Get reading, studying, and connecting. Though you may think acting is something you have or you don't, it's not that simple. Stay up on emerging playwrights and directors, familiarize yourself with theories, and get yourself out there. Knowing in which direction ""the scene"" is going will help keep you ahead of the curve. Maybe you'll be inspiration for the next big project!

Determine which character you will try out for and practice for that part.,
Go to auditions with a positive attitude.

,
Be prepared to sing, dance and read lines from a script.,
Do character research on the different characters:


Seymour Krelborn: Has a high baritone singing voice.",How to Audition for Little Shop of Horrors,";
,, Different directors require different things in auditions. Try to find out ahead of time what the director of your production will require.

, He's a bit of a klutz, and he's a nerd. He's also deeply in love with Audrey, his coworker. The actor portraying Seymour must learn to speak softly while still projecting. He should never fade into the curtain.
Audrey: Uses a very high and squeaky voice in some productions. Her singing parts are also higher. Audrey has a bit of a Brooklyn accent, like saying ""Da"" instead of ""the"". Ask the director what elements they would like to include in the role.
Mr. Mushnik: Uses foreign accent to sing with, Dutch or Russian would be best. The movie used a heavier actor but physical appearances will probably not be a factor in a school or local production. He's Seymour and Audrey's boss at the flower shop, and when he rants, it sounds like Yiddish.
Orin Scrivello (D.D.S.): An evil, sadistic dentist who dresses like a leftover from the movie Grease (and who also happens to be Audrey's boyfriend), he speaks with a relatively cool and low drawl. His singing role includes some spoken and yelled words, and the actor portraying him must learn to laugh like he's on drugs.
Audrey 2 (voice): Sings in a powerful, deep R&B bass-baritone voice but some parts require higher notes. (sung to Tenor Bb if ""Mean Green Mother"" is included.) A good vocal range IS required, plus (if the director wishes) a good understanding of 70's African-American idiom within R&B/Funk. (Vocal growl, pops & whistles. Watch the movie.) This part also includes an evil laugh. Work out a way to yell in a melodically low voice.
Audrey 2 (puppetry): In addition to the voice, a puppeteer needs to be on stage manipulating three of the four Audrey II puppets, being on stage for the majority of the show. While a trained puppeteer is generally preferred, if there is none, then generally a strong person will probably get the position.

Show up on time.,
Turn off your cellphone.,
Don't take pictures in the theater.,
Applaud when appropriate, refrain from whistling or hollering.,
Don't snack in the theater.,
Sit quietly and don't disturb others.,
The only time talking or whispering is acceptable is during intermission.,
Take your child/children to age appropriate shows, or consider leaving them with a babysitter.,
Don't leave until the show is over.,
Wear proper attire.",How to Practise Proper Etiquette for a Broadway Show," Note that if you arrive late, you may be unable to get to your assigned seat for the first act. If an emergency prevents you from arriving on time, the ushers will try their hardest to seat you in an empty seat in the back. You should be able to get to your assigned seat by the second act. Beware: some actors have been known to point out those who arrive late.;
, People will be escorted out of the theater if their cellphone goes off. It is considered distracting to the people around you and to the actors performing. There will most likely be a reminder at the beginning of the play to turn off all electronics, so make sure you adhere to it. This applies to text messaging too. Even when your phone is set to silent, the light from it can be distracting to others around you, and if you do receive a call or text, the transmissions from your phone can interfere with sound equipment in the theater. Shut off your phone until the intermission or end of the show.

, While it is completely acceptable to take pictures outside of the play, as soon as you enter, turn your camera off. The plays are copyrighted. Distributing copyrighted images is considered copyright infringement, so keep the camera in your bag.

, General theater etiquette states that whistling and cheering are in bad taste.

, If refreshments are sold in the lobby, consume them before the show or during intermission. The sounds of eating, including the crinkling of wrappers, the chewing of food, or the smacking of chewing gum, are all distracting. If you are diabetic, bring quiet food such as raisins to address a potential insulin reaction (low blood sugar).

, The other patrons came to watch the show, so please be respectful. Avoid wearing hats, or leaning too close to your friend or partner and blocking the view of the people behind you. Leaning forward or holding a child also prevents others from seeing the show.

, Never ask the people around you what is being said. Also, never sing along with the actors during a performance! If you are hard of hearing, ask the usher for a special hearing device for the play. Remember, the actors are live. They can hear you too.

, Children under twelve often have difficulties sitting still for long periods of time, and will most likely not grasp the story line of the play anyway. If you must bring your children, keep them under control.

, The show isn't over until the actors have done curtain calls. If you leave earlier, it's considered extremely rude to them because they've worked so hard to entertain you.

, This isn't necessary, but is preferred. Broadway used to demand formal attire. Although full blown evening gowns and a tuxedo are no longer required, you should still attempt to wear neat and presentable clothing.

Most importantly, have fun!",How to Be a Good Pantomime Audience Member," One of the things an pantomime actor hates is the audience sitting there silently throughout the whole thing. It's frustrating for them, and that will affect their performance, and therefore your enjoyment of the show.;
, It's virtually impossible to try to capture the audience's attention if they won't make eye contact.

, Don't worry about offending the actors who play the baddies - they want you to boo them! It gives them something to work with.

, Pantomimes generally have songs in them, and it takes a lot of courage to sing on stage.

, Actors have probably spent literally weeks perfecting their comic timing. The least you could do is laugh.

, It makes everyone feel like their hard work has paid off, makes their confidence grow and this and adds to the quality of performance.

, That means no rustling sweet wrappers and no loud talking.

, It is highly irritating if it goes of in mid performance.

, Simple as.

, That is what you have an interval for. If you eat food in the theatre, it gives the cleaners so much more work.

, If you're not polite, they'll be grumpy and less likely to help you, which means no one wins.

, This is your cue to do concert style arm waving. It's little things like this that really makes actors feel happy and like you were a great audience.

, If actors can see you're having fun, they'll have fun too! And fun is infectious, so hopefully it'll spread to the rest of of the audience!

Dress for the occasion.",How to Audition for a Local Theater," Find out what part you're auditioning for, when the time period is, and what you need to portray in order to get the part. Also double check the rehearsal times to make sure it does not interfere with your schedule, because the last thing you want is to get the lead and then have to quit because it interferes. This will only give you a bad reputation.;
, Most companies will have a form for you to fill out but already having a pre-made resume will help you look prepared! When you go to the audition, they will need to know your past experience as well as any special skills you have. They also need to how to contact you. Write your name, email address, home phone, and address at the top and then any experience you've had in past productions, music, dance and acting. If you already have a resume, bring it!

, If it is a musical you are auditioning for, you will need to sing a piece from a Broadway musical. Choosing a proper song is crucial. First of all, rule out any music from Wicked, Rent, Les Miserable or Cats. These musicals are so huge and so overdone. You want a piece that hasn't been used very much. Your song should represent your vocal capabilities and show your strengths.

, This could mean either they love you and already know exactly what part you're going to get, or they can tell what your voice type is from the first few verses and don't need to hear any more.

, It is very important to bring sheet music. In some theatres, they won't even take you into consideration if you don't have sheet music. It makes you sound better and keeps you on key! A capella is not allowed unless they specify it!

, At the theatre, they may have you learn a small piece from the play (only a couple of steps) just so the choreographer can get a feel on who has rhythm and who has two left feet. If you aren't a very good dancer, practice a bit before. The moves are usually very basic and you may not even be asked to do it. Just make sure you dress in clothes that are easy to move in and bring dance shoes if you have them.

, You can almost be guaranteed that they will ask you to recite a monologue. You can find them all over the internet. Make sure that the monologue you choose is age appropriate and if you are auditioning for a role, make sure it fits that sort of character. Your monologue should be about 2 minutes long and memorized. Also, bring with you an extra copy of the words as a reference just in case you freeze.

, Make sure what you wear is comfortable and easy to move in while still looking presentable. You want to show them you are prepared and ready. Break a leg!

Although each season had it's own introductory statement, the same statement was used throughout each episode in the season. At first it asked questions like ""What show lets you run wild through a Supermarket? (To which the audience yelled Supermarket Sweep) or ""What show lets you grab everything you can get your hands on?(again, the audience yells Supermarket Sweep) and several other statement questions. However, following this, the announcer to the show asked for players from three teams of two in the audience (later in the series' run when this show went onto the PAX-TV channel, they filmed the three sets of 2 contestants running around the corner opposite the audience area from the supermarket) ""Who's got the (product name)?"" To which point, they told them ""OK, you're on!"" And following these, the announcer called ""And here's our host, David Ruprecht"".;
, There were several parts to this game, with each part containing several pricing games that were related to pricing products you'd find on the average supermarket shelf and which related to time you'd obtain to run the Big Sweep at the end of the game, the winner of that game going onto the Bonus sweep all to earn your $5,000 prize

, The game began with each team being awarded a free minute and thirty second time that they could use in the Big Sweep at the end of the game.

The show began with what Supermarket Sweep called the ""Mini sweep"" which was introduced a year into the show's run on Lifetime after the company realized that the players weren't being given enough Big Sweep time and could pick up some money in the end as a result. The host gave a clue to a product using a rhyming phrase/sentence. These were very easy, and sometimes you could even tell which item they were trying to find by listening to the intonation of the words that were boldly mentioned. The player who guessed the right answer, could pick up either a free $50 (if they brought back this product within 30 seconds) or $100 (if brought back within 20 seconds).
They asked the players to split up. One player of each team stayed onset and the other was asked to leave. Leading up to the Round Robin round, only one player was allowed out on the floor to play the remainder of the pricing game. However, halfway through (up until the first advertisement) these players switched and ended up playing more pricing games - all in an attempt to pick up time for the Big Sweep.
Throughout this series' run, they played several pricing games. For most pricing games they had, what the teams won from guessing correctly would be time to add to the Sweep time. Sometimes even, teams would get 10 seconds of sweep time for only 1 correct answer out of 3 (if given a pricing game where they had to select 1 of 3 prices along a row of products) (Such as pick the product with the lowest price: 1) Axe deodorant 2) Planters Peanuts or 3) Box of Kleenex tissues (price would be based on Pacific coast prices)). (this type of game was common before the first advertisement break, but could sometimes happen following the first podium pricing game (if the game happened during the PAX-TV run of the series. If all three contestants chose to answer the same way to a multiple choice question and were all correct, all three would pick up an extra thirty seconds of Sweep time.

A large variety of games was played and due to the length and differences between these games, you can find this information .
Towards the end of this series' run, some of these pricing games were done at a podium at a head-to-head challenge between two teams and the winner of that first round played the third team. The winner of that round ended up claiming Sweep time. The second players to come out (after the first advertisement break) would generally have this opportunity to help their team pick up Sweep time. However, these podium games weren't always a part of the show from the beginning of the series' time.



, Round Robin has been an integral part of the Supermarket Sweep series. Playing with both team members, Round Robin featured several scrambled lettered words or phrases to products that you had to decipher. Each correct guess would earn the team 10 additional seconds of Sweep time. As was said by the host, Round Robin ""was the last chance for these players to earn Sweep time"" in the pricing games segment of the show. There were six questions in Round Robin in each game per episode. Although some scrambled words were easier than others, there were some really easy ones to answer to (which sometimes consisted of 4 or 5 letters or that contained only one word of a short number of letters). At first, there were three clues that were read rather slowly. If no one got the scrambled lettered words the first time through, during the second time it would be read faster and if still no one answered it or had gotten it incorrect, the question was eliminated from play and no one would get time for that question. After that, the host reminded the teams of their total run times for their use in the Sweep and asked the teams to pick the players who will be the ""runners"" in the Sweep., This was an integral part of many fans' minds. The host reads through the teams' times and says ""Everything in these aisles is up for grabs. Fill as many carts as you can."" (These two sentences never changed very much, throughout this series' history.) The host announced the daily specials (which could have included bonus balloons (inflatable balloons that looked like supermarket products that rested on the floor), coffee (grind a pound of coffee beans and seal the bag and you win money, though the button had to be held down to be operated), candy (fill a bag of candy with a dollar's worth of loose candy (plus or minus 2 cents) and win yourself some bonus cash), shopping list announcements (this could have included a magazine rack , jelly belly machine, international bread center, fruit fantasy, breakfast break, cake display or a Frozen Yogurt Machine)/Manager's Special (aka Red Tag Special)/Stack Job/Super Sandwich, Mystery Product (pieces of the product name were found on television monitors found sporadically through the supermarket), Sweep Swipe, Giant Box of Laundry Detergent.The host then mentioned ""The team who picks up the most money in merchandise and bonus prizes, wins the game and the right to go for 5,000 dollars.""

(On the ABC viewing of the show, this also included Cracker Jackpot/Jolly Time is Money, Balloon Pop, Instant Coupon Machines and Double/Triple Coupons)..
Stepping off to an ""on your mark"" phrase, the runners would race through the aisles collecting as much stuff in their carts as they could fit. They were limited to a quantity of 5 items for each item. If they knocked over or did something to a product they weren't intended to pick up they either had to place it back onto the shelf or pick it up and put it in their cart.Their partners were not to be in the aisles with the runner - the partner was to be waiting behind the checkout counter waiting for their partner to return with a full cart so they could begin loading their items onto the supermarket register belt.Generally it was just team 1 that set off first followed by Teams 2 and followed by team 3. However, on occasion there were times when team 1 and 2 set off together leaving team 3 to race in later. Rarely did it ever happen that all three teams race into the market together.
Almost always, teams raced towards the aisles containing the high-expensive items such as diapers and baby formula, beef and poultry, garden hoses and even over-the-counter pharmaceutical items. However, the meats and pharmacy aisles were other common places teams would race to. However, this differed by each teams' plans they talked about off-stage.

Each shopping cart was labelled with the team number in an ovular shaped cardboard. Carts were the standard size shopping cart that might have been a little deeper than average, but not as much as to hinder the effects or put team's ""plans"" for conquer in jeopardy.


Teams were penalized money from their grand total for wrong-doings such as knocking into or over a camera man or stage crew person or not picking up products that they dropped on the supermarket floor.Runners must stop ""shopping"" when the clock reached 0:00 and the bell rang, even if they haven't gotten their limit of five of the item (what they had in their carts was final; not even the stuff that was in their hand being dropped into their cart when the bell rang could even count).
During the first season when this program was on Lifetime, the show didn't round the dollar amounts of cash and prizes that the team won. However, this was later changed and they did round it to the nearest dollar.Also during the first season, there would be a costumed character running down the aisles. If a runner came near them, they would have to turn around and go in another direction.After the last advertisement, the host would reveal the mystery product (most often because the runners didn't retrieve this product in the show or because they didn't want to say it three times if all three teams grabbed this product) along with the totals of each team's cart. The team would receive one minute on the clock and a set of three clues. Once given the first clue, the team would race into the market one last time to try and retrieve the clues in order. This would lead the team to the second clue and after three clues, they would grab the money and win the grand bonus prize of $5,000.

, Generally, one clue would be a rhyming pattern and would be very easy to guess (sometimes you could even hear the key words in the sentence/phrase used from the host's mouth) however, others weren't quite as easy. If players didn't reach the money after the minute was up, each item found was worth $200 added onto the Big Sweep total of take-home money for that shopping day, while if the team retrieved the 5,000, the $5,000 was theirs but they had to forego the $200 for each item price.If the team found clue number 3 and the money before completing the other clues (this rarely happened), they had to forfeit the money entirely and lost the game.Rarely did team 3 ever make it to the Bonus Sweep, but they did make it occasionally.
The sentence phrase would fill in on the screen when the team mentions that they knew the exact product that might contain the item or pass right by it.
Each item that had a clue had an insignia of the show's famous supermarket cart icon on it. This never changed during the entire series' when Lifetime and PAX-TV had it's contract of it.

, The host would sign off towards the end of the show with ""If you're at a checkout counter and hear the beep, think of all the fun you'd be having on (the contestants would help with filling this in) ""Supermarket Sweep"""". If items were unfound in the end credits, the host and the team contestants would try to find the unsolved clue's location to try to find the next clue (more often than not, this was the last clue leading them to the big money, although sometimes teams would be stuck partway through the list of clues)., Although the pricing games round(s) contestants wore their everyday shirts, during the Big Sweep and Bonus Sweep rounds contestants would wear special colored t-shirts (or colored sweatshirts if the market was that cool for the contestant). Generally, during the PAX-TV era, team 1 wore a red shirt, team 2 wore a blue shirt and team 3 wore a yellow shirt. However, during the first few years of Lifetime, team 1 and team 3's colors switched. Each team had shirts denoting their team number on the front (written in yellow near the top right of the shirt) and on the back had the show's logo and bigger number of the team number on the shirt.

, Although the show had some special occurrences that happened every once and awhile, they were rather rare and only happened once or twice per season. Sometimes it would be a week-long series devoted solely to past winners from the past year, or even when the show recorded their 1,000th show they had one. They also had other special event episodes that were titled ""Cruise weeks"" where instead of solely winning the money they also won an all-expenses paid cruise to an unknown place (unknown to the viewer, but was known beforehand to the contestants). In one instance, they won a pair of cars (Geo Tracker) during what they called ""Twin Car Giveaways"", but these specials didn't happen all that often., Supermarket Sweep aired over several years on several channels. Although when it first came out on December 20, 1965 and was shown till July 14, 1967 it aired on ABC, when it re-debuted on Lifetime network (Lifetime later became more ""woman oriented programming"") between February 5, 1990 and May 26, 1995 things changed (including the episodes being longer and in color) and later when the contract got moved yet again to what would then be PAX-TV (now ""ION Television"") things didn't change much and it ran for a few more seasons, finishing up the series (for now) and running there from April 3, 2000 to May 23, 2003.However, these programs are no longer playing in syndication in the United States, but many fans are illegally posting real, full episodes on YouTube if you search by using the search term ""Supermarket Sweep"" and the year the episode came out (while some users place the contestants names in the title of the video instead of the year and place the year in the video description). As a regular series, this show presented 1,111 shows..


Each episode ran for one half hour block. However, this block changed many times over the course of it's history between 3pm EST and ending at 5:30pm EST (dependent on when the station scheduled the time to happen) and only aired one episode per day, each weekday (especially on the PAX-TV run).

, Although David Ruprecht was the host during both the Lifetime and PAX-TV runs of the show, a person by the name of Bill Malone was the host of the ABC run of the show. Supermarket Sweep was the only TV game show David Ruprecht hosted, though he did perform on many other TV shows and movies (including some ""made for TV movies"")., On top of doing several voiceovers during the beginning of each of the seasons of the introduction to the show, the voiceover man's names during the Lifetime and PAX-TV season's included Johnny Gilbert and Randy West. Both men have nearly similar voices when heard speaking into the microphone. During earlier episodes, these voices were a combination of two voices including Wally King and Richard Hayes.And besides this, about the only one of these that did other voiceovers was Randy West if you read his bio.

If you don’t get the part, don’t argue about it.",How to Act at an Audition," The most important thing to remember is that you need to make a positive impression on the auditioning panel. You need to be able to go in and make yourself memorable. You cannot afford to assume that you are going to get a part simply because you were in a previous show, or that you have acting experience with another theater.;
, Many times, selecting actors for a given role is subjective. There are several factors that play into who is chosen for the part. The most important part is the audition itself, so you do want to get that right, but there are other things as well. Many times, the director already has an idea about what kind of person they are looking for (although a great audition can change their mind). The director also considers how each of the characters fit with those they will be performing with. For instance, if they are part of a family, the director has to consider how the family looks together. Sometimes, you may get passed over for a part even though there was nothing wrong with your audition. For one reason or another, you just may not have fit in with the director’s vision.

, When you get to the audition, there will be a registration table. You will have to fill out an audition form. That form will ask you for contact information, previous theater experience, and if there are any times and dates you will not be available for rehearsals. Your photo will be attached to this form so the director can see your information when you go in for the actual audition. You will be given a small section of script that you will perform before the director and the producers. Going before a panel of strangers can be a little intimidating for some children and even adults. Letting them know what to expect will really help them to be able to relax.

, Don’t just read. Put feeling into what you say, react to what would be going on around you, and get into character.

, Yes, there are times when simply being a cute little kid is enough, but for the most part, directors are looking for true actors. So many people stand before the director and simply read the lines they were given that when someone really tries to act out the part, they make a big impression. You need to stand out from the crowd if you want to be cast.

, Directors often see many, many people, and it can be hard to remember each and every person that came in. You must ensure that the director remembers who you are if you want to be cast, and having a photo ready can help with that.

, With a simple internet search, you can find out a lot about what the performance is about, what other companies have done, and how you need to act for your wanted part.

, Remember, you need to act, not just read. Take some time to get familiar with the part you are given to audition with as soon as you can. The more prepared you are, the better your chances of getting a part.

, How would that person react in a certain situation? What mood is the person in your part of the script? Who is the person talking to? While you may not get your interpretation completely perfect, thinking of things from this perspective increases your chances of getting the part.

, If you need more time to prepare when your number is called, ask for a little more time. Most likely, the director will give you a few more minutes. It's better to request a little more time to ensure a good audition than to rush into it too soon.

, Speaking quickly shows nervousness, and unless your character is actually nervous in that part of the script, you won't be acting correctly. Shove your own emotions down and convey the emotion the script wants you to. Remember, the director will want your character to seem like a real person, and part of that is acting how that character is supposed to act.

, If you have a small child auditioning, and that child cannot read well, having the kid read from a script is nearly impossible. Try teaching your child a short poem or nursery rhyme so the child will have something to present.

, A good actor will work through a mistake without letting the audience know something went wrong. Keep your poise, hold your character together, and act as if the mistake was intentional.

, This not only makes a good impression, but raises the chances that your audience will be more alert and remember you. The later you audition, the harder it will be to make an impression. Arrange your schedule to get there at the beginning, even if it means waiting in line to audition.

, Nobody is guaranteed a spot in a play. It doesn't matter what other roles you've had or what other theaters you've worked with. If you are not thought to be fit for the role, you won't be cast. Being an actor with good experience who auditions well will get you a part, not your past performances.

, The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll be. This means a better performance, because the more you go through the process, the easier it becomes.

, The decisions the director makes are up to that person alone. Please respect that person's decision. It doesn't always mean that you had a bad audition, or that you're not a good actor. It simply means that you were not the best actor for this part in this show. Also, arguing leaves a bad impression. You won't change anybody's mind. It will only lower your chances of getting cast in future productions by that director. Although asking how you can improve is appropriate, starting a fight will not help.

Organize your Readers' Theatre.,
Set your location.,
Set your practice time.,
Decide whether you will need to charge fees or not.",How to Direct Readers' Theatre1," You're going to need a practice location, a set practice time, scripts, and the director.


Have an application for parents to fill out and sign including a disclaimer of certain legalities (give the parent or responsible adult a copy). Have warning signs to post for safety.
If you have only been asked to direct, you can also offer to help organize and publicize the theatre group.
It's recommended that you get an assistant director, if you have more than 15 people; above this number you will usually need to split the actors into separate groups to undertake separate practices so as to avoid having people sit around being bored and creating discipline problems. If you're already well immersed in acting, chances are, you know other people around town who are familiar with acting and directing and would be willing to help out. Call them up and explain to them what they would be doing and what benefits they'd get from being involved: Readers' Theatre is a popular choice for parents, educators and groups looking to encourage participation and nurture the creative spirit.
Think up a name for your Readers' Theatre. It can be very simple (like the name of the town/city where you live) or something to do with theatre arts.;
, Look for any small buildings for rent (drive around, look online, ask people, etc.). Narrow down your choice to three suitable places, and go to see them, walk through them and get a good feel for them. What you're looking for is a nice, wide-open space able to accommodate any stunts or running around, and that has a few chairs, a bathroom and a break room. Check that it has suitably bright lights, so the actors can get used to acting in this environment. Ask about an especially low cost, the availability and consider security.


Look at community centres, university/college spaces, high schools, etc., and anywhere else where they may be able to loan you the space for free or next-to-nothing after you've explained what you're doing. This is especially useful when you're just starting out and you're stretched for funds.
Ask about empty stores -- in an old shopping center, or on the main street in a small town -- that have remained unoccupied for some time. The owner may be happy to let you use it for nothing, if rental chances are low; your system could even end up featured as a local newspaper story that can help the landlord! Check that it's properly insured and safe though. Providing your own insurance may be very expensive. If you can, then incorporate (such as LLC), to limit personal liability for the event of accident or other problems.

, Make the practice time conveniently fit between meal hours and school hours (if it's for kids), being sure it's a ""relaxing"" time (like the afternoon, or early evening). Every other day may work (like Monday, Wednesday and Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday). Decide what is realistic in terms of time commitment, too. Some people might not be able to commit to three practices a week but could manage one or two. You'll need to account for this and occasionally schedule a theatre group accordingly.


You may need to be flexible about changing the chosen practice time after a while, if it becomes clear that people find the time difficult for one reason or another. Set an initial time, then be prepared to revise it later, if a majority of the group thinks that a change in time would be beneficial for all.

, Perhaps you'll charge a nominal fee to cover expenses and treat the actors as volunteers. Or perhaps you'll charge fees and treat the actors as pupils. This might be organized in cooperation with a church or a city community/civic center. If you do intend on charging fees, have evidence of your qualifications to show potential actors that you are genuine and capable. In either case, people will be keen to know what qualifies you to direct Readers' Theatre, so have a nice spiel written and practiced about your training and experience, for both print and conversation.

"
"
Advertise your Readers' Theatre.,
Emphasize that Readers' Theatre plays promote confidence, reading skills and good study habits using simple scripts for plays such as books, holiday themes and classics such as Cinderella that are appropriate an d fun for children to perform.

",How to Direct Readers' Theatre2," This step is important as it lets people know what you're doing and to come and join in. Before you advertise, it's a good idea to have a catchy name and descriptive phrase and a distinctive graphic design for your Theatre's name. Use colors that stand out, to grab people's attention. And have an email address and phone number ready for taking messages so that these can be included with the advertising materials. It's a good idea to encourage people to join early, so that you can begin to get an idea of numbers; to this end, try to include an early joining incentive as part of your advertising, such as a discount, if you're charging fees or an extra ticket for family for the final show. Some ways to advertise include:


A good way to advertise is to get a magnetic giant sticker with your organization's name, phone number and your goal for actors (short, like a catchy motto), and put it on your car. Every time you drive, people will see it.

Put a classified ad in the newspaper. It will cost a little more, but a lot of people may see it. Ask whether this is also repeated in the online version of the newspaper––classifieds often are now.
Get picket signs with your key information printed on them and put them up around town (with permission) to advertise.
Make small posters and flyers. Place these in strategic locations like local shop windows (ask first), library bulletin boards, school message boards, washateria board, church boards, etc. Wherever people gather in a community space is a good place to advertise.
Set up a Twitter and Facebook account. Share the links with friends and ask them to pass it on. Leave useful information on both accounts and update regularly to keep people noticing your presence.

,"
"
Get everything ready.,
Consider using short stories for creating your scripts as with books, to make a series of plays to create a diversity of roles for the people who turn up; this will also allow you to place people into different groups by story.,
Get your practice place ready.,
Keep a list of people who have said they'll come and any details such as email contact or phone number.,
Meet the first day: Start the theatre, having the scripts handy, along with the extras for unexpected participants and for those who forget.,
Once everyone has had a chance to audition, give each of them their script with their name marked on it.,
Decide which play you're going to practice first (if you have more than one).",How to Direct Readers' Theatre3," Preparation is a large part of running a theatre and directing actors. Your own confidence will stem from making sure that you have everything that's needed to keep each practice running smoothly. Some things you'll need to prepare include:



Make your script. Reader's Theatre is essentially about selecting a book to either (1) type out part of it from the book -- or (2), instead, copy and paste parts of the text, if you find a book on line that will work that way (some are not in text form). Then (3) organize that into a play-script format. It will take you a while, but that's what you would have to do -- unless someone has made some scripts already that you can borrow or download and use.

,


Print out your scripts and staple them.
Print 10 extra scripts above what you think you'd regularly need. Someone will always forget his or her script and newcomers may turn up when you least expect it.
Get together anything else needed, such as a portable music player and music playlist, highlighters for the scripts, water and cups for refreshing parched throats, etc.

, It should be an open space with chairs surrounding the area. If you can, put a few mirrors on the walls. It will help the actors practice their facial expressions and posture, allowing them to make changes as needed when their actions are reflected back at them. Affordable portable mirrors can often be found in thrift stores; they don't need to be beautiful, just functional.

, Be ready to field queries from interested people by having all the details sorted in your mind; this will help you to sound professional and will encourage them to join in. If you've done everything listed above, then all you need is the actors and to wait for the day you set.


If you've made electronic copies of the script, you might consider emailing this to interested people before they turn up. You can make it clear that you'll provide paper copies but this lets them get a head start on understanding the script.
Send confirmation details by email or mail to those who ""enroll"" or ""join"" the Readers' Theatre. This helps to create a sense of belonging and encourages turning up. Use this opportunity to ask them to friend you on Facebook and follow you on Twitter as well.

,
Have everyone stand in a circle and give them each a script. Explain what you will be doing and ""audition"" people for the parts. Always have the actors warm up.Teach the actors to use their big voice, not the small ""3 foot (0.9 m) voice"" which is used in classroom group work.



Teach and insist on safety, in all aspects. Teach your 5 or 6 rules and instruct new procedures anytime, as needed.
Keep a clipboard handy. Write or print out each person's name and put a little box next to it. Have each actor read the parts you're thinking they would be good for. If they meet your expectations, put an ""x"" for ""good"" next to their name; if not, then put an '*' and move on to the next person. Using the asterisk, ""*"", is not such an obvious bad-mark and using ""x as the good-mark"" lessens the set notions of being judged...

If you have more than two plays (or books/short stories), this will ensure that everyone gets a part; and a second chance if they weren't what you were looking for when they did their first audition.
If you're auditioning children, be more forgiving about who seems ""right"" for a role. The purpose of acting for children is to learn how to grow into the roles and to improve in time. Indeed, acting often teaches children confidence and resilience, and giving them a chance to prove themselves will often surprise you (and their parents)!


If you have a person who auditions and seems totally unsuitable for any part, try to find this person something else to do to keep them involved. Part of a director's role, especially with passionate performers, is to make sure that those keen to take part have something they can do. Take into account the fact that just by turning up, such a person showed enthusiasm and you might give them a chance to be an understudy, manager of props or chief usher at the show, etc.

, Make a plan to meet back at the chosen location on the set dates.


Be on time to unlock the building; it's a good idea to be there about 30 minutes before anyone is supposed to arrive. If you're using a set of any kind, and/or properties (props), put these in place so that the ""stage"" is set when your actors arrive.

If you have no set, then use chairs or crates to form a basic set.


When people arrive, have them sit and encourage them to practice their lines.

, If one play doesn't involve certain people, have your assistant take them to a separate area to practice their lines (and do character work) while you're working on the current play. Alternatively, if it's just the one play, have those not in a particular scene break off and practice something different with the assistant director.


Learn how to critique acting. If you see something you think could be fixed, then tell the actors kindly. This is where your directing instinct should kick in. It will take some practice to perfect your own style but provided you let the actors know you're learning and that you're open to being taught too, this is a fine opportunity to hone your directing skills.
Always assume that you're working with people who want to achieve their best and focus on praising the results you want and downplaying the things you don't want from them.
Spend some time reading about directors and directing skills to get good suggestions for improving your own techniques.
Don't be hesitant about explaining what you'd prefer an actor to do. Acting is about being ready to conform to the expectations of people who have some distance and can see what is needed; the actor is in the middle of the action -- but as a director, you're able to see the bigger picture, and it is important that you learn to convey this professionally and clearly.
It can sometimes help to video people as they act. Email them the video after the practice session with pointers for making changes. Having actors able to see themselves in the privacy of their own homes and digest the constructive feedback you've offered should see them return with renewed vigor!

When you think your actors are ready, set a show date.,
Find a venue.,
Decide whether you want to make it a full ""Theatre"" experience.,
Hold your show.",How to Direct Readers' Theatre4," Choose the middle of the week or a weekend. Evenings are good for adults, matinees (late morning or early afternoon) for children. In some cases, especially with children, it might be sensible to use the same time as the practice time, as parents will be more likely to have this time set aside in their calendars.


Be sure to ask your actors first if they're happy to perform a show. If they have understood this to be the outcome of all their hard work from the start, then it'll be easy to get them to perform. On the other hand, if your group has never acted before and was only interested in learning the skills, it's important to ask whether they want to put their skills on public display before assuming that this is what they expected. Talking about holding a show from the very start of the practice sessions is recommended as a way to know from the beginning how your actors feel.

, Your practice place may not be suitable for holding the actual show; if not, you'll need to look for a suitable one, hopefully with a stage. If you can get a church to help sponsor you, or a school with a stage, it would be easier on the pocketbook.


Make sure your venue has good lighting, curtains and a bathroom. If you can get tables and chairs for seating, that would be the most comfortable for your audience.
If you want to make it more enjoyable for your audience, serve snacks or a dessert. You'll probably have to charge admission for this, but it will draw more people in. Alternatively, if you're keeping this part very informal and only inviting the friends and families of those participating, ask them to bring a plate for a shared supper. This saves costs and brings everyone together after the show.
Set a time and date and advertise. Get custom made tickets and printed programs for your show. Put another classified ad in the newspaper promoting it and encourage people to share links online through sites such as Facebook and Twitter. For advertising, be sure to include the show's name, the time and date, the location, and if you have passable actors, add a ""Featuring"" to it, listing the cast.

, If so, include makeup and full costumes for the actors. Given you're most likely on a budget, ask the actors to assist here by bringing their own costume skills to the task. Thrift stores and online auctions are other great places to find cheap costume items. Don't be afraid to experiment with all sorts of things and to use simple sewing, gluing and stapling to achieve the looks needed––nobody will be looking too closely.


If you're directing children, parents and grandparents are often only too happy to pitch in and help with costume and makeup skills. Ask nicely and some parents or grandparents are likely to come forward, and if you're really blessed, you can assign the most enthusiastic one with a title like ""Head of Costumes"" -- and he or she will take charge for you. This may also work for adult actors, if you work out who is most keen in the costume, creative department!

, Make sure the actors are ready, the venue is ready and everything is looking good. If you only have small props or costume pieces (like hats, scarves, shoes), then use those rather than full costumes. It's a good idea to have some friends help out with the last minute setting up and with ushering in the audience. You can't expect the actors to be involved in this part. Perhaps also ask former colleagues from your old acting school to come and lend a hand; it's all good experience and fun for them.


Hand out programs to people at the doors. Take their money/ticket and have them go in.
Have music playing in the background. Ensure that the music is free to be played in public; if unsure, stick to music that has clearance for playing in public (even old songs may have copyright on the arrangements).
Dim the audience/house lights and start the show!

During the first introduction the narrator would always begin each introduction with ""these three contestants are about to play the most exciting game of their lives which only one of them could win."" He'd continue to describe the players and then finish The narrator would continue ""From Television City in Hollywood, it's time to Press Your Luck."" The board would be set in motion, and is in the same sequence of tiles and prizes from the final Big Board round (as described below) and you see the turntable holding the contestants begin to turn to face the cameras. It would end with ""And now here's your host Peter Tomarken."" On others, the narrator would talk use the ultimate in phrases when trying to describe the game; he'd use ""but you'll have to avoid the Whammy"" (but the pitch of the phrase would be quite chaotic as the pitch of the voice would begin to increase (instead of stay roughly the same as the pitch is supposed to do with the word ""Whammy"").


During seasons following Michael Larson's famous episode, the visuals would begin with repeats from past shows showing exciting spins from the Big Board round (generally from the second of the two Big Board rounds) which would result in this quote. ""Today, these three contestants are out for Big(the narrator would hold this word to elongate the word a bit) Bucks, but they'll have to avoid the Whammy as they play the most exciting game of their lives. From Television City in Hollywood, it's time to Press Your Luck. And now, here's your host the star of Press Your Luck, Peter Tomarken. The turntable would begin turning as this quote is being said.

The narrator would talk use the ultimate in phrases when trying to describe the game; when he'd use ""but they'll have to avoid the Whammy"", the pitch of the phrase would be quite chaotic as the pitch of the voice would begin to increase (instead of stay roughly the same as the pitch is supposed to do with the word ""Whammy"".

;
, This will be described below.

, To earn spins on the ""Big Board"", 3 players always had to answer a series of 5 questions. Being the first person to guess (and guess right) earned the player 3 spins. The other players then had a chance to pick up 1 spin, by solving a multiple choice question. If no one was able to answer the question during the open question portion, 1 spin could be awarded to each contestant to correctly answer the question from the host's 3 possible answers., Play the ""Big Board"" after obtaining the amount of spins you answered. Each player would stop the board using a button/plunger and generally yelling ""stop"". Each space would be filled with various prizes of money and changed every few seconds. Sometimes, the board would be filled with something contestants didn't want (called a Whammy!) If they picked up 4 Whammies, they'd be out of the game. 2 Whammies just in the first round would signal the host to remind them that they are really living on the edge if they picked up another Whammy in the First Round.

If the player wants to avoid the Whammy at any time and has money, the player could pass their remaining spins to the player who has more money accumulated. However, the player who obtains them, must play them without re-passing them to someone else; if they pick up a Whammy and still have other spins passed to them, these spins become accumulated spins that they can then pass to others, but they (like other Whammies) lose all their money they accumulated in turn. (If you continue watching the show, you'll see that this carried over into the second Big Board round.)
Landing on ""Big Bucks"" will generally pick the contestant the highest amount of money on the Board. This space is only played in the Second Big Board round and can be located in only one space fluctuating between it and a Whammy space.
Some spaces, including the highest cash values in the Second Big Board round, gives the player an extra spin along with the cash value.
The player, at the end of the game, who has the most money accumulated wins the game, their cash, and all their prizes after (any Whammies). (Whammies can wipe out all prizes obtained too.)
Recognize that 4 Whammies would completely halt your game play and force you out of the game, losing any cash, prizes and remaining spins you may have obtained to oblivion up to that time. This page lists almost all the Whammies that were incurred during its original Press Your Luck seasons.
There was a square on the left side of the Big Board that was money+1 spin that never changed(with the exception of the money value)

, Although much of the game got replicated in the second round, in terms of Big Board round, a ""Big Bucks+1 spin"" square that never moved was added and things were a little different the second time around., The board had several squares that constantly changed. It had money squares, money+a spin squares, move a space squares, special prize squares, and the ultimate Whammy squares. In the 2002 rendition (as you'll later see) a Double Whammy square could be spotted in the board which was more randomized and players couldn't master a pattern (unlike Michael Larson who memorized the pattern and won the Big Bucks in the ""Big Bucks Scandal""., Players sat at chairs on a turntable that turned to face the players towards the away from the big Board during the Question round and towards the Big Board when the Big Board round came up. The players would be (what seemed like) above the host of the show(described later) (although this differed when the second iteration of Press Your Luck appeared in 2002 when players were found standing at individual podiums that were found at floor height that were static (as will be partially described later)., followed later by a screamed ""Stop!""(as you see the player press down their plunger button).

,


Understand the types of squares on the big board. Although the board had plenty of spaces where there would be just cash, there were also squares where there would be cash and a spin, a prize...but, there was also a space that would be up on the board called the Whammy. Although he was an evil creature, he was generally red colored and always had a smile only other villains could love.

,


Michael Larsen's epic episode had to actually be split into two complete episodes which aired on 6/8/1984 and 6/11/1984. Michael Larsen supposedly memorized every game board sequence, and ended up picking up over $100,000 US in cash during the show (picking up only 1 Whammy in the first round and none in the second). He was the only player who wasn't asked to return again in following shows and set a new precedent for most money a person can accumulate in one show which was no more than $75,000 US. It also led the producers of the show to add more sequences to the board, so cheating scandals couldn't happen thereafter.In 2003, GSN/Game Show Network aired a documentary called ""Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal"" about his episodes.The epic spin-battle episode also was a major episode for Press Your Luck fans. Two players during one of the rounds sent their spins back and forth, until it became a big ""ping pong"" match.The one time that all three players were asked to return the second day only happened once after all players ended at 0 and the last spin between two players resulted in a Whammy (thereby leading every player to a 0 dollar balance). Look for an episode starring Dorothy, Wayne and Joe. It originally aired February 3, 1986. .
Several would be celebrities also made their appearance on the show including Myke Horton who was the Gladiator named Gemini from the former 1990's version of American Gladiators as well as an Jenny Jones, Randy West (who would later become an announcer for Press Your Luck), Karen Martin, Steve Bryant, Ralph Strangis, Sam Schmidt, Gene Snyder, and several others., All good shows came to a close after awhile. After 758 episodes were taped and shown, Press Your Luck was off the air following the September 26,1986 episode. It was replaced many years later by a game show called just ""Whammy"" or ""Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck"" (which only ran 130 episodes).


The new game show had some differences. Not only will some Whammies on the board mess with your mind a little (by throwing down weird things such as confetti, cotton, or a mess of other things), the board wasn't rectangular in design and was definitely more randomized than the former incarnation. Its other major difference was the way the question rounds were formed. The first round wasn't questions. Players spun the board until they Whammied out the first time, the last player could Freeze and hold, or, if the other players wanted to not risk the Whammy at any time, they too could Freeze, but stop playing. Every few spins, the stakes got bigger as the host asked to add additional Whammies to the board.

, Watching some of the shows, you'll see a mess of Whammies show up and wipe money off the board during a spin.

, Press Your Luck was shown from September 19, 1983 to September 26,1986 for a total of 758 episodes (These episodes occurred two days a week, though some television shows tend to promote the fact that these episodes were aired on a daily schedule (except for the weekends.).) Its much later version (just called Whammy) ran from April 15, 2002 to December 5, 2003 and lasted only 130 episodes.


Press Your Luck ran its shows on both CBS and later in reruns on USA Network. In 2006, during one episode of ""Gameshow Marathon"", this game was played with celebrity contestants for one episode only using the original format of the game. . Today, all shows of both Press Your Luck and all shows of Whammy are syndicated on GSN/Game Show Network and BUZZR for the viewing public (including the Michael Larsen episode which comes every few years-with the last time seen on July 31,2016 and one week later on BUZZR as an hour long special).

, Pick up the most money at the end of the game was always the objective of playing the game, while not picking up enough Whammies to stop your game play.

, Peter Tomarken (who died in March 2006 during a plane crash) was a game show host of many game shows, but of which Press Your Luck was by far his most-remembered game show host position by most fans.Recognize that the later Whammy episode had a new host who was Todd Newton. Because of its short lasting period, Todd Newton is still well unrecognized in this world today.

, Rod Roddy (who later became the announcer for The Price is Right during the Bob Barker episodes) was really a comedian when it came to announcing games. He sometimes wasn't able to make it and had to be substituted for two other less-known names (John Harlan and Charlie O'Donnell) who weren't as comedic as the announcer.The much later Whammy had Gary Kroeger announcing its episodes.

, Although there was one holiday episode, every year the game would have slightly different motifs for different seasons.

The announcer (who you'll get to know a little later on) said ""Behind this door is the Video Zone. A place between our world and the video dimension waiting to challenge you to control is one of the game wizards."" The announcer then introduced the game wizards who flew out through computer animation (more on this later). The announcer generally said ""Is it Merlock, Scorchia or Mongo?"" These game wizards looked brutal and ""ready to fight"".



 


The video then switched to each of the teams. The announcer would say, ""These two teams will compete for the right to enter the Video Zone and face that game wizard's challenge."" The camera angle would switch to zoom out to show both teams standing on stage. The announcer would then say ""Who will it be? Find out today on Nick Arcade"". A splash screen affect would happen on the screen.
They'd then transition into introducing the host ""And here's your host...Phil Moore."" Each episode, they used a different amusing but inaccurate statement to describe the host, such as ""a host with a memory bank that has it's own checking account."" As the host danced in, behind him you'd see the Face-off game that would enter on an in-game stage pulley (more on this a little later).;
, Over a themed game board, teams would move Mikey around a virtual world, having to answer questions as they went, encountering the occasional puzzle, and sometimes playing a video game in the Video Challenge area (when the team revealed that square). Teams were awarded points for winning rounds. They generally played 2 rounds of the board. The team with the most points went on to the bonus round - which they called the Video Zone and played to defeat the Game Wizard of the day. Once they defeated the game wizard, they would win the game and the money and prizes on offer., Be able to explain some of the Face-Off games that were used in the Face-Off at the beginning of each of the rounds. Face-Off games included Meteoroids, Laser Surgeon, Brainstorm, Battle of the Bands, Star Defenders, Post-Haste, Jet Jocks or Crater Rangers.One of the two players of each team would face off against each other at a arcade-style video game that came out. The game lasted 30 seconds. The winner would be awarded points and control of Mikey on the video board., Teams would navigate Mikey along a given path (as described below). They could move Mikey up, down, left or right (never diagonally). Each square triggered an event such as a puzzle to solve, a point square a prize square, an enemy that would take the control away from the team that was navigating at the time or through a Video Challenge that would send the team into the Video Challenge area of the stage. They would try to get Mikey to the Goal square. There were two rounds, and during the second round point values were doubled. The game ended when the team who had the most points after the two rounds were achieved. If the game tried to end in a tie, an additional tiebreaker question was asked (100 points). The Video Zone bonus round awaited the winner of the Main round.



If the team had to end up in the Video Challenge area, both team members had to walk over to the area (and most often this would take up a few extra seconds of taped time to show the viewer). One player was chosen to write down how many of their points they'd like to wager, should their team loose in the challenge. Video games were played and teams must reach certain levels set by the production company, but each game was different. If they accomplished or beat the score, they'd keep control of Mikey and win additional points. Most of the video games lasted about 30 seconds (though some could take up to 60 seconds).



, Video Challenges included games that were used on Nintendo Entertainment Systems, Super Nintendo, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, Neo-Geo and other custom games from Amiga computers. By watching a show, you'd see that there would be only five of these systems set up in one corner of the stage in back of the host's desk and the Mikey TV screen system. The goal generally of the Video Challenge was to beat the wizard and achieve a certain score within 30 seconds for the given game. At first the team member had three seconds to wager a score they would gamble on onto a Magna-Doodle that their partner could complete the challenge. Wagers could be any amount as long as the team had banked the point values they are wagering. Games could only be played once per episode. Although few games were well known from this area, games such as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Super Mario Brothers 2-3 were played, along with other lesser-known games.

What the kids and audience saw were actually two games that acted concurrently with each other. The game would act the same but the actions would be split among the two consoles that were playing the same game. Games were cued up and paused where the game was to begin. At the beginning, the producers just switched the display onto the monitor and used the stock controllers for gameplay.

, This round was a bonus round that featured some live action video game with multiple levels and multiple games. Contestants would watch themselves on a backstage stage as they climbed ladders and threw virtual snowballs and rowed in a boat in front of a blue screen/green screen effect to obtain three desired objects for each level of the game. However, they had to avoid damage by various hazards and enemies. The stage would be restarted if they lost all their power, and the level would be restarted until they were successful. Periodically, a power-up would appear and when touched would destroy all onscreen enemies and freezing enemies that might be waiting to come on for 5 seconds and restoring the team's power meter to full. If the teams got through all three levels in 60 seconds, they would win the game. A successful completion of defeating the Game Wizard would give the teams the grand prize vacation. If teams didn't finish, a sound played the screen faded to red and ""Game over"" appeared on the TV screen.

Over the course of both seasons, level one contained one of five choices and included Jungle Fever, Alien Moonbase, Ancient Tomb, Monsters on the Loose or the Haunted Museum.
Over the course of both seasons, level two contained one of eight choices and included Runaway Rail Car, Nile River Raft, Mine Maze, Cliffhanger, Food Fight, Sub Search, Enchanted Flight, or Snow Slingers.

Level 3 got interesting. Both teammates entered to face one of the three Game Wizards that rotated. Merlock threw lightning bolts at players, Scorchia threw fireballs at players and Mongo tossed balls of bad energy at players. Three orbs had to be activated before the time elapsed, without touching the projectiles the Wizards were throwing or the lightning, fire or energy that erupted from the ground, and also trying to avoid the ghosts that routinely flew around the room. Touching the hourglass would freeze the enemies projectiles for a period of five seconds. Defeat of the Wizard would show a virtual entertainment piece to those show-watchers (Merlock disintegrated to dust, Scorchia's body burned to ashes, and Mongo would just vanish into thin air over a flash of light, leaving his armor behind.)



, Watch the program to understand everything about Mikey and his Video Board. The Video board was used in this game to mark the Mikey's path to get from his initial spot to the goal line. This 18-box square board (it was 3x6 boxes) was filled with many milestones, including a Points square that gave 25 or 50 points to the team that landed on it and a Puzzle square that required an answer from one of several different puzzles (such as the Video Repairman, What Was That, Credit Crawl, Fast Forward, Robot Vision, HyperChannels, Video Text, Flash Frame, Hidden Camera, Instant Replay, Split Screen or Mixed Signals). Pop quiz squares required answering a question to a quiz-styled question to earn points or one of many prizes. These four would always be designated as the ""Four P's"". Also included was a Video Challenge and enemy squares to which had multiple results; Video Challenge would get the players into the Video Zone area to play one of the games, while enemy was a loss of your turn square.

Players who chose to move Mikey into squares he'd already have been in would result in a Time Bomb square. This didn't happen often. The team who chose to backtrack Mikey into one of these squares had to quickly spell a word (in 10 seconds) alternating back and forth between the two players. Correctly-spelled words would allow the team to regain control of Mikey and hope to move forward. Only one episode had teams moving into Time Bomb territory in the same episode..
Goal squares were the ending square the teams must aim for and reach. Rarely did it ever happen that teams reached this square on their own accord. Most often, Mikey was forwarded to this square due as time ran out on the show.

If the team reached this square on their own accord, a question was asked based on a category that the opposing team had to choose for the team that reached the square. They received 50 points (Round 1) or 100 points (Round 2) and the Goal for that round. If they answered incorrectly, the opposing team claimed half the points.
If the team ran out of time, there was a sudden death Pop Quiz question asked and the teams won the same 50 points or 100 points total.



, Mikey's world was the area of exploration on the video monitor gameboard. The computer would choose between the Pirates Cove, Cape Cosmos, Camelittle, Specific Ocean, Forgotten Desert, Slurpy Gulch, Volcano Jungle, Creepyville, Mikey's Neighborhood, WeGot'Em Mall or a Time Portal scene., Although each episode involved different enemies (and some episodes didn't feature any due to the player's path to the goal), among them Mikey could encounter characters called either Ghost, Witch Doctor, Fire-Breathing Dragon, Hammerhead Shark, Blackboard the Pirate, Silly the Kid, Game Over-the Town Bully, Giant Smooch Aliens, or Djinni. Each of these tried to stay consistent to the area Mikey was walking around in., Phil Moore hosted this show during its airing. This was his first major attempt at hosting a gameshow. Before becoming the host of this show, he had been an actor in a drama film called ""After School"", and he went on to star in other Nickelodeon shows, including Weinerville, All That, Figure it Out, You're On and had been on Aqua Kids. He lasted through both of the two seasons that this show was aired on. (More on this schedule later in this article)., Nick Arcade was narrated by Andrea Lively.Andrea Lively also had helped with the movie ""Superboy"" and, years after this, was a guest on the TV show Holy ManThis was her only major announcing role., Throughout the casting of the show, it wasn't just teams that didn't know each other facing off against each other. They had a few specials where teams from Clarissa Explains it All, Salute Your Shorts and Welcome Freshmen had played. With the exception of the Salute Your Shorts Episode, both of the two teams were able to enter the Video Zone., Nickelodeon Arcade aired on Nickelodeon between January 4 and November 6, 1992, over the course of 2 seasons for a total of 84 episodes.. It generally aired during a 5pm block of time for a running time of 30 minutes per show.

It also aired in Mexico under the title ""Zona De Juegos"" between 1995 and 2007., Players would generally wear two t-shirts (one over the other). One long-sleeve t-shirt designated their team color (either red or yellow) and the other t-shirt was short-sleeve, grey, had a tape-styled (yellow with a black border) name tag on the right side of the shirt and a logo on the left. However, once they entered the Video Zone, their shirts wouldn't be seen, and they'd be wearing brown with arm bands of their team's color, as well as knee pads and long-pants with team-colored gloves., Each team consisted of team players, and there were two teams: one team of red and one team of yellow., There were two to three areas where teams could be in when playing parts of the game.

The place where teams answered the questions almost always had spaceship and futuristic themes, with player podiums being grey. They were bordered by an aqua-colored filled border piece. Players at these podiums pressed a button on a one-buttoned joystick like device when they wanted to answer the question. Inside the front of the podium (below the team's desk slightly) was displayed the score which was colored to match the team colors. Also, seen on the desk were two wired microphones for contestants that were leaning at an angle in response to the player's needs.

Each podium had a light below the scoreboard, over on the right hand side were two lights: bluish-green and red. These lights designated which team had control of Mikey on the Video Board.


In back of the team was a lightboard with the color matching the team's color, breaking at the halfway point. There was a logo at the halfway point and extending on either side of the team's lightboard. The two together looked like a gigantic Illuminati symbol that split in half by a separator. When looking at it from in front, the yellow team was on the left and the red team was on the right. Also, covering areas of the wall next to these symbols and player podiums, was a leopard-printed decoration that was shown on both sides of the podiums.
In front of the player podiums, the players would notice a painted line on the floor that looked like a giant lightning bolt. This area extended from the doors that opened that brought players into the Video Zone out as far as the camera could see. Also, on this line, you couldn't tell, but down this same strip was where the videos from the Face-Off would travel down through.
In front, facing the contestants, was the host's podium, as well as the TV monitors that looked a bit like a bigger version of the video game podiums used in the Video Challenges area. Next to this was a gigantic open area where players would walk when they needed to report for a Video Challenge question.
In back of the host's podium and where the host stood and when the camera focused on this area, was the area where the Video Challenge questions were completed. Here, the theming was less towards the video games and more splash-screen like. On the floor, you'd see splashes of what looked like paint that were unique to this show, along with arrows pointing towards the games themselves. In the second season, the theming here was completely dropped in favor of a blue colored bar with numbers inside circles designating the video machine the team was playing.
Once you got back to your contestant podium and were looking to your left towards the doors that opened to the Video Zone, you'd see gigantic doors that looked like there was a crack in them where the doors opened and split when players were able to enter.
A common color along the stageline here was blue. The production company loved this color because it was so futuristic and vibrant. It was used in multiple areas of the stage; wherever you looked would be something in this bluish color.

, Most often, the host would run some impromptu lyrics behind the music when players were walking over to the Video Challenges area (and sometimes on the way back). It had no real lyrics, but sounded very techie and upbeat, and definitely matched the theme of this Nickelodeon TV game show."

Apply stage makeup first;
,
Before doing anything else, use a makeup chart to plan where you are going to put the hair; this is especially important if you are using it alongside other makeup effects.,
Once you have figured out where the hair goes, you have two options for sticking the hair to the skin: liquid latex or spirit gum.,
Cut a straight bundled edge of crepe hair, hold between forefinger and thumb.,
Continue under chin until desired effect.

,
Start with upper chin and continue to lay hair down towards floor.

,Work up into sideburns if needed

,
Continue onto the mustache .,
I would recommend only using spirit gum...which can be removed with 91% alcohol (CVS-carries this)liquid latex takes a long time to dry and not as effective.

,
Allow Spirit gum to get tacky, use finger and tap till it feels like molasses.

,
Cut into desired shape, style.

",How to Apply Crepe Hair,", One important thing to keep in mind (which many beginners forget) is the bone structure beneath the skin. This is important if the hair is going on the face; it's not as vital in other areas, but it's still good to keep in mind.

, Whichever you choose, apply a thin layer to the area.

, Squeeze and roll fingers against each other to ""fan"" out creped hair. Then apply in small 1/2 sections or smaller starting with under the chin facing forward(towards the mirror). Place only the tip of the spread cut edges.

,,,, outer sides of mustache need to face a a 45 degree angle facing down, then proceed to the nasolabial cleft (the divot underneath nose cartilage) place hair to go directly down.

Then all of a sudden the reason for the show (the words ""Do You Have It?"") flashed onscreen, much like a synthesizer echoed several times. There were several different clips of previous contestants trying all sorts of the Nick Guts games, while the them music yelled, ""Guts"". The camera then showed a panoramic view of the Extreme Arena as we heard the host introduce us to the area and game show ""From Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando Florida, welcome to Guts - the action sports show that's gonna make you sweat!"". Each player was introduced, as most post players waltzed out onto the area of the infield near the one side of the track (with the Crag in the far distance). The host always referred to each contestant with a name-nickname pair in this part of the show. In an almost-screamed yell, the host introduced himself ""Hello everyone. I'm (host name mentioned later). Welcome to the Extreme Arena - home of Nickelodeon Guts: the action sports show where kids live out their greatest sports fantasies. Today, players will be battling their way through four outrageous events and after that, they'll get a chance to tackle our Radical Rock - the Agro Crag, where almost anything can happen. The player with the most points at the end of all of our events is our winner and he or she will be able to take home a piece of our Radical Rock."" The host reminds the viewer how well events will be monitored for safety and the first game is introduced without much detail from the splash on the screen (which differed slightly by season). He'd then say, ""Let's go to (announcer's name) for the rules!"" The announcer announced the description and rules of the game. And the games began - most often with a whistle.

During seasons 2 and 3, the introductory segment saw some changes. At the very beginning, players were introduced right away ""Can (name) or (name) or (name) battle out..."" (even before the theme song began). The players didn't waltz out -players didn't enter into the ""Extreme Arena"" as they did in all the other seasons. The music got shorter, and the host introduced the first game almost right away. This season got ""right to the point,"" and as you'll see later, it introduced a change to the Crag, too. The host simplified his wording in this season down to just ""I'm (host's name described later). This is Nickelodeon Guts. Do You Have It?"" The audience would scream ""Guts"", then the shortened-introductory video took over before the contestants jumped into the first game.
During season 4 (when Nickelodeon Guts changed to ""Global Guts""), this introduction was revised yet again. The video feed showed kids having just general fun, running wild all over wide open pastures and even a zoomed-in camera shot that passed by a world-famous bridge and finally in on the Nickelodeon Studios building in cartoon style. The introductory wording was revamped as the words ""Do You Have It?"" were literally splashed onto the screen. Players entered the Extreme Arena again (unlike season 2 and 3). The paragraph describing the show was reworked to: ""They've come from all over the world with one goal - a glowing piece of our Radical Rock. But one question still remains - 'Do You Have It?'"" Then a few moments later the host would say, ""Welcome to the Extreme Arena at Nickelodeon Studios. This is Global Guts - Nickelodeon's world championship for kids. Let's meet today's players."";
, A set of four ""extreme games"" comprised the show's structure. All three players battled head-to-head in four events; whoever won the event placed in first place. The other players collected second and third place. If one team tied with another, both teams got the same points for their event. During each show, contestants got three hundred points for placing in first place, two hundred points for placing in second place and one hundred points for placing in third place. Each game consisted of challenges players had to endure to get them through from beginning to end. These games will be discussed later but ranged from having players playing ""jump ball"" (a jazzed-up and extreme version of basketball) to having them surf using a surfboard/ski to race from end-to-end in the arena.

Games were set inside this soundstage in a gymnasium-like setting but often used equipment you wouldn't expect.

, The Crag would generally mark the very end of the game. Utilizing an elastic cord, players had to climb a mountain that was anywhere between 28-30 feet tall.As players climbed, they would have to have had to push button actuators that set off lights that strobed around in a circle (including a final actuator at the very top). But as they were making their way to the top, things such as ""boulders"" (season 1), which were heavier-weight Styrofoam rock-like masses, or confetti/falling snow (season 2) came falling down onto the contestants. Sometimes, players' actions triggered these obstacles, while others were taken by the stage crew. Players had to climb only their side of the mountain and could not disrupt another player's progress. They were penalized if they hit someone else's actuator (even accidental hits) or if they reached the top by grabbing a hand rail that was seen (more often in seasons 2 and 3). Strobe light lightning flashes were also seen at times. Players climbed what looked like large stereo speakers that sent lots of mist spewing everywhere. Colored lights were illuminated along the entire length of the mountain; these teams' colors designated to the player which path up the Crag to use. The Crag gave 725 points to the team that came in first, 550 points to the team that came in second and 375 points to the team who came in third.The Crag went through many different variations in its names, and each different variation went through different redesign changes. During season 1, the Crag was called just the ""Aggro Crag"". By season 2, the Crag was called the ""Mega Crag"" (though in Wikipedia's article they said it was called the Aggro Crag for this season as well). By the time Global Guts came into town, the Crag became the ""Super Aggro Crag"".Players could also be penalized for not stepping on all of the ""boulders"" at the base of the Crag, called ""Boulder Canyon"", or climbing without lighting all of the team's own actuators (though this didn't happen very often).

, At the very end of the game, there was a medals ceremony. The total numbers of points for each team were tallied (including the points received on the Crag) and players stood on a pedestal. Dependent on standing, players either received a gold (for first place finish), silver (for second place finish) or platinum (for third place finish) medal, as well as that much-coveted glowing piece of the Crag (""glowing piece of the Radical Rock"") that went to the day's first place winner. The rock would generally glow green and was like a trophy for the team.

Players weren't given trips to Universal after the show (unlike it's other Nickelodeon game shows), but they were able to keep the sneakers and contestant shirt they were given on the show. All other safety equipment had to be returned to Nickelodeon by the end of their studio day.

, Obviously, the ""Do You Have it?"" motto was well defined, and these are the only words you'll hear over and over and over again in seasons 1 and 4, there were no other lyrics heard, unlike all the other seasons. In seasons 2 and 3, the lyrics were short but contained four sentences spoken by one person (that were a set of two conditions and two questions about the games the players will be playing in the game).



""It takes a certain kind of person to get the party rollin' to the level of precision that's needed to get risen to the top. Do you have it?""
""It takes a certain kind of something to keep your heart pumpin' that everyone needs to achieve to succeed - you'll need a lot! Do you have it?""



, The Spill Your Guts segment was a segue that was meant to introduce the players, just before programming switched to the advertisements during the show. For season 1 and 2, the host or referee/announcer would introduce the player and this would be an interview between the two. But as season 3 went on the air, the players introduced themselves. As you'll see later in this article, when this show changed to Global Guts (for the very last season), for players who came from non-English speaking countries, they had an interpreter speak overtop of their voice in the United States version of Global Guts., Producers came up with nicknames for each of the contestants on this show and for each contestant that came in, the host would mention the name-nickname pair (including the players' last name). However, few times did this ever make much sense, and the origin of the nickname was a mystery to viewers. Similar to the stylings of the nickname of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen on Back to the Future Part III, most players got something fitting that set in with notoriety but not much else., Beginning in season 2, after the first two games were played and the second player had spilt their guts, the host and announcer would summarize what the viewers had seen. It would end with a look back at the first half of the show and after a short commentary, the host would remind the announcer of her job duties as referee and ask that she return before he ended up finishing his spiel., This game had many games that were used over its four season run, which were categorized as either a field, aerial, gym, track, pool, or mountain (for the one game). Both the type of game and the name of the game would be displayed on a splash screen page prior to the rules being introduced. These games included Aces, Attack, Basic Training, Blade Runner, Blast It, Boogie Down, Bull's Eye, Crag/Agro Crag/Super Agro Crag/Mega Crag/etc., Dodge It, Double Play, Eat My Dust, Extreme Baseball, Free Kick, Fumble/Rugby/Scrumble, Hang Ten, Invisible Boat, Jump Ball, Jump!Jump!, Mad Max, Make Your Mark, Moon Race, Off the Wall, Over the Top, Peak to Peak, Power Ski, Rebound, Shoot Out, Skurfin Safari, Skyball, Slam Dunk, Slam-a-Jama, Slap Shot, Spike It, Spin Out, Spirals, Splash Down, The Edge, The Longest Yard, Totally Tubular, Touchdown, Triple Jump, Vertiboggan, Wave Runner, White Water, Wild Pitch, Wild Wheels, or Zero G. Although there were many game options, four different games were used on each show, as well as the Crag segment at the end. Sometimes pool events would be selected over aerial but this depended on the exact episode. All episodes had the mountain game (Crag) in it, no matter what!, The events took place in Soundstage 21 of Nickelodeon Studios in an arena which the crew called the ""Extreme Arena"". Any viewer and fan knew what this place looked like. There was an area near the very front that was covered in the mountain. In back of the mountain, there was a track and field-like area that had a track. Inside the track, there were other areas and obstacles that were used for the shows, such as the wave pool for pool/aquatic events, as well as high jump and similar objects devoted to aerial events. On each side nearest the track and field was the audience (on both the straightaways and near the curves). For season 4 when Nickelodeon Guts changed to Global Guts, the set also included a fake set of country representatives, who were in hockey-like penalty boxes and were shown near the introduction conversing over the phone., Team colors never varied over the course of the four seasons of the show. Although each team consisted of only one player, colors included blue, red and purple. However, sometimes blue looked more like an aqua or greenish color on some TV screens., Players wore rather long jerseys and yellow helmets. For aerial events, players were mandated to use harnesses to keep them safe, as well as waterproof vests/lifejackets and goggles for pool/water events. They also wore black and yellow pants along with yellow-colored knee pads. Players' helmets had the team's color emblazoned on them, along with the player's first name on it inside the color. Most often the jerseys were long-sleeved, though for some events, players were given short-sleeved versions. Players were also asked to wear Reebok sneakers which players were given as parting gifts (as described at the end of the show)., The Nickelodeon logo (all caps but with a small caps ""I"") was present as a flying banner above the Guts (again all caps) logo. This logo was emblazoned on a chalkboard's wiped surface, and each letter of GUTS was outlined in white and colored in in yellow. When Global Guts came, a metallic-like spinning world globe illustration was shown behind the logo, and an equator line was struck around the midpoint of the globe., This show as hosted by Mike O'Malley during its entire run, including for the Global Guts season. This was his second TV hosting appearance, as he had previously worked on Get The Picture (another Nickelodeon TV Game Show airing a few years before this show's initial start date.), Moira Quirk was the announcer during the entire run. She always seemed to dress in referee type clothes, but her unique voice led her to become notable in other areas of TV game shows at the time. The host, Mike O'Malley, most often referred to his announcer as just ""Mo"" on set., A.J. McLean (of Backstreet Boy's fame) was a contestant in the first season. In the second season, both Anna Morris and Mike Vogel appeared. In the third season, Ashley Drane and Bobby Boswell (DC United soccer team fame) appeared. During the fourth season, Gregory Haney competed. Few of these special contestants ever won more than just a silver medal., Nickelodeon Guts was aired once a week between September 19, 1992 and January 14, 1996, for a total of 160 episodes. This 160 episodes number includes the number of shows aired during Global Guts' run. Each episode (besides the special episode mentioned momentarily) aired for approximately 30 minutes on a Saturday evening., Nick Guts only had one real special episode; it aired during their normal time slot but doubled in time (which aired on July 25, 1993) as Nickelodeon Guts All-Stars. In the All-Star version, they located three former players (Mike Schmidt, Jana Waring, Kelli Marchewka) who had a perfect score on their show, and brought them back to battle the other two for the ultimate special Guts All-Star trophy. It was a one-hour special and included a total of eight events (including the Rebound, Tornado Run, Hang Ten, Fumble, Mad Max and the Aggro Crag).Parts of Nickelodeon Guts were also used on the Nickelodeon All-Star Challenge gameshow day. They used both the Slam Dunk, Dodge It and Slam-a-Jama games, as well as part of its theme song in that days' game show., Two spin-offs were shown of this show, as is described below.

With all the excitement of Nickelodeon Guts, many different nations around the world (including Germany, Israel, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the United Kingdom) started spinning off the concept of Nickelodeon Guts into their own versions of Nickelodeon Guts. The name of this show was changed to Global Guts instead. Some of the contestants in these other countries would battle it out. Although by the end there were a total of twelve medals given out to each of the eight countries' teams, (slight spoiler) the United Kingdom was the ultimate winner, with a total of eight gold medals, followed by Mexico and the United States with seven and six gold medal wins.These episodes began running as part of the Nick in the Afternoon slot beginning September 5, 1995. In the medals ceremony of Global Guts, the first place finisher team's flag was raised (much like the Olympics), and the winning team's national anthem would be played. Following this, players were able to grab their flag and take a victory lap around the arena where this game was being pre-recorded for the public.
During a 2008 revival of the Nickelodeon Guts series, Nickelodeon aired two seasons of shows called My Family's Got Guts, which brought along this same idea and antics that the old shows had been known to show to their viewers. However, a different host (Ben Lyons) was used along with a different announcer (Asha Kuerten) to complete a game's episode. Also, games didn't run the same way. Teams of two families were formed and points were still given per challenge. Any points obtained over the course of the game could be used to give the family a head start on the Aggro Crag. By the time this revival came out, this was now a bracket challenge-type of game.

During the second season, the introductory segment was expanded and had a memorable opening that most viewers enjoyed watching episode after episode. Some of the screen time was spoken and some was narrated through a girlie apparition-like narrator who flew past a river/stream surrounding the island where the game was supposedly taking place (the narrator called it ""Maze Island"") then dipped into this water body and through the water into the set and finally took the viewer through the complete maze describing the rooms up until the final challenge - explaining the names of the rooms of the maze along the way including the confrontation with her Mirror Man (which you will learn about later) and talked about her Ice Cave and Chamber of Knowledge and even mentioned the final journey up Lightning Mountain (all talked about later in this article).;
, This game was actually a combination of several rounds - played in several parts separated by numerous advertisements following each round and after each elimination time. There was a question round where the players would be asked questions about what they were looking at on a bunch of TV monitors and the winner of that round went into the Maze rounds to battle out for a winner to the game. The winner of those went onto play for that special trip and bonus prizes and even some bonus trophies (though the trip was the most memorable of all for the show). (This will be described momentarily.), The Question round was based on several pieces themselves. A blurred out picture was shown to the three contestant teams on several TV-like monitors and as it become unblurred the players would have a chance to identify the picture. They'd collect points for their team based on correct answers to these pictures. There was a clock set at 15 seconds to answer correctly, and this timer was prominently displayed on the TV program viewer's screen. If their guess was correct, 10 points were awarded and they would then be asked to answer a question relating to that picture that only their knowledge of the subject could solve. If they incorrectly solved the question, the host would ask them to continue to un-blur the picture until the picture wasn't blurry anymore but still within the fifteen seconds allotted for the picture round, however no points were deducted from the player's score. Several of these questions and pictures were asked to the players to identify - and each question was worth 5 points. Once a team had a total of fifty points, they were able to choose if they would like to be the first or second team to enter the Maze (the strategizing decision ensued), as the other two teams were promoted to the next round - the Speed Round.

During the second season however, things changed quite a bit. Instead of a button you pushed that would lead you to identify the picture, you pressed a button on a airplane-like yolk which ""fired a laser-beam""-like line at the screen (which then exploded electronically on the TV set screen) - which then triggered the response of having you buzz in to try and identify the picture. In season two, although the time limit was still set at 15 seconds, it was not shown onscreen to the viewer. Also during season 2, came the occasional Bonus Pictures: These pictures were trickier to answer and hence why these pictures were worth 15 points instead of just ten. However, Bonus pictures only happened once per episode.

, In this round, the remaining players were asked to identify pictures (much like the Question round). However, unlike the Question round, they were not asked the additional questions and correct answers here were awarded 10 additional points tacked onto their first round totals points awarded. However, if the first player buzzed in and guessed but was wrong, the second player wouldn't have additional parts of the picture un-blurred but would be given a clue as to what the picture was referring to. Although many times this clue helped, there were times when this clue made things more confusing to the player., After being sent into a maze of various rooms, one of the players was sent into the maze while his teammate would help guide them through the maze using his/her powersuit that was wirelessly connected to the teammate at the control center that helped guide them using a joystick (airplane-like yolk)-like device. The first room where the player got sent after he/she entered the Maze was called the Mirror Maze; it was set up with hundreds of thousands of identical mirrors lining the walls that led to different areas of the room. However, at one point, the player had to bypass a special mirror who would stop the player in their path and ask them a question (this character was called the Mirror Man, and for season 1 was asked/narrated by the host himself). Generally, the Mirror Man would be positioned several yards before the ""Bridge"" (talked about a little later). To get past him, you'd have to answer a super-cheesy question on pretty much any subject he asked the player. You'd have two chances to answer his question correctly or he'd penalize you an additional five seconds while he moved aside. Following along the path, you'd then have to cross the Bridge. However, on the Bridge you'd have to collect at least 2 of the 3 power sticks that were located there (one was needed to enter the Chamber of Knowledge and the other was to stop the clock). After finding both power sticks, the player was instructed to put down their visor through their earphones in the helmet itself (the visor acted like a blindfold) and the player would be navigated through a Honeycomb maze solely via their partner at the control terminal. Each little cubby had it's own rather-large door that would open, but since each maze pattern was different here was different this could take longer to achieve (and some doors were even locked to prevent entry into/through them) Once the player passed through this room, they'd be instructed to put up their visor to enter a briefing room prior to entering the Chamber of Knowledge - a room where several questions were asked to get the player to the end station. However, in this briefing room, you had to drop the first of your power sticks you found into the slot (everybody in season 1 always found both power sticks). The Chamber of Knowledge's Guardians questions got a little tougher but were more varied by subject of the Guardian in question (these ""Guardians"" asked True/False questions relating to several areas, but were varied by season). If the first question was answered correctly, they'd have to answer at least three other questions to be given the green light to follow through to the next and final area. If they answered incorrectly, they'd have to answer one additional question from another Guardian head. If still no good, they'd have to take a five second penalty. As they exited the Chamber of Knowledge, they dropped their second power stick into the exit-point slot and their Maze run was finished. Your time spent on the Maze round would be tallied and saved.

There were several differences between the way the questions were asked and how the maze was set up for the Maze in season two. During season 2, on top of the elimination of the Honeycomb maze, the Mirror Man had a bigger face and the question was asked directly by the Mirror Man himself (his voice was very gruff). No more in season two were power sticks hidden on the Bridge (you'll see them come up later in the Maze round, however). Before the Ice Cave, you had to answer yet another picture puzzle posed on one small TV monitor (much like the picture puzzles shown in the Question round of the game). Answering correctly and before time was up would allow you to use the shortened path; however, get it wrong or answer it when the time had finished and the Lady of the Maze would send you on a slightly longer path after pushing a metal gate fence the opposite way. There was also the Ice Cave the player had to pass through - the room that the Honeycomb maze was changed into for season two where your visor had to be lowered and you were relying on your partner and host to get you through a room filled with artificial snow and smaller mirror men silhouettes and strobe lights on the floor. And if that wasn't enough, you couldn't bump into any of these obstacles or you'd lose time. In the Ice Room you were asked to find the one and only power stick you needed for the final link at the end (it was located on the wall before the second pair of icicles that tended to come down after many great players tripped over the strobe light). There was no longer a briefing room prior to the Chamber of Knowledge - players would walk down a ramp to get to the Chamber of Knowledge without stopping to check-in with the Lady of the Maze. On top of that, during the Chamber of Knowledge, the first time you answered a question correctly, you would get all the gates that led to the exit portion of the maze opened for you all at once - (However this came at an expense of hearing (towards the player) and seeing (towards the viewer) neat visual effects of the Guardian saying ""Come into my world"" as well as watching an animation of how the question would depicted or what this Guardian would generally was most apt to explain in their question.). Right outside of the gates, you'd find a video monitor where you'd have to shoot your laser on your right wrist at moving targets on the screen - these targets looked like the face of the Mirror Man (the player had to blast two of these faces when the face was at the direct center of the screen utilizing his laser beam with his wrist down to earn the right to proceed). Last but not least, unlike season 1(that you'll learn about later) where you had an additional prize level, towards the end of the maze you had to race up Lighting Mountain to deposit your other power stick which stopped the clock - but used the same path as the Prize round. (the cameraman would switch to watch this scene play out from the Bridge and we'd see this be depicted from behind the tall, red laser light tubes that were on top of the place where the stick would be deposited. .

If you stepped upon the Mirror Man silhouette on the floors of the foggy Cave or pushed around a strobe light in the foggy Ice Cave room, giant icicles came down from the ceiling and you'd be slowed down. You couldn't pass through the second pair of icicles until you grabbed the power stick. However, there was a small area in between two of the icicles in the first set that you could wander around to get you past the first set, but with strobes after the first set of icicles, you're chances of stepping on these were double and most often, these players would knock around these too. Most often, players - despite their team mate helping them - would often get blocked due to this.
A power-stick looked like a laboratory test-tube filled with fluorescent neon green colored light that glowed. However, this wasn't really what was in the tube itself. (TV and broadcasting can give some imperceptions to the viewer.)


Generally, times varied for contestant runs. While it was common for runs to last anywhere in the 2 minute to three minute mark (stopwatch style), there were only a handful of runs that lasted for shorter times than that (season 1 had some memorable times that lasted in the one minute mark - though very uncommon for the show).

, During the first season with the first host in place, the Guardians in the Chamber of Knowledge included the Guardian of History, Guardian of Fantasy, Guardian of the Animal Kingdom, Guardian of the Unexpected (sort of a guardian towards a miscellaneous set of questions), Guardian of Nature and the Guardian of Innovation. During the second season, some of these went missing and the players were asked questions in the Chamber of Knowledge from the Guardian of Education, Guardian of Imagination, Guardian of the Natural World, or the Guardian of Science and Industry. , The other contestant that voted to go second would have his turn. The second contestant would try to beat the time the first contestant tried to set. Whoever was then faster would ultimately win. The same maze layout would ensue for both players., This level of the Maze got interesting, though it used as a follow-up and separate maze for just the first season (the TV screens were removed and this level was later avoided and players had to race up it to place their final power stick in place). Much like when the player was shooting at miniature Mirror Men on a TV screen (if the viewer remembers the pattern from season two), the winning player would race through a smaller maze up Lightning Mountain with the host behind them. On TV screens much like before - the contestant would use their laser beam to shoot at TV screens that blinked either Prize or No Prize. To get a prize, over the course of five monitors, the player would have to shoot and get three consecutive Prize screens. It was all a matter of correct timing and ""firing"" when the TV screen said No Prize but was about to change to Prize to get it to give you the prize., On top of all the rewards they'd get including a shopping spree to the Beverly Hills Sharper Image and a trophy that looked like a power stick, the player wearing the power suit would have to put their visor and head down and their arms at their side while the graphics of the program would take over. And this is where viewers were amazed. The computer to the ""game of the future"" program graphically crumpled the player up onscreen and sent them into a ball that ended up flying around the stage and into the Question and Speed Rounds' TV screen, (for season one). The helper got consolation prizes as well, but these were at less of a cost, but the host verbally recognized them for helping which really helped the ego of this helper-player-teammate.


During the second season, the viewer would see a revised trip sequence after the player was ""crumpled up"" onstage. The Lady of the Maze/girly apparition-like person would lead the player out of the studio and into the galaxy and the player would fly around for a moment or two and this would lead to the credits beginning. Also, for season two, the helper ended up receiving a smaller $75 shopping spree at the same Beverly Hills Sharper Image.

, At first, you could on set the player podiums, and depending on seasons and the time of the game you could see the station that was used when the Team helper was asked to help out guide their player through the Maze's rounds. In back of this and looping around the back, you could the Bridge just in back of the Prize round area where the light ended. You could also the end place which looked like a cave entrance/exit point towards the right of what the viewer saw. With this show and with most of the Family Channel TV game shows that appeared, you could never see the audience but you could hear their clapping and such., During the first year of the show's Question and Speed rounds, players would wear either blue or purple t-shirts (depending on the player's potential to be the runner for the Maze round) with the Masters of the Maze logo in the top left corner (top right corner if looked at from the viewer's perspective). However, during the Question and Speed rounds when the second season came into place, all players wore a power-suit during the entire show. However, following the Question and Speed rounds for both seasons, both racing teammates would wear powersuits with their teammate helpers wearing smaller jet-pack like suits (during season 1) and thinner more-agile power-suits that didn't have as many featured (during season 2).

, On top of the laser beam that would be used when the players right hand would be folded down, the power suit also contained sensors that would be used during the Maze with little vibrating sensors on the player's front, right, back and left sides for the control stick player to indicate what direction they wanted their teammate-player to go. Also, the control stick player could communicate to the racing player through the helmet's earphones and microphone setup. This never changed during either of the seasons but was made more known about in season two prior to entering (when the host asked the teammate helper to push the stick forward, activated their helmet and explained their suit's many useful features).

, The apparition that appeared onscreen and took the players on a journey and the ones who talked to the players shortly before entering the Maze (as well as talked to the player in the briefing room prior to entering the Chamber of Knowledge (during the first season)) was none other than the ""Lady of the Maze"". However, this Lady figure changed between the seasons - being Renae Jacobs during the first season and Clea Montville in the second. Although Renae went on to become a little more popular (helping narrate at other game shows and entertainment venues), Clea had less of a popularity and ended up not starring in any other shows or movies after this narrating job., Each season had only one host, however the first host backed down from the opportunity to host the second season. The show was hosted by J.D. Roth during the first season, and Mario Lopez during the second season of this show. Both hosts went onto other TV game show and TV entertainment venue projects.

, Although the Family Channel (though now called Freeform, and this station has re-branded so as not to include any TV game shows) brought the viewer this show during an early Saturday morning block, it's episodes aired weekly between August 29, 1994 and September 22,1996.. There were about 80 episodes of this show shown to the viewer, based off of the 40 shows during the second season. Sometimes, there'd be a FamTV logo in the bottom right corner of the screen during the first season and a Fam AFTV logo in the bottom right corner during the second season, however, advertisements during the show still presented it as ""The Family Channel"".

Describe the spin-off shows.",How to Become a Fan of the Cash Cab TV Game Show," Each episode began more or less the same way, but with slight tweaks in wording for different series. At first, the camera showed the host standing on the outside of his minivan taxi on a New York City street, facing the Statue of Liberty. He then gave an explanation of the show/game along the lines of: ""There are thirteen thousand cabs in New York City ... but there's only one that pays you. Climb into the Cash Cab, and I'll quiz you all the way to your destination. As the meter clicks, the questions get harder, and the stakes get higher. If you get stumped, you can Shout-Out for help on the phone, or off the street. But be careful, because in the Cash Cab, it's three strikes and you're out! So what do you say? You in?""

Then the camera cut away and the screen showed several static images of the host and the streets of New York City. The logo appeared at the end of the theme song, and then faded. You saw a team of players get into the taxi van (generally anywhere from 2-4 players). The contestants started off unaware that they're in the ""Cash Cab,"" so much like for any other taxi ride, you'd hear one of them telling the driver their destination. The lights above the players head would begin to flash, as the host told them, ""You guys are in the Cash Cab - the TV game show that takes place right here in my taxi. What do you say - Do you want to play?"" When they agreed, you'd see the taxi begin moving around the streets of the city with the host behind the wheel.
Once players got in and told the host where they'd like to go, but before the lights began flashing, they were briefed on the rules of the game. However, this part wasn't shown on television.;
, Generally, players were asked a series of questions throughout their journey. If they got stumped, there were a variety of things they could get help, as discussed later. If the team got the answer right, great! If the team got the answer incorrect, the team would get a strike. Three strikes and the team would have to forfeit - and would have to get out of the cab. All of these questions required only one answer, and they covered all kinds of topics. Rarely were they multiple-choice or true/false questions., When the cab had to stop at a red light, the host would announce a Red Light Challenge question (the host's elongated version of the word ""Challenge"" made this announcement memorable). Generally, Red Light Challenge questions required multiple answers. Teams would have to shout out any answers they could. Wrong answers didn't make the team lose any money nor earn a strike., Each regular Cash Cab question was worth a certain dollar amount; the first four questions were $25, the next four were $50, the following four $100, and after that $200 (though it was rare contestants got to those). Completely and correctly-answered Red Light Challenge questions would generally yield a $250 bonus ($500 in rare instances called Double Rides, such as were used in the Chicago and Las Vegas episodes) to the team's bank. In the special Canadian episodes, there was a special bankable amount where teams could earn double the dollars for answering a question right ""on the bridge""., During the New York City episodes, contestants could call for help in two ways. In a Street Shout Out, the team could elect to ask someone off the sidewalks to answer the question the host asked. In a Mobile Shout Out, one of the team's contestants could call someone who would know the answer (but they only had 15-30 seconds to do so). Nobody had smartphones during the show's airing, so they called from a regular flip cell phone. In the Canadian episodes, there was a ""Swap Out"" Shout Out, too, which would swap out the particular question with another question., If players arrived at their destination without accumulating three strikes, their banked money was safe - so far. But that's when things got tricky. The host would tell the players how much money they won, and give them an option: they could walk away with that money, or they could stick around and risk it all on a double-or-nothing Video Bonus question. Videos were shown on the back of the driver's side and passenger side built-in headrests and could involve difficult questions about anything. Not everyone went for it, but if they did , they'd be shown a clip. The host would narrate a question that referred to the video on the screen. Players had only a few seconds to come up with an answer following the end of the clip. If they answered correctly, great - they doubled their money and walked out of the cab with their winnings. If not, they would have to leave the cab empty handed (except for the free cab ride)., Generally, during a 30 minute episode of Cash Cab, you'd see three ""teams"" participate. With the exception of those in the ""Cash Cab: After Dark"" episode, two of the three rides were provided in daylight hours, and the last ride was shot during the evening or night., The host generally drove a minivan, though the car changed depending on the episode. However, spin-offs in some other countries used more traditional sedan taxis, instead., The logo stayed more or less the same throughout the series, with only minor tweaks. Early on, they displayed the logo on the side of a traditional taxi's back door, while other episodes dropped the taxi and just showed the logo on its own. All the letters to the gameshow were in capital letters, and some versions of the show (notably the ""After Dark"" spin off) had logos that displayed the word ""CASH"" a little brighter than ""CAB"". The top half of the logo was written in a brighter yellow, and most letters were split into two parts right down the middle of each word - some at a slant and others along a diagonal line. The S in Cash was made to look like a dollar sign, and the bottom portion of the yellow dollar sign overlapped the black border that covered the word ""cab"". Cab was written in white, a little smaller than ""cash"". Other variants included changing the color scheme from yellow-on-yellow to white-on-yellow, with a yellow-on-white scheme below (to blend in with the taxi).In the After Dark spin-off, the logo remained the same. After Dark was written in scripted calligraphy to the right of the Cash Cab portion of the logo, over a lit crosswalk.In the Las Vegas episode spin-off, the logo was moved to the very top of the taxi's exterior roof. Inside of the logo, ""Las Vegas"" was written after ""Cab,"" and there were movie-roll film-like stylings around three of the border sides of the black box. You could see the bright lights of the Las Vegas skyline behind. ""Las Vegas"" was written in pinkish purple without splitting the letters in half.Not very many viewers remember the logo for the Chicago show. The ""CASH CAB"" portion was written much like the regular logo, in white text below the cab over near the right. Then the word CHICAGO was written in a simple font. There was no real major differences in this logo.In some versions of the logo, the word Chicago was expanded over the entire width of the Cash Cabs' bottom line, in white.

, The original Cash Cab host was Ben Bailey. Besides Cash Cab, he also held minor roles in several TV movies between 2002 and 2016, including ""30 Rock"" and MADtv.. Beth Melewski hosted the Chicago spin-off of the show, while much later Ben Bailey returned to host the Las Vegas spin-offs of the show., Discovery Channel hosted this show generally in the 8pm ET (7pm CT) primetime hour every weekday (excluding summers). It ran between December 5th, 2005 and January 9th, 2013 for a total of 372 episodes.During the first 24 episodes of season 1, they sometimes aired back-to-back new episodes to fill up that block of the primetime hour., Cash Cab spawned a wealth of spin-off TV gameshows, including Cash Cab: After Dark, Cash Cab: Chicago, and Cash Cab: Las Vegas. Cash Cab: After Dark was very similar to regular Cash Cab but only involved the nighttime hours in the ""City that Never Sleeps"". It was hosted by Ben Bailey in 2007 for a total of 9 episodes. Cash Cab: Chicago aired in 2011 for 36 episodes.Cash Cab: Las Vegas aired in 2011.Many countries aired their own version of Cash Cab including Canada (British Columbia), where a regular car with the stylized working were used."

Get used to the main game music from the introductory credits as well as the theme music from when each obstacle course's prize was introduced after the host would introduce the obstacle).",How to Become a Fan of Nickelodeon's Double Dare TV Game Show," Before the opening credits flashed, the host would generally say ""On your mark...get set....Go!!!!"" then a game would be played. Though the directions of this game were never formally introduced to home-viewers, by watching this game, you'd see how each of these games were played.Generally, players had to fill a beaker of water that contained a large yellow line, or toss a number of props across a line to another player on stage with a number of different games. Sometimes it would be a water relay where players would have to fill a beaker with water from a variety of items, to sometimes players having to throw and catch props that could be any number of possible items into bigger-sized mock stage-props where their teammate would be situated. Once that toss-up challenge on stage was completed, a dinging sound would be heard and the game would end. The introductory credits would then display with a loud ""splash"" sound as the title pane appeared. Contestants would walk up to their contestant podium to dry off and complete the rest of the game.;
, This will be described below., Once dried off, the host would introduce both teams (team structure and team colors will be talked about later). He'd go over the rules. Generally, it sounded like these rules were well rehearsed and the rules never changed from episode to episode and never dropped or changed even the simple rules. The team who won the introductory round won control of the first question. The host would generally use these lines: ""I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you'll have to either answer that question or take the physical challenge."" )., They could answer it or pass it to the other team (or by playing strategy if they knew it but wanted more money and thought the other team might not know) - saying ""Dare"". The question would then fall on the other team onstage, who could answer it or pass it right back - all by saying ""Double Dare"". However, when it got passed back to the initial team who originally passed it (with the ""Dare"" response), the team could answer the question or take what's called the Physical Challenge - a short game (most games lasted no longer than 45 to 60 seconds) that utilized the team's physical traits or muscle. After several of these question-answer-challenges were asked, points were doubled and more questions were asked. After a brief set of advertisements, the show came back, and there was another toss-up round without the ""on your mark"" mentioning. Dollar or point values were doubled following this and were answered in the same style as before the advertisement. The team with the highest point (and later money) values on the board generally won the game and was able to go for the grand prize in what was called the 8-itemObstacle Course.

Players would win points (and later money) for answering the questions(or for completing a physical or toss-up challenge or to the full extent). Generally, it was $10 ($20 for toss up or during Family Double Dare ($50)/Double Dare 2000 ($25 with normal questions winning $25 points upon not having a dare placed, and having won a physical challenge ($40 later escalating to $100 during Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000) there'd be money involved and control of the next question., Although Physical Challenge challenges varied, physical challenge times varied not only by the type of challenge that occurred, but by the year the episode was taped (and most often by the exact show that was shown in the series). Most often times, this challenge lasted 45 seconds but could have been changed to become longer or shorter as the challenge varied.

Sometimes during the series run of both Super-Sloppy and Family Double Dare run, the host would mention that each physical challenge is tried with sample families and always tested to be easy enough to complete. But time and time again, some challenges are easier done off-stage than on and some challenges just didn't make the cut for some players to successfully complete.

, If the teams passed these obstacles, they'd end up winning a grand prize. If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle that was successfully played, they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted never resulted in a prize won and they wouldn't be able to complete the remainder of the challenges. Players on the teams reaching this stage of the game had to win the obstacles, by finding a marked hidden red flag on the top of a pole that was as high as the obstacle allowed them to reach or in a mess of Nickelodeon rather edible liquid concoctions (such as the event The Sandwich or the pizza or the famous ""In Da Nose"" (where players had to reach up into a giant nose to find a flag inside the giant nostrils). Whether it was rolling down a slide filled with gooey substances (that were actually edible) to find a flag as you went down it, a ball pit-like pool (or sometimes was filled with water and mock alligator balloons) where the contestant had to make his way across to find the flag at the top of the pole or reaching down into a huge pool of colorful whipped cream that represented ice cream or one of a variety of things, as long as you were able to hand off the red triangular flag with the number of the obstacle on it to your partner who would rush from the end of your obstacle to theirs and completed theirs and switched off, completed that obstacle and handed that one off, your team would win the grand prize along with all the prizes successfully accomplished along the way.

The obstacle course was a timed challenge. Generally, the obstacle course would last for no more than 60 seconds, though sometimes to a kid, this felt a whole lot longer...

, Although this varied by show, by the time this show became called Family Double Dare and later Double Dare 2000 (both of these you will learn about later in this article), the grand prize generally was trips to various family-fun places including sometimes Universal Studios Florida (later called Universal Orlando) (However, with this being taped at Universal Studios Florida at the time, this kind of broke the fun for the family for another separate family vacation here, when they've been in this park already.) If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle they got through they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted they wouldn't win the prize for., During this show, Nickelodeon supplied players with a free T-shirt with the Double Dare, Super Sloppy Double Dare, Family Double Dare or Double Dare 2000 logo (depending on which exact year this show was being filmed). Players were given either a blue shirt or red shirt along with an interesting (and sometimes even rhythmically rhyming) name. While the blue team would stand to the host's right, the red team would stand to the host's left. Players would also be given a free pair of sneakers - most often times these were Reeboks, while at sometimes later this changed to become Nike's when the promotional product placement contract changed hands.

During the first season of the show, all players wore red shirts, but due to a new TV game show on Nickelodeon (called Finders Keepers) in the second year, Double Dare changed their shirts so that each team wore different-colored shirts to designate the two different teams for the host to respond to so confusion didn't constantly happen.

, While watching, you'll see that during both Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, teams were composed of two kid players. When this series became Family Double Dare and was revived in 2000 (for Double Dare 2000), these teams held four players each (Family Double Dare generally contained a mother, a father and two kids who all interacted intelligently for each team.), Look for what the contestant desks looked like, along with the score-board for the team and what the stage looked like where the Physical Challenges were played.

Although the contestant desks stood on a podium that was long enough for both players from the team to stand behind, there would be a towel rack on the left side of the desk (when watching, you'd see the towels on camera on this towel rack).
Above the player podium, would be the players scoreboard. This scoreboard would not in any way be attached to the desks. Depending on the team colors, they would designate in digital form the numbers to the amount of money or points the team would accumulate. Each of these scoreboards would have rounded corners (on the earlier episodes these were tall triangular boards that contained a line of digital numbers for the score along with the program icon below it) and each portion of the backdrop of each number would be set on a black background.
In between the two teams would be the host's desk that looked a bit like the contestant's desk but was meant to fit just the host. It had the picturesque icon of the Double Dare name (interconnected D's (DD)) on a plaque (placard) at the center-most portion of the host-desk. Above (in back of) the host of the show, there would be a revolving time clock. From the ""waiting position"" containing the interconnected DD insignia, the time clock would revolve counterclockwise around when a physical challenge was needed revolved back clockwise at the end of the stunt.
The floor in front of the team's desks would be where the Physical challenges would be held. The floor always seemed to be spotless before a Physical Challenge was held. Depending on the wetness of the challenge, it was the stage crew's responsibility for cleaning it up while not showing themselves on camera (more on that in a minute, as there is at least one popular name that will come to mind in the fan of this show). The floor was this blue checkerboard with crisscrossing lines of greyish yellow, that was fairly large (about a quarter of the width of a given football field)
In between the Physical challenge area and Obstacle Course, the fan would sometimes see two steps where contestants could walk down (when the camera wasn't turned on them) to get to the Obstacle course. However, these steps would never be used in any challenge, but were visible in some camera shots during the Obstacle course run. (These steps were less visible during the Double Dare 2000 taping, but were still present)
In front of the Physical Challenge area would be a large area wider than the Physical Challenge area that held the Obstacle Course. It contained eight obstacles on the floor. In back of this and to each of the sides you'd generally see the viewer seating to watch as the episodes were taped. Also, you'd see in between the Obstacle Course and the home-viewer seating all the cameras and equipment that would make for a fantastic production number.
Viewers who chose to take a studio tour during this time and/or go in for a taping would notice what was happening in the hallway nearby. The hallway in back of the show area contained several other obstacles that weren't being used in that day's taping, but could be used on other episodes.

, Although Marc Summers was the starred host of this show for most of the series' run (from the creation of this show in 1986 till 1993), this show was shot with him as being the host from Double Dare to Super Sloppy Double Dare till Family Double Dare and concluding in 1993. However, when Double Dare was revived in 2000, another host came up onstage instead; This host's name was the little-known Jason Harris who did little along the lines of other gameshows that were set for TV. While Marc Summers had a few other TV shows he was responsible for, following his taping on Double Dare (""What Would You Do?""), it was Double Dare that really brought Marc the fame and glory for the great name on his resume. (Marc Summers later hosted the documentary of how certain packaged food products are prepared on the Food Network show ""Unwrapped"".Double Dare 2000 had some of the same rules but it had several additional challenges and some changes to the Obstacle Course.

, Although the name of this article says some of it, Nickelodeon brought the viewer these games, during a programming block between 4 and 5 pm (Eastern Time). It shot and aired over 592 episodes (525 of which aired as either Double Dare (10/6/1986 - 2/19/1988), Super Sloppy Double Dare (10/6/1986 - 2/19/1988, daily) or Family Double Dare (8/13/1990 - 2/6/1993)). These aired between 1986 and 1993 as was stated before. Each of these episodes generally ran anywhere between 21 and 24 minutes (though some aired no longer than 26 minutes long, but tallying with advertisements, all episodes fit neatly into the 30 minute time block that was allotted per show. Although there were some shows (Super Sloppy Double Dare) that ran daily, each show ran only on Saturday nights on Nickelodeon. for Double Dare, Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000. (Double Dare 2000 aired between 1/22/2000 and 11/10/2000.), During a production or in the final presentation of the episode to the TV viewer, when the host mentioned the names Robin (it was rather common to hear this name on-screen), recognize that Robin Marella and Dave Shikiar (1986-1990) or even Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Mileswere all just stagehands that helped in preparation of the show and during cleanup of the production stage between the toss-up question and physical challenges, all without being seen on camera (down on their knees with off-white colored towels). Robin sometimes brought out the stage props for Physical Challenges., Although all fans of Double Dare recognize the narrators, fans should recognize three names. There was one who went by just his first name upon the program (he was called Harvey) taping, there would sometimes be heard other names of other narrators that would help out on other shows. When Family Double Dare came to air, the name ""Doc Holliday"" showed up as the narrator instead on some episodes of 1992 and all episodes of the 1993 airings. When Double Dare was revived for Double Dare 2000, Tiffany Phillips replaced them all and became the new narrator/announcer.

Harvey would sometimes be seen on camera when Super Sloppy Double Dare was being taped and aired. But this wasn't normal to see his face present.

, Although the concepts remained the same when the show was brought over from Nickelodeon to the FOX Family Channel in the 1990s, the hosts differed along with the sets and overall end game and even point values/money changed in how things were set up.

CBS also had a game show that they called Double Dare that was hosted by a very young Alex Trebek. But it had a completely different set of rules and end result for the game along with almost everything else during the game and should never be compared to the Nickelodeon game show. (These episodes air in syndication on BUZZR, and these don't generally make it much to YouTube.).

, This game theme music was called ""On Your Mark"" and any fan of this show will remember it from memory, though Double Dare 2000 had a revised edition of this song used during it's run.

Also, recognize the short musical segue between the time the end of the host introducing the obstacle in the Obstacle Course and when the prize was shown.

The show music would then begin - most viewers and fans remember this music - even to this day. The narrator would come back a few seconds after the show's icon would randomly change colors and flash these differences every few milliseconds (then quickly fly off the screen and disappear) and with a quick rhetoric referring to the introduction of the host (something along the lines of ""And here's with your space-age host and didn't ever tell a joke that you didn't like..."") and introduced the host's name. The host would walk across the screen until he arrived behind his own podium on-set and stood before the contestants. The host would most-often thank the narrator and welcome all the contestants to the game, then explain the episode's game board and rules and the game would begin.



 ;
, This game had a few rounds that you had to get through, that will be described below., Players competed on answering questions, based on the game board that is described in a subsequent step. Players had to complete a game board so that each player had to solve one question in each grade level as well as one question in each category, and while that seemed too simple to accomplish, with the possibility of three teams vying for the same space, this seemed quite complicated. The first team to do so won the game and the right to advance to the Honors round, as well as a monetary gain of $500 and the same pair of British Knights sneakers (the losers would also be given). It was tracked on the players game board in front of them and (as you'll see later), lights lit up on the board as the questions were answered. If no player finished their game board, the player with the most question lights on their game boards won the game and was chosen to advance to the Honors round.

Losers of the Question round got $50 for their appearance on the show as well as a free pair of British Knights sneakers to take home with them.

, This round was a final Grand Prize round that resulted in more cash and in the second and third season(described below) a trip right back to Universal Studios (now called Universal Studios Orlando). At first, players had to choose a category out of three possible choices: In one specific situation, you could have been presented with Dogs, Cats or Mice (just as an example) and each question that you answered from the set of 7 questions from seven categories relating to that top-level category still led you to money. Generally, these seven questions generally related back to the same seven categories the player would have seen from the day's Question round. Each correct answer was worth $100, though once you answered question 7 right, you won the Grand Prize of a total of $1000 or the trip (dependent on season). Players could pass on a question and more often rarely got back to trying again - otherwise if answered incorrectly, they were told they were wrong but were unable to answer again and could never win the bonus question. The player was given 45 seconds to answer all seven questions., During the second and third season, this game was more often a space filler than any real part of the process in the game. Players were given several more questions which didn't really have any real category to them. More often the contestant was rather easily able to answer them. The contestant was given a question at a low dollar amount at first. If they answered the question correctly, they were given this money at the end, and they could choose to go onwards to the next question. If the next question was answered correctly, they could go onwards yet again and so on. There were questions for winnings of $50, $100, $200, $500 and $1000; players had to begin at the beginning and work their way up to the $1000. . However, miss a question or ask to pass and you end up loosing the University Round and only walk out with the money from the Question and Honors rounds with no money from the University round., Other season space fillers included (first season) the host (as you'll see later) Lew Schneider traveling to malls and asking random mall walkers questions for minimal money while on the third season the host would walk out into the audience and begin asking random people questions for T-shirts and other random small prizes. If the game was won way too early and the University Round couldn't cover it without even more time, a second game had to begin but was played in abbreviated time. However, playing an abbreviated game as a tie-in at the end was super-rare., The beginning question was answered and in a two sentence summary, a summary was given to answer it. The credits then rolled and the game concluded with the credits and such rolling onscreen., Contestants drew from a mechanical split-flap game board that had a total of 49 squares on it. It was 7 squares vertical by 7 squares horizontal. Each of these boards had seven categories to choose from (from the vertical direction) and several ""grade levels"" (going horizontally). It was operated mechanically and everytime a player asked to see what was behind this door (whether it be a question the players had to answer, a challenge (that you'll learn about in an upcoming step) that this show called a ""Fire Drill"", take a square or loose a square space), the home viewer could hear the clicking of the doors as they were opened and closed. You couldn't see the wires, but you could tell that this wasn't something that was technological in design (as many other Nickelodeon TV game shows could tout.)

Players could pick from several categories. Most often this consisted of art or science or social studies or math or however, along with one ""special elective"" that rarely ever fit into other categories on the board. Along the top, they had several grade levels consisting of Elementary as well as grade levels between 7th and 12th grade.

Sometimes players even picked squares that had already been revealed and had to be either told that it was already chosen by another team or if it led to a loose a square space that was already revealed, tended not to change and the action was taken yet again - thereby making players even that much more depressed at their actions.


As a player, you could run into several types of squares and square designations. They had squares for each team's colors, along with squares marked with a question mark (for when the host had to ask the teams to answer a question), Take (for when the team could take a square of another team's color as their own) or Loose (when a team would lose their color-denoted square) as well as black squares which were designations of squares that were answered by all teams but were answered incorrectly. There was a Free square which could help a team take another square without being penalized or having to answer a question, but these were rather rare (especially in the second and third season). had denoted squares that had been lost from the Loose-a-Square space elsewhere on the board.

, Fire drills were similar to Physical Challenges (but without the messiness) on Nickelodeon's Double Dare. Almost most were physical, they involved all three players partaking in challenges. Although it seemed like games never crossed between one episode and another, one fan could notice that the directions of using a fake hammer to toss a stuffed rat"" onto a toy that looked like an enlarged mousetrap until the trap snapped onto the mouse. Generally, the winners of these contests got their choice of what color spot they'd like to return to and most often the winner chose to move to the team with the highest other square. These changes were cheesy and could sometimes mean a big win for a team even if the move only lasted a few minutes., The set was comprised of several items. Although it seemed like the shots were taken in a cubed room that was tilted at an angle, there were several items in this room.

The game board was at the top-most corner, but was tilted at an angle so that the players could easily read it. Closer to the audience but away from the players (if an imaginary line was drawn) was the host and host's podium (a cylindrical stand that was yellow in color with colored paint blotches).
Across from the game board in the top right corner and off to the players' right were the location of the Fire Drills. The viewer and fan could tell that this was the corner when you saw almost equal podiums in this corner when the camera was changed so the players were shown getting up from their desks and walking to the Fire Drill location.
Across the alleyway from the host's desk, you could see the contestant desk areas. One main thing that stood out was the light board for each team and below it and expanded over all three desks was a yellow banner with the show insignia on it. You could tell the light board was there and how it was set up when you saw a square-like light board with one row of lights for the categories and one row of all the grade levels (as was described previously). Each desk looked like an enlarged student desk from a school with that special game board in front of it where you'd generally see the student's knees, legs and feet.
Behind that, sometimes you could see the player's selection buttons and desk, but these times were varied, but sometimes you could tell when the players were moving to get to the FIre Drill location in the studio set.
Behind this even still, you'd find the player sitting on their stools which at times looked like even more like the podiums used for the host desk and Fire Drill holding place, while at other times in other seasons looked like the chairs like a student desk without the cross bar attaching it to the desk portion - these were freely movable but didn't seem to have rollers. They were steady, but you could tell there was some space in between them but were firm and were unmovable.

, On Make the Grade, there were three teams. They each wore one color, that was either red, green or blue. In later episodes, green was changed to yellow., Players generally were seen wearing yellow t-shirts (no matter what team color they were on) with the show logo (described later in this article) across the player's chest on the shirt. In the first season, the show logo was more centered across the entire shirt and the contestants baby-blue/light-blue like colored index card-like nametag in the player's shirtpocket-like corner. In the second season, the show logo became more pronounced in the corner and the yellow-colored (that sometimes even matched the color of the shirt) nametag would be worn on the opposite side of the shirt.

The host however, never wore any certain same shirt. He'd wear something more casual and most often could be seen wearing a sweater or sweatshirt on the set.
TV viewers could rarely see what the contestants wore as far as their pants or shoes, so this article can't vouch for these details. However, most often contestants on a Nickelodeon game show were given sneakers (brand logo information omitted) upon the rights to use brand marketing as advertisements at the end of the show.

, The show's icon was rather whimsical. Although the elliptical format of the logo with the weird writing that had some letters in all caps, the logo extended in all the corners into what made the logo appear to be some spaceship-like logo., During the first season, Lew Schneider hosted the show. This was Lew's first real acting job as the host of a show. However, Lew went on to host, produce and direct other shows including some of the 1999 season of Everybody Loves Raymond (among others) and is currently the producer of the hit TV show The Goldbergs.On the other hand, during the second season, they replaced Lew and brought in Robb Edward Morris who, much like Lew, had his initial appearance on Make the Grade which brought him fame, but who hasn't had a decent time with other roles, having last acted in 2016 on the show ""Aquarius"" but having two upcoming roles in two TV shows in 2017., During the entire run of the show, this show had an announcer named Maria Milito. This was Maria's one and only acting-announcing job and has no other upcoming gigs., This show aired between October 2, 1989 and December 29, 1991 on Nickelodeon for a total of 160 episodes over the course of three seasons (Fall-Winter 1989, Spring 1990 and Fall-Winter 1990).These episodes were re-released in syndication as reruns on the Nick Gas channel (between January 2,2000 and April 2,2004) until that too was dropped (when the station went belly-up and couldn't make a comeback). Each episode lasted about 23 or 24 minutes, but along with advertisements, this show was shown during a half-hour block of time once or twice a week over the course of a weekend schedule."

Be able to recall what the set looked like when you pieced everything together.",How to Become a Fan of the Legends of the Hidden Temple TV Game Show," After a sequence where the cameras would zoom and move about in an area where there were Mayan rainforest, the camera would wander into that of Olmec, an Olmec talking head, who'd start out saying the name of the show (""Legends of the Hidden Temple""). Olmec would then continue after you'd see a technological icon of a Pendant of Life crash into each other saying ""With your guide"" and introduce the host of the show (which as you'll learn a little later was Kirk Fogg). He'd continue ""And here he is now"" as you'd generally start seeing him swinging on a rope-vine coming into the stage just in front of Olmec at such an angle where when he turned 180degrees he'd be looking at Olmec. At other times, he'd come down the stairs next to Olmec and talk to the crowd to announce his presence. He'd welcome it's viewers ""Welcome to the Hidden Temple. THe rooms are filled with lost treasures (talked about a little later) but the rooms are protected by mysterious Mayan Temple Guards."" He'd generally always say that ""Olmec knows the mystery behind each of the treasures hidden in his temple"", which would get the viewer to the words ""Which story are we going to hear today?"" Olmec would respond with the title of the show's treasure for the day. The guide host would then introduce the teams just by team color as the camera moved from the team closest to him towards the farthest team away from him."" He'd have a shot at explaining that the teams would have to pass certain tests both physical and mental and that only one team can make it to the temple. They'd explain how the Moat had to be crossed in the daily challenge, and you'd hear Olmec try to get things started. Olmec would burst out with ""Oh yeah!"" or ""let's rock"" or something to that effect.;
, On this show, there were four separate components. Starting with six teams (each team contained one boy and one girl), each round eliminated a few teams. The show started with six teams (team names/types announced in an upcoming step soon), but after the moat crossing (of Round 1), teams were eliminated. After the mental challenge (questions round) in the ""Steps of Knowledge"" it narrowed the field to two teams. These two teams went head-to-head in the Temple Games with other games testing the physical abilities of the teammates. This led to only one team entering the temple and competing for the grand prize. (This will be described below.), The Moat always had to be crossed. Whether it was one team walking on the bottom floor of the Moat while the other walked a rope across or fording the Moat with a unsinkable foam and some oars or some other form of crossing, this had to be completed. Once both team members were out of the Moat, one of the two members (second member to cross) had to strike the golden pedestal gong denoting their team color had crossed. The first four of the six teams to reach and slam their gongs that displayed their colored light for their team color would be able to advance to the Steps of Knowledge in the next round. This event had no time limit in most games.








If you are thinking that crossing a pool of water is unsafe, well, would you walk or cross in an unsafe pool? - think again! There were spotters near the moat that were always available to ensure the team's safety. (However, they more or less verified that all procedures were carried out accurately for each challenge).



, The Steps of Knowledge began with Olmec, a Olmec talking head, giving the four teams the information about the legend they heard in the introduction. This information was used (along with some knowledge from History classes at school) to answer questions that Olmec asked about the legend). After describing the treasure's history, the guide/host would then ask Olmec for information into where the treasure was located in that day's challenge/game. This took place on a set of steps onstage. Most of these questions were multiple choice so it wasn't very hard for the team not to guess something completely incorrect the first time through, but some teams made it look a lot easier and answered incorrectly before the choices were read to them (because some teams were impatient to wait). Once players thought they knew the answers to the questions, the team-mate could stepping on a button or ancient Mayan-like marking on the floor. If the team got the question right and Olmec said they had answered the question correctly, they were able to advance one step further. If they answered the question incorrectly, they could not advance but would not have to take a step back (they were just not allowed to answer the question again until the next question began. After four main ""Steps"" on the Steps of Knowledge, the first two teams to reach the bottom step would go on to the next round in the temple games. This stage was never a timed stage/round.

, The Temple Games were challenges that tested each team in three games of strength, smarts and stamina(as the guide host says ""the glory goes to the fastest and strongest"") . Whether it was turning around or crawling up a rock wall to grab pieces of foam that looked like wood or attempting to grab an item from a pedestal from an incline that the contestant had to climb while holding on to hand grips or something else physically challenging but not impossible to complete, each of the two remaining teams had to compete and race head to head in these games. After each game, Pendants of Life were awarded. If only one team completed the challenge to the fullest extent within the 60 second period (the first two games were a half Pendant and the third was a full pendant but in this game generally both players from the team competed together, a full pendant of life was awarded). If the teams tied, each team would get a half pendant. If neither team was able to achieve the task (rare occurrence), no pendants were awarded.There were generally three Temple Games the teams needed to compete in simultaneously. One partner attempted the one, then the second player of the team would attempt to compete in the other). However, on the third game both players of both teams had to compete. All of these games lasted 60 seconds on a time clock. (But don't confuse this with the ultimate Temple Run-named round that happened as a result of this.)






If both teams had the same amount of Pendants of Life at the end, a Tie-Breaker question would be asked by Kirk (the host, in the season 1 episodes) or Olmec (in Season 2 and 3). These questions would be based on the legend in the style of the Steps of Knowledge questions. But the result of this changed between the first and following seasons.






In the first season, if the team that buzzed in gave an incorrect answer, the other team automatically went onto the Temple Run. But for the following seasons, the other team was given the chance to answer.These Pendants of Life were later used for the winning team in the upcoming Temple Run round that was a resultant round at the end of the show.


For winning the Temple Games, the winners would receive a prize which would change dependent on show and season.

, The Temple Run was the final challenge on all shows. The winning team of the Temple Games raced through thirteen different rooms trying to retrieve the day's legends item. Olmec would describe each room, ask which player was going first (the player would generally say ""I am"") and Olmec would respond with that player's real name. Olmec described what would happen if they met up with a Temple Guard and mentioned what would happen if that player didn't have a Pendant for the guard. Olmec would then use the other players name of the team and walk him through. Olmec would never let the teams know of his intended path to get to the room containing the treasure, though the path always was a bit convoluted to get to the treasure When the host signaled that it was okay to enter, the clock would start at three minutes.Utilizing a labyrinth of rooms the player had to climb or run a series of steps to open doors that would lead them through the course all while setting pieces together to unlock doors, the last remaining teammate would head into this temple area-of rooms. They unlocked each door using the method provided (and described before the run by Olmec). The objective of the game was to retrieve and bring out the hand-made stage prop that might have looked like the real treasure from the legend earlier in the show. If the team retrieved the item, all the doors would open and the team could exit back out to their team mate to win the grand prize. If they retrieved it within the three minute time period, they would win the grand prize which was generally a trip to some exotic place most kids deem as great places to visit (as such on a vacation).






If the team that entered the Temple with only a pendant and a half of life, the remainder of the second pendant was hung in one of the rooms awaiting the second player. However, they still had to risk being caught by the third temple guard - only a half pendant would send them home with their prizes from whatever they won from before the Temple run had begun.If the teams only had one pendant, the other one was not hanging and the second player of the team had to run in with pure luck of not saying ""Hi"" to a temple guard.Although the rooms (described later) changed and varied from show to show and season to season, an average of 40 different rooms during each season were constructed in two layers into a set of bottom level rooms and top level rooms. Generally, for each show about 13-15 rooms were chosen to become the temple layout (split over the two levels) for that particular show. Only a select few rooms never changed their location nor their name nor there entry and exit strategies for the contestants to enter through/exit from season one till series ending.
Once the treasure was retrieved, all the doors (which were sometimes walk-through and sometimes crawl-through at both high and low and activated (after completing the room's task) by a simple button on the wall. in the temple would open, Temple Guards didn't come back out and the players would just race trying to get back out the door towards their partner awaiting them on stage all before the three minute clock ran out.The team color (as described later) that was able to achieve taking the piece out of the Temple in the time provided was the Green Monkeys..

, Those rooms on the bottom level contained The Cave of Sighs/Ledges, Pit of Despair, Wheel Room, Rock Quarry, Pit and the Pendulum, Throne Room, Room of Harmonic Convergency, Laser Light Room, Tomb of the Headless Kings, Swamp, Spider's Lair, Holes of Python, Jester's Court, Bamboo Forest, Tomb of Ancient Kings, Dark Forest, The Dungeon, Well Room, Mine Shaft and Quicksand Bog.. The rooms of the top layer included Pirates Cove, Room of Three Torches, Lightning Ball Room, Vipers Nest, Room of the Secret Password, Shrine of the Silver Monkey, Treasure Room (rarely ever contained the day's treasure in fact), Room of the Golden Orb, Room of the Golden Idol, Kings Storeroom, Room of the Ancient Warrior, Heart Room, Room of the Mandarin Hand, Chamber of the Sacred Markers, The Observatory, Room of the Three Gargoyles, Room of the Royal Gongs, and the Crypt. There were approximately 16 Temple Run layouts constructed for use over this series' run.Although the temple setups differed from year to year and episode to episode, there was only one room that never changed it's place in the temple from either episode to episode nor year-to-year and that was the Shrine of the Silver Monkey., Occasionally, players encountered a Temple Guard. Temple Guards (sometimes scared the contestant) with their Mayan headdress on (as the contestant entered didn't expect to find them) but these Guards could be pacified if you had a full Pendant of Life and could continue after handing them the Pendant. However, if you didn't have it, the first player would be taken out and second player would enter starting from the beginning of where you left off; however, if you were the second player and you didn't have a pendant you lost the game for your team and would be taken out through a back entrance back to the stage via the Temple Guard.





, Teams would generally win a trip back to Universal Studios Orlando if they got the item out of the Temple in the time period, along with smaller prizes which varied by episode and by season.

Kirk Fogg, the host of Legends of the Hidden Temple, was interviewed once when he told the world that due to financial constraints there could only be eight shows per season that could end with grand prize winners. If too many were achieved too early, the backstage people would wish the show could be over, the time would tick out and the winner wouldn't be able to make it in time. , Each team that was onstage wore different shirts. Each shirt had a iron-on transfers of their team type. Originally, there are six teams comprised of the Red Jaguars, Blue Barracudas, Green Monkeys, Orange Iguanas, Purple Parrots, and Silver Snakes. Although most often these shirts had to be turned in at the end of the show (as in the case of the Silver Snakes who were supposed to be Yellow but because of the Yellow helmets couldn't and this was a legal matter), there are still some companies devoted to making duplicates out there that can be repurchased if the person is a fan at a price., Although this show is now off the air there are still some users out there that have the complete series of this show on YouTube - (search and you will find these user's channels - type ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" and look for all playlists for this show) . This show aired it's first episode on September 11,1993(with the Legend of Blackbeard's Treasure Map) and ended it's primary run on December 29, 1995(what a horrible and shocking holiday present fans must have had a few days before New Years Eve happened when they found out this show was the series finale ever) with the Legend of the Jewel-Encrusted Egg of Catherine the Great. The show produced 120 episodes within the three years it aired. It aired on weekends to fill the 6:30pm time slot, but about halfway through it's primary run (in February 1994) they added a few weekday airings at 5:30pm. No new episodes were taped following their April 1996 production schedule.


It ran in syndication for a few years following this on Nickelodeon. However, in 1998 the syndications stopped on Nick when Nickelodeon's sister station (Nick Gas took these episodes and re-aired them until Nick Gas disintegrated in 2007. Since Nick Gas has finalized their schedule, it has occasionally happened that TeenNick has aired a few programs, though this schedule wasn't as available as all other previous airings, so few are known to be existent in this world to this day and your best bet is through YouTube for full episodes. There were no special holiday edition/airings, though on occasion, this show was aired near the holiday itself.

, Kirk Fogg was the one and only host of this show. This show was Kirk's first and only TV game show as him as the host though he's had other jobs on several other movies.. Commonly, fans know the opening line ""Legends of the Hidden Temple. With your guide. Kirk Fogg. And here he is now""as one of those lines that all fans know and love (just the way Olmec says it at the beginning is enough to get fans to gather around the TV and pleasurably watch it.





, Although Olmec the Olmec talking head's head is onstage with his mouth moving, he was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker who has had other jobs besides this, though Olmec on Legends of the Hidden Temple was his first narrating job., During the Big Help on October 3,1994, a special edition of this show aired. Although the airing of the show was special because Olmec and his narrator Dee Baker joined the cast, several of the past winning contestants joined in a battle that didn't comprise of anything like the original airing, there was one part in the second episode on the day that utilized a portion of the Temple Games where players had to walk around a wheel that was turning rather rapidly. It was hosted by Nick Guts' Mike O'Malley, Robin Marella (recognize her from Double Dare and Robin from What Would You Do?), and Phil Moore from Nickelodeon's Nick Arcade along with various other Nickelodeon game show hosts of the time. It also featured games similar to Nick Guts and Wild and Crazy Kids along with a question and answer round (similar to Double Dare) where wrong answers or non answers these contestants would get slimed(though these slimings were unique and not similar to any other show at the time)., You could spot the temple and Olmec and the steps (left to right) followed by a gleam of the moat but not much else. During the introductory scene when Kirk, the host introduced the characters and spoke to Olmec, you could understand the setup. However, the Temple Games were never set up during the Moat round but would be seen much later. Temple Games would be played in to the left of Olmec (when seen from the viewers perspective)."

In addition to that, you sometimes see references others might not get, and in some ways you might even be able to predict some things happening. And you can quote, associate and sound smart about it at the same time.

, Listen to the soundtrack.

, Feel comfortable throwing in random references, inside jokes, quotes and memorable moments into your conversations. It shouldn't be too much, but funny quips, statements and how certain scenes affected you should work.

, You can create a Google Alerts or search every day. It might seem like you're stalking the actors, but who cares? Another way is Instagram, follow some popular as well as the official accounts, and you probably won't miss news.

, Seek out some Sherlock fans to converse with. Just a warning, tumblr is incredibly crazy. But also incredibly funny.


Talk with the fans. Make friends with the people who share the same passion. They'll know what you're talking about.

, You could also get posters, print out fanart you like, or even draw something yourself.

, The really hard fans cry most of the time there's news, maybe you don't want to get into it that deep.

, The only downside about Sherlock. The dreaded wait. Meanwhile, it's a good reason to rewatch a healthy amount of the previous seasons. Heck, you could even get the mug with ""Without Sherlock there's not happiness"" printed on it. It's a good mantra.

, Try to dress in the Sherlock style.


Try to find the signature coat, the scarf, maybe some accessories in the apartment.
Even a shirt with 'I am Sherlocked' on it is a proud testament of your fandom.







, If others say you're obsessed, good. It's a compliment. Ignore their insults or counter them. Nerd life is better.


Even get the Moriarty/Sherlock Theme ringtone if you have to, or Irene Adler's text alert noise. Stayin' alive is a good thing to start with, people who haven't seen the show won'T get it's a reference, but fans will.

Decide in what capacity are you gonna be a fanatic of the Stargate franchise, or in military parlance, becoming either an active or reserve Gater, as what Brad Wright in 2001 would refer to fans of the then Stargate SG-1 television series and the movie that started it all.,
If you watched the movie and the subsequent series before, or have not watched them, then do it, even if you are an avid Gater!,
Read the books, for being a true fanatic of the Stargate franchise is having read some of them.,
Registering at Gateworld's forum can also bring you closer to the franchise, so join the conversation there.,
Use quotes and lines from the franchise in conversations.,
Play SG-related games.,
Learn the races, the ships, the technologies, both human and alien, and Stargate Command itself.,
You can even collect SG-related items and memorabilia and display them in your home.,
Attend Stargate Conventions or cons with the SG cast present to know from the cast and crew and to interact with fellow fans.,
As support for the franchise skyrocketed in the aftermath of the cancellation of Stargate Universe in 2010 and its final episodes aired the following year, joining Facebook groups and pages supporting for the return of the series and the franchise as a whole and even dedicated SG webpages are a must, especially for active fans of it and newbie fans, and also you can try joining their activities as well so as you can help bring back the beloved and popular sci-fi franchise.",How to Be a Stargate Fanatic," Either you become a part-time or full time fan, the thing is that you are gonna be a fanatic of the franchise in one way or another, and you'll enter the world of Stargate fandom in general.;
, Watching them can also bring you closer to the franchise.


To start it off, you better watch the 1994 Stargate movie starting Kurt Russell and James Spader, either on TV, on VCD or on DVD and Blu-ray. There is also a special edition on DVD and a special commemorative edition DVD and Blu-ray disc released in 2009 marking its 15th anniversary.






Continue with watching Stargate SG-1, the first of three television series of what would be the Stargate franchise, with 10 seasons. There are reruns of them in several television channels worldwide, and one can also watch the series on DVD. And as the series also had two direct-to-DVD movies produced (Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum), you may have to watch them as well.






Progress on with watching the animated series Stargate Infinity (1 season) and the two spin-off series Stargate Atlantis (5 seasons) and Stargate Universe (2 seasons) either on TV reruns or on DVD. SGA is also available on Blu-Ray as well so try buying it on that format.







, If you may, you have to focus first on either the movie or your favorite of the 3 television series to read on.


Check your local bookstore if a SG book is available, or online for any copies to be purchased. You can also try the Stargate Novels website for online purchase or to know what SG related novels to buy firsthand.







, Since 1999, the Gateworld webpage serves as the online hub of the entire franchise so check it out also for news, interviews with the cast and crew of all three television series and for its online encyclopedia of all 3 Stargate TV shows and even buy franchise-related goods and merchandise online. Stargate Wiki is another online encyclopedia for fans of the franchise, so make sure you register there.


Try having a Stargate theme username in the Internet so as to spread your love for the franchise to users globally.







, Avid Gaters use them while they talk to others. Include the following lines or phrases such as these in your conversations:


Oh for cryin' out loud! - Jack O'Neill
Godspeed - General George Hammond
Indeed. - Teal'c (If you say that line you can optionally raise your eyebrow like Teal'c)
Yee-haw! - General George Hammond
You know, lose it. It means, go crazy. Nuts, insane. Bonzo. No Longer in possession of one's faculties, Three fries short of a Happy Meal, WACKO!!!!! - Jack O'Neill
That's O'Neill, with two Ls. - Jack O'Neill
I'm confident - Daniel Jackson
Oh no! - Dr. Rodney McKay
That's Lieutenant Colonel errand boy to you. - John Sheppard
When there is time, there is hope. - Teyla Emmagan
Scenarios include: having to say Godspeed in cheering for favorite personalities or sports teams or saying farewell and in paying tribute for those who are deceased
Noticing someone drinking coffee and quoting Hammond's line ""For someone who just drank a cup of steaming hot coffee!"" in the process
saying the line ""With all due respect, Sir"" in formal conversations

, With the cancellation of the latest SG-related computer game Stargate: Resistance in 2011, the only PC game available now is the brand new and unofficial Stargate System Lords, based on Stargate SG-1 where one plays as a Goa'uld in the early years of the civilization. There's also the brand new game Stargate SG-1: Unleashed for iOS and later on Android and Steam, now available online. You can also buy SG-related card games online or at a local store.

, Reading the books, watching both the movie and the TV series (previously mentioned), and going online will help one increase his/her knowledge of the franchise. Things also to learn are the characters of both the movie and the subsequent television series.

, They can be bought either online or from real auctions and even from attics of fellow fans. Doing that will show others what you've progressed as a fan of the Stargate franchise.

, They can be both fun and a great way to appreciate the franchise and to celebrate the Stargate spirit in you. If you do, consider these:



Go in costume to these conventions. Either buy the costumes online or on a store, especially in a military store or make them yourself, and you'll do what Gaters are sometimes required to wear. Several characters wore United States Air Force and United States Marine Corps regulation uniforms so buy them from military outfit stores.
Be in character in these cons. As several of the characters in both the movie and the 3 TV series, as a military science fiction work, are military personnel from the United States Air Force (as well as the US Marine Corps) and it is set in the present day, act like them properly and in the right manner as real life military personnel do.

, Doing that will make you a contributor in the now ongoing campaign to save the Stargate franchise as a whole, especially the 3rd TV series of it, Stargate Universe, on which its cancellation and the subsequent 10 final aired episodes, most especially the finale cliffhanger episode on May of 2011 sparked the flames of fans who wanted the series to go on after its second season finale, which would turn out to be the finale of the series as a whole.

Dress like a gleek.,
Obsess over Glee.,
Make the world your stage.,
Talk about the characters like you know them, even if you're talking to a non-gleek.,
Know the actors.,
Decorate your room with all things Glee.,
Have fun with it!",How to Be a Gleek," This means anything a high-schooler would wear is fair game. Here are some ideas:



Rachel Berry. This preppy look places emphasis on bows, knee socks, cardigans, stripes and flats. Tina Cohen-Chang. Tina's goth look favors black boots, fingerless gloves, and dark, multicolored hair.

Mercedes Jones. This diva loves to wear loud patterns, bold colors, skinny jeans, and the occasional feather boa.

Quinn Fabray. When Quinn isn't in her cheerleading uniform, you can find her in a dress, pastel cardigan, and matching flats.

Kurt Hummel. Kurt's style is dressier than most of the Glee Club members. You can most often find him in a button down shirt, fitted pants, and a matching scarf. Flamboyant sweaters are another favorite.

Finn Hudson. Finn is a varsity jock. As a result, you can often wearing his football jersey or letter jacket with a pair of jeans.

Noah ""Puck"" Puckerman. Like Finn, Puck is a varsity jock, and dresses accordingly. However, his style is slightly different than Finn's—you can often find him in fitted black or grey jeans (though nowhere near as fitted as Kurt's!) and a T or button up shirt.;
, Make no plans for Thursday nights unless those plans include watching the latest episode. Tolerate no interruptions while you are watching. Watch the episode a second time within twenty four hours of it being aired. Watch it multiple times throughout the week. Get your family and friends hooked too!

, Whether your doing chores or out with your friends, find opportunities to break into song and dance.


Have a wide taste of music on your iPod/mp3 player. You should be well versed in Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, and Madonna as well as the songs from Broadway shows such as Wicked and Les Misérables. Journey, Victor Victoria, and Queen are also important.

,


Quote your favorite character(s)! You can always reply to someone with a good Glee quote. (Ex.: I carry a rape whistle!).

, To be a true gleek, you must know not only what's going on in the character's lives, but also in the lives of the actors who portray them. Follow them on twitter, or look them up online and in magazines.

, Posters, photos, and sheet music to your favorite songs are good places to start.


Take your photo with the ""loser"" sign. They're lots of fun to take and make! They're essential to every Gleek.

, Being a Gleek is all about the love of Glee.

For instance, the quick beats of tap dancing are very different from the long graceful moves of ballet dancing or the edgy movements of hiphop. Perhaps you could try ballroom dancing with a partner or even Irish dancing., Try watching different videos to understand the basics of different styles of dance. Maybe you don't have strong enough knees for tap dancing. Maybe you don't like how your feet need to bend in ballet dancing. See what draws you in.

, These books describe the basics of dancing, so they give you an idea of what you have ahead of you.


Try checking out magazines from the library. It's a free way to explore your options.
Dive into the history of dances. It may inspire you to choose one.

, Go see a live show in your local community. It doesn't have to be an expensive. Maybe your local college has a dance school. However, watching in person provides a different experience than watching a video. It sweeps you up in the performance.If you watch someone dance, you'll get a better feel for dancing. You'll see some great moves and get ideas from the pros. If you can't afford a live performance, try checking out movies with dancing, such as musicals. Pay attention to the dancers to see what they are doing. Are they focused? What is their technique like? Do their emotions complement the music? If you notice what inspires you in their movement, it may help you decide what you want to do.

, Many communities offer introductory dance classes. They can introduce you to variety of types at once. Check out your parks and recreation department or library.


If your community doesn't offer them, check out your local community colleges. Classes at community colleges are cheap.

, If you have good posture and can stretch your legs and point your toes, try classical ballet, not hip hop. When you research dances, make sure you know the body placements. See which ones you think you can do well. Always bear in mind, though, that you are learning. You can and will develop greater flexibility.

, While you can always branch out later, start with one type of dance first. Focus on learning that type of dancing before you move on to anything else.

, You need space to practice. Choose somewhere with a solid floor where you can make some noise.

, Many songs have dance remixes, but you can move to almost anything that has a steady beat.

, Some people have trouble hearing the beat. If that's you, try listening to the music at the beginning of a song. Ask someone who knows music to help you count the beats, tapping your foot in time. Once you get the hang of it, you can do it on your own., Once you feel the beat, try moving your body to it. You can worry about technique later. At this point in time, you just want to learn to move your body in time to the beat.You may want to start out by moving just your arms, then adding leg movements (or vice versa). It's easier to focus on one part. Really listen to the beat to be on time with the moves.

, Of course you want to immediately be an awesome dancer. However, dancing takes time to learn. If you try too much too soon, you could hurt yourself.

, Starting at the beginning will help you avoid frustration. It will improve your technique for more complicated moves. Use online tutorials or books to help you learn the basics.


For ballet, try the basic positions. For instance, begin in first position. First position is where your heels are together, but each foot points straight out to the side. It may take awhile to achieve this turnout, but use your hips to help you get into this position. Your arms should curve out from your shoulders in an arch., Dance clubs are a great place to try out certain types of dance moves, such as hip hop, country, or swing dancing.

, You may have taken a dance class to choose a genre, but now you should take one focused on the type of dance (or dances) you love. Once again, look for community classes or try your local community college. Pick a beginner class, since you're still learning.

, Watching professionals helps create a map in your brain. Essentially, by watching their movements, you are better able to make the movement yourself because your brain has already gone through the motions.You can take in a local performance, as above. Also, pay close attention to your instructor as she shows you how to make the movements.

, If you get friends to take the class together with you, you can spend time outside of class practicing together. That way, you can also provide feedback for each other. You can work on improving together., The only way to train your body is to practice on a regular basis. It will help your body develop muscle memory, so you can dance without having to think through the motions., Take a video of yourself, and watch it to see how you are moving. You can also try posting it on dancing sites to ask for tips from other dancers., Practicing in front of a mirror will let you see what you're doing wrong in real time, so that you're not practicing a move that's wrong., Check for local theater companies, and try out for one. You can also see if your community has any local dance groups you could join.


One way to find these types of groups is to check event listings in your newspaper. You can see who's performing to find local groups.

, These foods pack a punch when it comes to nutrients. Your body needs those vitamins and minerals to function properly, so eat your greens every day., If you're dancing constantly, you should get about half of your calories from carbohydrates. The other 50 percent should be split, with about 35 percent going to fat and 15 percent going to protein.The carbohydrates fuel your muscles for dancing, giving you energy.
Protein helps rebuild your muscles. In intense dance sessions, your muscles are stressed and the fibers break, which protein helps fix., Avoid white sugar, white bread, and white rice. Instead, choose whole grains and fruits for your carbohydrates., You need to replenish the fluids that your body is losing. In addition, being dehydrated can slow you down.Aim for 8 glasses of water a day that are 8 ounces each.
In an intense dance session, you should drink about 4 glasses of water per hour. to help make up for fluid loss., Try fish or chicken as your protein, as they are lower in saturated fat than red meats. You can also enjoy proteins from plants, such as nuts and beans., To help develop your body, try other exercises to increase your muscles and stamina.


For instance, swimming is a great all-body workout that can improve your flexibility. It also takes the stress off your joints. The backstroke is especially good if you need to loosen your upper body.To develop your leg muscles, try cycling. It's also a great way to increase your overall endurance. Make sure you sit up straight when riding because otherwise you can shorten muscles near the hips.For flexibility and strength, take a yoga class. Yoga can help lengthen your muscles, as well as strengthen your core., Lifting weights helps you to develop your muscles. You'll be able to stay in certain dance positions for longer, or move in ways you didn't think you could. You can do standard weightlifting such as bicep curls or leg squats, but only do sets of three with six or eight repetitions with a slightly heavier weight than you would normally use. More weight (but not as many repetitions) will help strengthen your body without adding too much weight in muscles to your body.For a bicep curl, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your palm should be facing inwards towards your body. Lift both arms slightly so that your palms are facing upwards. Alternate lifting each arm to your shoulder.For squats, stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Hold dumbbells in front of your body. Bend your knees at the same time, lowering yourself down, and then return to standing. Repeat the exercise."

Rock the audition.",How to Be a Contestant on Wheel of Fortune1," If you are unsure if you're eligible, go ahead and apply anyway -- you can ask specific questions later if the show contacts you about being a contestant.


If you have appeared on any version of Wheel of Fortune in the past, you are not eligible to reappear. Also, if you have appeared on a game/dating/relationship or reality show in the last year or three of these shows in the last decade, you also are ineligible. In addition, you will be turned down if you work for or are related to anyone who works for Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., the game show prize suppliers, or any TV station that broadcasts the show.;
, Visit the Wheel of Fortune site. In the blue navigation bar located under the header photo, hover over ""CONTESTANTS."" A pink drop-down menu will appear with several options. Click on ""Be A Contestant.""


The first question will appear, asking you about your age group. Click on either ""Adult,"" ""College Student,"" or ""Teen.""
Fill out the registration form completely and accurately.

, As an alternative to the form, Wheel of Fortune has started a ""Face of the Fan"" contest where prospective applicants send in a 60-second video to score an audition. This way, any person in any city can have a chance.


Visit their website for more information. Because a million people audition each year and only 600 or so are chosen, it is strongly encouraged that if you don't have video equipment to stick to sending in the application form.

, It's 39 feet (11.9 m) long, 13 feet (4.0 m) high and bright yellow. It rolls through cities, down highways and into America's heartland. Thousands of fans fill out applications and gather in front of the stage with a traveling version of the famous Wheel and Puzzle board. Applications are drawn at random throughout the event, calling individuals on stage in groups of five to participate in a brief interview, play a version of the Wheel of Fortune speed-up round and win special show-themed prizes.The most promising candidates are invited back to participate in final auditions for the show, usually held at a later date in the Wheelmobile host city.
If you want to be notified when the Wheelmobile comes to your area, you can fill out a form online to be notified. However, they do say that they may not be able to contact everyone., They're looking for players who clearly can have fun, are calm in front of the camera, and are good winners and losers. They want you to be decisive and logical in calling out letters and in strategy.


Energetic contestants with a sense of humor generally do the best. Of course, keeping a positive attitude is helpful, too. It's about having a good time, whether you win or lose., The auditions are often held in hotel ballrooms. The contestant coordinators bring about 70 wannabe contestants together and create a sort of mini version of ""Wheel of Fortune,"" complete with puzzles and a miniature wheel. All the participants take turns standing, calling out letters, and solving puzzles.


Then they take a 5 minute written test, consisting of 16 puzzles (where you have to fill in the missing letters). Afterward, they grade the tests and hand outdoor prizes. Then the coordinators tell some of the people to go home, while other people are allowed to stay and play more mock ""Wheel"" games (as the coordinators size them up). It all takes about two hours.
Unfortunately, even if you do make it past the first round, you still won't know the verdict when you finally do head home. You'll have to wait indefinitely to be contacted -- if you've been selected, that is. Whether you're chosen or not depends both on your test scores and on their impression of what kind of contestant you'd make."

Smile and have fun.,
Don’t drink too much.,
Don’t worry about what others are thinking.,
Avoid awkward or flashy moves.,
Dance with a partner or group of friends.",How to Dance Without Embarrassing Yourself1," The best way to avoid being embarrassed on the dance floor is to appear confident, even if you are not. Hold your head up and keep your back straight. This will give you a look of confidence. Make sure to always smile and enjoy yourself on the dance floor. This will make you appear confident in your dancing abilities.Avoid looking at the ground and hunching forward. This makes you seem shy and uncomfortable.;
, A drink or two can help to loosen you up and give you enough confidence to hit the dance floor. However, if you get too drunk, you may actually end up embarrassing yourself. When you are drunk your inhibitions are lowered and you are more likely to test out some new flashy dance moves. You will also have less control over your body and could bump into other people or fall on the ground., You may be nervous to dance because you’re worried that other people will judge your dance moves. You don’t need to be music-video ready to hit a dance floor at a bar or other social event. Just try to blend in with the crowd. Most people are too concerned about how they look while dancing to even notice your dancing style., If you are worried about embarrassing yourself while dancing, then you should stick to basic moves. Don’t try and pull off a wild move that you saw on your favourite dance competition show. Leave that to the professionals and stick to moves you know will look good. For example, avoid breakdancing, krumping, or any style of dance that may draw attention.Similarly, avoid flashy moves like the moonwalk. You probably won’t be able to pull it off with as much swagger as Michael Jackson.

, You are more likely to feel comfortable dancing if you are surrounded by your friends. This way you won’t feel like all eyes are on you. Similarly, if you dance with a partner, you can think about them rather than focus on whether or not people are judging you.If you are dancing in a group, make sure to respect the space of those around you. Avoid flailing your arms or stepping on other people’s toes.

Identify the beat of a song.,
Try moving your arms.,
Learn some basic footwork.,
Take dance lessons.",How to Dance Without Embarrassing Yourself2," In order to dance to music, you need to be able to identify the beat. Listen to a song and try and tap your foot or clap your hands along to the beat. Depending on the song, the beat may be slow or fast. When you are first learning to identify the beat, listen to music that has a strong drum beat. This will make it easier for you to hear the rhythm.For example, try dancing to Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"" or The Bee Gee's ""Night Fever."", Once you have identified the beat of the music, you can try moving your body to the beat. When you are first learning to dance, it is best to isolate different movements. Begin by keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground and move your arms to the beat of the song. You can move your arms from side to side or up and down.Your arms are also connected to your shoulders and torso, so try moving them as well.
Experiment with non-linear arm movements by creating waves.

, Now that your arms are moving to the music, try adding in your feet. You can start out simple, by picking up one foot and then the other, kind of like marching on the spot. As you get more comfortable you can try bending your knees and bouncing in time with the music. Continue to bounce and then add in steps to the side.Try to incorporate your hips and other parts of your lower body into your dance movement.

, Search online for dance studios in your area and research the different beginner classes available. Choose a dance style that you are interested in learning. For example, you could try hip hop, jazz, contemporary, ballroom, etc.Alternatively, if you are looking for something more casual, you could find a dance class at a local community centre or YMCA.
You can also watch instructional dance videos online or purchase one on DVD.

Try dancing by yourself.,
Wear loose and comfortable clothing.,
Practice in front of a mirror.,
Experiment with new moves.",How to Dance Without Embarrassing Yourself3," To get over your dancing jitters, practice your moves by yourself in a space that is free of any judgement. This way you will be able to fully commit to your movements and will begin to gain confidence in your dancing abilities. Make sure to always practice dancing with music playing.


Close yourself in your bedroom and clear a space so that you can dance freely without bumping into anything.
If you are worried about someone walking in while you are practicing, choose a time when you are home alone.

, You don’t want your movement to be restricted by a tight skirt or pants. You are also likely to work yourself into a sweat, so avoid clothing that will leave you feeling hot or constrained. Instead, choose comfortable and flowing clothing that will not impact your ability to let loose., Dancing in front of a mirror allows you to see how you look while dancing. You may feel embarrassed to dance, but after watching yourself in a mirror realize that you are not as bad as you expected. Alternatively, you may find that some of your movements look awkward and you can work on improving that aspect of your dancing.Using a mirror will allow you to pinpoint the area that needs to be improved in order to give you more confidence on the dance floor.
Use a full length mirror so that you can see your entire body.
Perform a variety of moves so that you can get an idea of what looks good.

, Once you have learned and practiced some basic dance moves and you are comfortable moving to the beat, you can play music and just experiment with different movements. Have fun and be yourself."

Feel the beat.,
Move with the ""ridim."",
Move your hips in a rhythmic motion.,
Grab a partner or two.,
Express yourself!.,
Practice with classic reggae tunes.,
Try skanking.,
Try the doing ""the rock."",
Try doing a ragga-style twist.,
Try doing a ""wine up"" dance for a modern twist.",How to Dance Reggae," Reggae music usually uses a steady, mid-tempo beat — perfect for newcomers to the style. To start, play some reggae music and try to pick out the beat. As you do this, count along with the flow of the music from one to four. Your counting should match up with the rhythm or ""feel"" of the song — for most reggae songs, this isn't too hard. When you reach four, start over from one again. You should sound like this: ""One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one..."" (and so on.)


Reggae music almost always has a strong offbeat rhythm. For our purposes, this usually means that you should hear the steady strum of a guitar or a repeating piano chord between your numbers as you count them. In other words, your counting should sound like this: ""One (strum), two (strum), three (strum), four (strum),"" and so on.
If you're having a hard time counting in time with the music, listen to the drums in the song. Most reggae drumming has a strong ""hit"" on beats ""two"" and ""four"".;
, Once you've got a feel for the beat of your reggae song, start to move! Start swaying from side to side with the ""ridim"" (""rhythm,"" in Jamaican patois) of the song. Bob your head up and down and lean from side to side, turning your shoulders as you do so. Try to match up your movements with each beat of the song — in other words, lean right on ""one"", lean left on ""two"", lean back again on ""three"", and so on. Don't be shy — the only way to learn how to dance is to start doing it!


When you're comfortable with a basic swaying or leaning motion, try swinging your arms back and forth with the music. You can leave your hands at your sides while you do this, but you can also try bringing your hands up to chest level and moving them rhythmically with the music — it's up to you.

, Dancing reggae is all about ""wining"" (""winding""). Once you've found the groove of the music and are comfortable with your basic leaning and swaying motion, try moving your hips. To start, roll your hips in a circular, rhythmic, ""hula hoop"" motion along to the beat of the music. Try to match each rotation of the hips to every beat (or every other beat) of the song — this should feel natural.


Note that this movement is usually more pronounced for women — men on the dance floor usually use more subdued motion of the hips.

, What fun is dancing on your own? Like most other forms of dance, reggae dance is a highly social experience. Try practicing your moves alongside a few other people. Once you start to feel the groove of the song, you should naturally start to split off into groups or partners — don't be afraid to single out someone on the dance floor for one-on-one dancing.


Traditional reggae partner dancing is somewhat similar to ballroom dancing, but the partners usually stand close to each other (or with bodies touching) and, obviously, make rhythmic hip movements.
Modern reggae dancing may more closely resemble hip-hop or pop dancing and incorporate a female-back-to-male-front stance.

, The key to reggae music isn't following a strict set of rules — it's all about just relaxing and doing what feels natural. There's no one ""right way"" to dance to reggae music — the way you move to the music should be an expression of how you feel. Approach the dance floor with an open attitude, try to focus on the music, and let your body do the rest of the work.


As you express yourself, however, be sure to share the dance floor. In reggae, the dance floor is a public space — something for everyone to enjoy. While particularly good dancers may get the attention of the crowd for a while, they shouldn't hog or command the dance floor.

, Need some listening material to get in the reggae mindset? Try listening to some old-school (also called ""roots"") reggae. This classic style is great for reggae beginners because it's usually smooth, medium-tempo, and has a strong back beat, making it extra-easy to feel the ""ridim"" of the song. Below are just a few reggae artists associated with the roots reggae movement that you may want to investigate:John Holt
Culture
Israel Vibration
The Abyssinians
Gregory Isaacs
Sylford Walker

, One dance move that's indelibly associated with ska and several other reggae-related musical offshoots is ""skanking."" Skanking basically looks like a quick, exaggerated marching or running-in-place movement that uses small kicks for every step. Be careful — once you're skanking at a high tempo, it's easy to kick or run into someone if you're not paying attention. To try skanking, use the following steps:Ball your fists up and start marching in place to the tempo of the music, moving your hands up and down as you go.
Start sliding your feet back along the floor after each step. This should make it look a little like you're running in place.
Start kicking your feet out with each forward step you take, continuing to make your exaggerated marching movements with your arms. When you get it right, your skanking should look a little like a cross between the can-can and an old-fashioned jig.

, This dance move is remarkably simple — practically anyone can do it. With its slow, smooth movements, the rock pairs best with mellower reggae and dancehall tunes. To do the rock, use the following steps:


Begin by grooving and swaying to the music as you normally would.
Loosely ball your fists and bring your hands up to your chest. Start to roll each shoulder back to the beat of the song — first the right, then the left, and so on.
Continue this leaning, rocking movement, exaggeratedly (but smoothly) rolling your shoulders back with each beat. Roll your hips slightly and make pointing or gesturing hand motions for added effect.

, Ragga music, a more upbeat, intense variation of reggae and dancehall music, often uses dance moves that are inspired by modern hip-hop dance. This means lots of ""popping,"" ""locking,"" ""dropping,"" and more! For a great go-to ragga dance move, use the steps below:


Plant your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Raise your arms out from your sides with your fists and forearms pointing down to the ground.
Twist at the waist as far as you can comfortably go to one side. Start to slowly, smoothly twist back in the opposite direction, keeping your arms out as you go.
Roll your hips back and forth to the beat of the music in an exaggerated motion as you twist. Repeat back in the other direction or transition into another move when you can't twist any further.

, If you've listened to modern dance hits inspired by Jamaican music, you've probably heard this phrase used in the lyrics or shouted over the music as part of an ad-lib. This wine-up dance move, with its provocative, suggestive movements, is intended mainly for women to use (although, if you're a man and you'd like to try it, go ahead!) Use these steps to give it a shot:


Plant your feet about foot or two apart and relax your body. Start grooving to the rhythm of the music as you normally would.
Place your hands on your hips and start to roll them in a circular motion. As you roll your hips to the front, tighten your stomach muscles, and as you roll your hips to the back, stick them out.
If you can, start to open and close your legs to the beat of the music, touching your knees together on each beat (or every other beat).
For added flair, throw in occasional swiveling movements of the head and shoulders to accompany your hip and leg movements.

Prepare your team.,
Get into position.,
Ready the arms.,
Lift!,
Hold the lift.,
Get down.",How to Do a Dance Lift," You'll need the right team to achieve the lift:


One dancer to be lifted- this dancer must have optimal core strength.

Two dancers to do the lifting- they must contain some upper arm strength to provide a base, as well as core strength.
One dancer in the back added to the lifting team to stabilize and help the person being lifted into the air. This girl is optional, but does make things easier.;
,


The lifted dancer should be in the front and middle, with all dancers facing the same direction. Two lifters should be to the side and with the optional one directly behind.
The lifted dancer must stand with their feet in first position.

The two lifters must stand with their feet shoulder width apart, slightly offset.
The back lifter should be standing in second position.

,


The lifted dancer should have their arms out in a strong second position, pushing the shoulders down and back, to create the necessary opposition to sustain the lift.
The side lifters should have one hand near the armpit, as if creating a shelf, and one hand comfortably between the wrist and elbow.
If the optional lifter is there, their hands should be firmly gripping the lifted dancer’s waist.

,


The lift should come from the knees. All participants should have set counts in their head for preparation, plié and lift.
The lifted dancer must actively jump into the air as she is lifted, as her own momentum will help her get into the air. She must then hold her body tight and in the proper position.
The side lifters must come from underneath the arms and push up.

, The lift may last as long or as short as desired.


Counts must be agreed upon so everyone is in sync with what they are supposed to be doing, be it walking or holding still.
The lifted dancer must hold their arms and body incredibly tight and in the desired position.
The lifters should hold their arms locked straight, as it helps make the most of their strength and makes the lift easier.

,


Finishing the lift must end in sync. One side cannot go down before the other.
The lifted dancer must be ready to be put down.
As always, agree upon counts to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Restrain yourself from laughing, pointing, or jeering.,
Stay confident about yourself.,
Use your skills to make your partner look good.,
Give your dance partner a chance.,
Suggest learning away from the crowd.,
Flirt instead.,
Encourage your partner to loosen up.,
Don't sweat it.,
Be polite.,
Maintain the sense of fun.",How to Dance With a Bad Dancer," If your dance partner is as bad as you think, then it's likely that it took a great deal of courage, bravado, or confidence to even get on the dance floor in the first place. Having fun poked at them won't ease the situation. Do your best to pull yourself together and take this in your stride.;
, You don't need to reduce your own dancing skills just to match with those of your partner. Instead, you'll need to think about how you can ""work around"" your dance partner's uninspiring dance moves while still showing off your usual thing. Realize that you're a role model, an example to be followed, so bear this in mind when you're dancing and hope that your partner's concentrating on learning a thing or two from you.

, If it's a slow dance, lead. If it's structured, turn it free-form. Think about it, what others see is the whole. If your partner is good looking and you're having a good time, what they see is a moving double figure in a slow dance. Pay attention to what they do worst and try to emphasize moves they enjoy or pick up from you. If you turn your skills to the exercise of making your partner look good, you can help her or him to overcome anxiety, loosen up and dance better. This works great in free form dancing - very often an inexperienced partner will literally imitate what you're doing. You can almost hypnotize them into keeping pace with the music. So do the moves you want her or him to pick up, repeat a couple of times, and guide if they're not in tempo to the music. Watch to see how long it takes for them to pick it up. If you focus your skill on making them look good, it will work to help them and also to keep you feeling good about your skills.

, Perhaps your date has never had a chance to dance with someone as good as you before; perhaps your partner has never danced at all before. Don't make assumptions about your partner's reticence – at this stage, it might be a good opportunity to ask about their dance experience and to gently probe as to whether they're keen to learn how to improve.



Be kind, be caring, and be facilitative. It might be that your partner has an attack of the nerves trying to do the salsa but is perfectly fine at free-for-all dance without any direction. It could just be a case that you need to meet on a dance-floor doing a dance both of you feel comfortable with.

Don't be afraid to ask how long your partner has danced a certain type of complicated dance, like the ballroom dances. This can provide a great opportunity for an enlightening discussion about the difficulties of the dance steps and lead to more understanding from you as to where your partner is at in terms of learning (or not).


, It can be embarrassing having to learn dance steps or moves in front of others, and it's recommended that you never try to teach a person on the dance-floor there and then. Your partner's willingness to learn from you will all depend on his or her own level of confidence and enthusiasm, so gauge it from the context and the personality of your partner. For example, teaching your partner a few steps at a family wedding where everyone's friendly might not be so intimidating whereas teaching a few steps in the middle of the nightclub where everyone's trying to maintain their cool will freak them out. Remember that it's always preferable to do any ""teaching"" in private.


One non-evident method of teaching is to encourage your partner to take your lead. Simply keep showing the way and making it very, very easy for your partner to follow literally in your footsteps, including holding and steering them where appropriate. You might need to be patient but if your partner is willing to follow, then you will both get somewhere constructive with kind instruction.

If your partner is someone with whom you're intending to remain romantically attached, why not suggest dance classes. That way, you have more excuses for dates together and a chance for someone whose job it is to instruct in dance to get the points across more clearly than maybe you can. And if they still hate dancing, it will be the instructor's fault, not yours.


, If your partner is a romantic interest, use flirting as a subtle means to direct your partner's steps and moves. For example, you might want them to move toward the outer part of the crowd where the dastardly dance moves aren't so noticeable, and you could make suggestive eye movements and head nods, as well as gently pulling your partner to the outer edge. Once there, try kissing if you're intimate, as that's often a great way of getting close enough to help direct the other person's movements.


While flirting, quietly and reassuringly throw in a few dance moves tips that seem ""off the cuff"" as you're nuzzling or fluttering your eyes at one another. Make it seem that you don't care that much and that you just want to dance together. While showing your nonchalance, simply steer the bad dancer in the directions you need them to take!


, Bad dancers tend to make repetitive moves, using only arms and legs and not involving the whole body.Again, simply leading by example, show your partner a variety of moves that change direction and moves all parts of the body. You might even consider grabbing their waist or hips and helping them to swivel around a little more, with some encouraging pep-talk such as ""Doesn't it feel great when you do this?"".

, So your partner dances with octopus legs. It's likely there are things you can't do so well either and they may be things your partner excels at. In this case, a little give and acceptance from you on the dance-floor front might earn you brownie points when you're too scared to leap off the bungee bridge your partner jumps from regularly or to try a strange new unidentifiable food your partner insists tastes delicious. If you make a fuss about this, your partner has every right to make an equal fuss about something else you're not so great at, so maintain a compassionate perspective.


It's best not to go on about it not even as a tease. If you harp on about your partner's lack of dancing ability or tease your partner too much, this may cause him or her to lose interest in dancing with you at all.


, Thank your partner after a dance. This reinforces that you appreciated the effort and that you liked dancing with this person. That in itself may be enough to encourage them to try harder next time and to not feel so self-conscious when giving it a go.

, Above all, keep the entire dance experience fun, so that it doesn't seem a drag or imposition on either of you. There are worse things in the world than being with a bad dancer and making a meal out of it will only cause the other person to think you're uptight, difficult, or mean-spirited. Laugh it off, have fun with your own dancing, and show by example that dancing is a fun pastime that is worth giving a good chance.

, Your palms should be resting against the ground by your head.Another version is that you do it on your elbows.Try both ways and see the one you are most comfortable about.


If you experience difficulties with the actions first, it may be easier to place your hands about 6 inches (15cm) away from your head rather than right next to it.

,,


You may need to sway three or four times and then kick your legs forward. The swaying builds up momentum.

, Now swing your hands forward while your feet touch the ground.

, If you find you lack the strength, use your hands to push off from initially, until you are more practiced.You can also try to fall into a horse-stance or front-stance as the name is in karate(horse-stance is for kung fu) and then push get up.


When you land, you don't want to put all your force on your feet––you want to keep on moving your upper body so that you land it without falling back. If you do all this right you will for sure land it in five to six tries.

If the show is a competition, decide on the rewards for the winners. Make a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place with tiered awards. Consider making a winner for each performance category.
Create a judging criteria. If you have judges, create categories and a point system. For example, 20 points for originality, 20 points for costume, etc. Create penalties for exceeding the time limit to keep the competition fair.;
, The budget is the lifeline of your show. You will have to host your show at a venue, advertise for it, and buy supplies. Determine the size of your show and how large the budget needs to be to make it successful.


Find sponsors to help raise money to host the show and provide awards.
Application fees and ticket sales will help pay back your initial expenses.
Set a spending limit for each show category such as advertising and rental fees.

, Assemble a group of community members - such as parents, local business owners, and teachers - and form a committee. This committee will help plan, promote, and organize the talent show.An organizational committee will not only help take the pressure off of you, but will also give you support in emergencies.
Designate a treasurer to keep track of your budget and expenses.

, Think about the size of your show. You want to be able to accommodate the size of your audience. If the show is small and the performers require minimal technical assistance, then a small meeting hall is the best. Larger halls require more advanced technical setups with PA systems.


Find a local school or theater to host the event. If you work with a place that already has the venue, contact the person in charge of its schedule.
Remember your audience. Depending on the venue you choose, you will have the provide adequate seating. If you choose an empty hall, for instance, you have the choice to set up rows of folding chairs or tables for the audience to sit. , Set your date as soon as possible. You want to make sure your venue is available and secure it. Plan your date around other major events the show’s participants might have. For instance, if your show is full of students, then you want to plan around tests.

, You will need people who are not performing or judging to help run the show. You will need stagehands and a stage manager, sound and light operators, and judges (if it is competitive) at the very least. Recruit people in the community who want to help but do not want to perform.It’s important to think about every aspect of your show. You will need people to set-up, run the show, attend to the audience, and clean up.
Host a tech training day. Some people without technical experience may wish to help with the technical aspects of the show. Holding a technical training day will help them gain experience and be able to help run your talent show.

, Applications keep records of the participants as well as set parameters and legal agreements. This helps you organize participants according to the show's categories and keep track of their technical needs. Indicate anything that is unacceptable for your show. For example, if you do not want nudity or pyrotechnics, stipulate that on the application.


Make sure participants under 18 get the signatures of their legal guardians to participate.
List the categories of the talent show so that the participants can check where their performance falls under.
Charge an application fee to create a larger reward and to help with the costs of running the show.
Indicate when the prizes will be disbursed.

List the application fee if there is one.
Specify if you want them to be in their stage apparel.
Provide relevant contact information in case anyone has questions about their act or your show.

, You will want to book a spot where everyone can perform their act at full volume with plenty of space. Choose a time that works well for both the judges and performers. For instance, if the judges work during the day or the performers got to school, hold the auditions on a weeknight or on the weekend.


Any off-site hall, dance studio, or gym makes a great spot to hold auditions .
Do not use someone’s home. You will not be able to hold the amount of people auditioning, and you will bringing strangers into your house. If anything goes wrong, then the owner of the home can be held liable. Make sure the performers have a space where they can wait and practice before their audition.

, Have a check-in sheet. This will help you keep track of the how many people are auditioning and allow you to schedule their audition times.

, This schedule will be based on how many people have arrived and signed in. Let the performers know when they will be auditioning so they can leave and come back if necessary. , This gives everybody an equal amount of time. This will also keep the schedule on track. Use a light or sound to let the participant know when their time is up.

, You need to get the word out so you have an audience! There are many ways to advertise. Make fliers that let people know the time, date, and location of the show. Be sure to list the type of performers you will have to create excitement.


Advertise well in advance for you show so people can make plans to attend.
If you know someone who is great at graphic design, then recruit them! This can be a very cost-effective way to make professionally designed flyers.
Place flyers at local universities, performance spots, and coffee shops to attract not only an audience but performers as well. If you are selling tickets, advertise where they can be purchased. If you are selling tickets ahead of time or online, be sure to include that information.

, Create a Facebook Page, Twitter, and Google+ account for your show. Send reminders amount the date and time. Highlight the performers to generate buzz.


Find a local community member who is willing to build website for your show that provides all the details for the event. If you have enough funds, consider hiring someone for this purpose.

, This line will be used to answer any questions a performer or an audience member might have.


Have volunteers answer the line. Make sure you set hours for the hotline so that the volunteers are no overworked.

, Tell everyone you know and encourage them to do the same. The more excitement you show, the more likely they are to tell others about your talent show. This is one of the very best, and most cost-effective, ways to advertise your talent show.

, Make sure everyone arrives at the venue an hour to and and hour and a half early. That way you have time to deal with any major issues before the show.


Use this time to go over all the logistics of the show with your committee and volunteers.
Make sure that everybody is informed of any last minute changes.
Create an emergency phone line. Either purchase a new line or designate someone’s phone for emergency calls. Keep this number separate from your informational line. This line will be for performers who are running late or unable to attend.

, Assemble the tech crew to make sure the lights and sound are working. Check with the backstage manager that all the performers have arrived and are backstage preparing for their routine.


Have the tech crew check the lights. Make sure to have replacements bulbs in case any lights are out.
Have the tech crew check the sound also. Have replacement cables and back-up equipment in case something does not work.
Make sure the performers have everything they need for their act such as musical instruments, laptops, or screens.

, Place a small table at the main entrance of your venue. Have two volunteers work the booth. They will collect tickets from people who bought their tickets in advance. They will also sell tickets.


Have a cash box with plenty of change. Make sure the treasurer keeps track of how much money is in the box before and after to check that against the amount of tickets sold.

, Decide on what kind of food you want to sell before the show. Pre-packaged snacks require far less effort than selling hot food. If you wish to serve hot food, you will have much more to clean and prepare.


Comply with the local ordinances to avoid being fined. You will most likely need someone with food safety training to handle the food. You will also have to comply with fire safety requirements.
Bring disposable utensils and dishes so you do not have to wash dishes. Provide a place to recycle them.
Bring cleaning supplies, such as wiping cloths and a bucket to rinse them in. Use bleach in the bucket water to keep them clean.
Have a cash box for the food stand as well.

, Have the Master of Ceremonies start the show and introduce the performers. Take this time to enjoy the performers, but be ready to handle any questions or situations as they arise.


Make sure you have an announcer or M.C. to engage the audience in between acts. This will keep the audience engaged and give the stagehands time to set up the next act.

, Make sure to clean the venue after the show is over. If you have a volunteer staff, gather them together as everyone is leaving. You want to leave the venue in better shape than when you arrived.


Designate teams to clean certain areas. This will make cleaning faster and more organized.

As teachers are already engaged in the creative arts, it’s natural for them to be involved in your show.
In addition, students can see by their instructors’ enthusiasm that their school is committed to developing their overall quality of life, as well as their curriculum.;
, If teachers or administrators are reluctant to sanction a talent show, argue that such initiatives can have tangible academic benefits.


Research shows that pursuing an interest in creative arts reduces feelings stress and anxiety and increases positive emotions.Children are more likely to score higher on college entrance exams if they participate in four or more years of artistic study outside of their regular classes., The content of the performances, dress code, and hours of operation should be taken into account when scheduling and selecting the acts.Each school’s code of conduct differs, but mature content and dress will probably be prohibited.
You may also have to obtain permission for utilizing school grounds after hours for planning, rehearsing, or putting on the show.

, Running any event is a huge amount of work and nobody can do it alone. You need a team of reliable people to help you.


Make a list of everything you need help with and assign volunteers to work on each item. This can be everything from selling tickets to promotions, set-building, lighting, stewarding, and backstage logistics.
If a role is particularly vital, have a back-up person to help if something goes wrong at the last minute.
Don’t be afraid to delegate. Trust your volunteers and assign them enough help to accomplish their tasks., Beginning to plan several months from the show date is usually ideal to let guests clear their schedules in advance. Four to six months should be plenty of time.


If RSVP’s are required, you’ll need to determine a timeline for that as well, as the RSVP date will need to be included on the flyers and invitations.

, You’ll want a great turnout, so you won’t want anyone to miss the show by being out of town.


Some students might not have transportation during the evenings or weekends, so it’s crucial to keep the show as close to school hours as possible.

, Both students and parents will be more likely to attend if you’re aware of the other activities going on each week.


Coordinate with the school’s administrators to avoid conflicts with other school events such as athletics, other performances, or faculty meetings.

, The school itself will be easiest for everyone to access, and everyone will feel more comfortable in a familiar space.


An auditorium or gym are large enough for a sizable audience and have plenty of room for a make-shift stage.
The parking lot, school grounds, or a sports field can be used as long as weather permits.

, If you can’t host the event at your school, many facilities will be willing to help a local school if you can demonstrate that the event will be efficiently run and will benefit the community as a whole.

, Project all of your possible costs, including the venue, technical aspects such as lighting or sound, transportation, and compensating any staff involved in setup or cleanup.


Include any assets you are able to gain either from the school or from outside donations.
Allocate the right amount of funds for each budget item. If any one item is significantly more expensive than the others, you may need to review whether it is necessary., Parents of students participating in the show will want to support their kids, as will their friends.Place donation jars in the school’s main offices, classrooms, or cafeteria.

, If you are having trouble meeting the costs of putting on the talent show, a small ticket fee might be your best option., This can be a big addition to your workload, but if you still have outstanding costs you might find it necessary., The student body, teachers, and parents should be the first to get the details about the show. Sending an invitation home can provide a good reminder, and encourage parents to get involved.


Include clear information about the dates for the auditions, RSVP, and the show itself. Also highlight the location, theme, and contact information, and give credit to sponsors or donors.

, Use this as a fun DIY project that can get students involved with their own artwork and writing., Perhaps the most direct way to spread the word, seeing their instructors excited about the show will make the students even more excited to participate or attend.

, Many schools have incorporated the use of social media in classrooms, so take advantage of its speed and efficiency to advertise your event.


Not only students, but parents, are active on social media. Instead of parents having to ask what their children are up to on a daily basis, it’s more effective to show them., Mass e-mails to the student body and parents can serve as a quick method of communication. As the date of the show approaches, this might be the best way to send a quick reminder., Even if you intend to let everyone that wants to be involved perform, it is a good idea to hold an audition to see what they intend to do for yourself.Once you’ve seen the acts for yourself, you can suggest modifications to their performances or costumes to ensure that they conform with school rules and time restrictions.Doing this early in the process allows for plenty of time to make any necessary modifications.

, Allow each act the same amount of time to perform. About 5 minutes should be enough.


Consider the flow of the acts. Is it a good idea to put a rock band on after a romantic monologue from Shakespeare? Also, try to schedule a high-energy performance to end the show.
You can use the schedule as the basis for a program to pass out to audience members at the beginning of the show.

, They need to have enough stage presence to engage the audience during transitions between the acts, and enough poise to handle any awkward moments or unplanned interruptions to the show.


Consider a principal or teacher. If the school has a drama or performance program, a student not involved in one of the acts might be a good choice.
Make the MC’s duties clear from the outset. They will need to make an opening speech and introduce each act, so provide them with a copy of the schedule as soon as it is available., If so, will there be judges and prizes? How will you score the acts and display the results? Does this effect the format of your show or the running order?

, Holding a test-run of the show about two weeks before the public performance will allow you to get a better sense of the timing, flow, and work out possible complications. It will also give the kids a chance to practice their acts onstage., You will need to be on the spot to organize your volunteers, guide guests and performers, and answer questions.

, You might be tempted to become personally involved in each task, but as long as each individual or group has been fully informed of their job, you can circulate among them to ensure they are not overwhelmed., Run tests of the lighting and sound equipment. Check to make sure that any sets or props are in place and ready to be moved onstage. As students arrive, verify that they have any necessary costumes or equipment with them.Remember that you can delegate any of these tasks to volunteers, instead of trying to do them all yourself.

, This creates the right energy backstage and allows you to thank performers or congratulate them on coming this far. It also helps build confidence before an act., The MC will be in charge of most of what happens onstage during the show, but you can provide help from backstage.


Make sure that members of upcoming acts are ready and waiting to go on.
Make a plan with the MC to provide support for students who forget lines or get stage fright.
If any of the student performers are too frightened to go onstage at their scheduled time, move their act to later in the show and bring on the next act. While the student waits to go on, give them a pep talk, remind them of how well they did in the audition or rehearsal, and make sure that their friends encourage them., Don’t allow acts to overrun. Losing five minutes here and there will lead to you falling seriously behind schedule. You also run the risk of losing momentum and boring your audience., Many teachers and school staff members probably helped you put on your show. Make a list of these people in advance and remember to thank them in a genuine way at the end of the show.You might consider presenting volunteers with a small gift or flowers, or asking them to come on stage at the end of the show for a round of applause.

, Whether you’re using a school building or an outside facility, you don’t want to leave a mess. Supervise your volunteers or the facility’s staff in cleaning up the building and breaking down any lighting, sets, or equipment you used in the show."

Start by determining how you will organize the participants in the quiz show. Ask yourself, Will the participants compete as a team or as individuals?You may think about how many participants you would like to have in the competition and then determine if teams or individual competitors makes more sense. Having large teams may be fun if there are going to be a lot of participants, while individual competitors may be ideal if there are only going to be a handful of participants.
You may opt for teams if you are trying to get the participants used to working as a group. This may be a good way to encourage social interaction among friends or teamwork among a class of students.
You may also break up the quiz show into sections or heats, where teams compete against each other in heats. Then, whichever teams win the heats face each other in the final round of the competition.;
, You should also establish rules for the quiz show so the participants know what to expect when they play. You may create strict rules around how competitors play against each other, including pressing a buzzer or raising a hand when they have the answer to a question. You may also note how the competitors earn points in the quiz show.For example, you may have a rule where the competitors earn five points for every question they answer correctly. Then, if there is a tie at the end of the competition, there is a sudden death match where competitors answer difficult questions as fast as they can.
You may also allow for the stealing of points from an opposing team if a team member does not answer a question within a certain timeframe.

, As the person in charge of organizing the quiz show, you should compile the content for the competition ahead of time. You may use materials from the class to create the content for the competition, such as names and dates of a historical period or questions on a reading assignment done in the class. Or you may use materials from other sources, such as scholarly journals or pop culture articles, to create content for the quiz show.You may decide to include a mix of easy questions and difficult questions in the content so the competitors can still be challenged and have fun. Having a variety of questions can also keep the competition interesting and engaging for any spectators in the room.

, You may decide to volunteer as the host of the quiz show, especially if you are in charge of running the competition. Make sure you are comfortable speaking in front of a crowd and able to keep the energy up in the room during the competition. You should also be unbiased and show no preference for any of the participants, even if they are your students or your close friends.

, If you do not want to be the host of the quiz show, you may ask a friend who is outgoing and comfortable in front of people to be the host. Having a live host who is full of energy can help keep the competition fun and upbeat.


You may ask a friend who is known for being social, outgoing, and extroverted to host the show for you. Or you may ask a colleague, such as another teacher or professor, to be a guest host.

, Regardless of who agrees to host the competition, you want to make sure they will be confident, engaging, and upbeat. They should have good public speaking skills and be comfortable with presenting questions to the competitors. They should also be able to keep the pace of the quiz show brisk and quick so the competitors and the audience stay engaged in the show.You may also want a host who is willing to let competitors know when they got a question wrong or failed to come up with a right answer. They should do this with tact and then move on to the next question or allow the other team to answer. This will keep the pace of the show on track and make sure the show does not feel slow or boring.

, If you are comfortable using technology, you may use an existing quiz show program in your competition. These programs have been designed by expert programmers to make putting on a quiz show as easy as clicking your mouse.You may look for a quiz show program that contains content that relates to your class or your area of interest for the competition. Or you may add in your own content into a quiz show template and upload it into the program, creating a quiz show game you can run on a computer.

, You can also try creating your own quiz show using a computer program. Programs like Adobe Flash can be used to build a quiz show. This may be a good option if you are tech savvy and confident with using computer programs to design a quiz. You may also go for this option if you want to teach yourself how to design a quiz on the computer.


When building the game show, make sure you include interactive elements, such as buttons that trigger audio prompts and a running total of the competitor’s score on the screen. You could also give the participants the option of entering text into the quiz to answer questions.

, Using a computer in a quiz show can create technical errors or issues. Make sure you run through the quiz show on the computer on your own first to test the content and the functionality of the quiz. You may test the quiz show on the computer you are planning to use during the actual quiz show, such as a school computer or your home computer, to ensure everything runs smoothly.


When you are testing the quiz show, put yourself in the position of a competitor and check that all of the functionality makes sense. Test any interactive parts of the quiz and make sure functionality like a score counter or a timer on the screen are working properly.
If you decide to use the computer program quiz in a live setting, you may also store the quiz answers in a sealed envelope. You may also have a live host who will read out the scores to the participants as they appear in the quiz show.

, To have a successful quiz show competition, you need to have enthusiastic participants. Enlist participants in your classroom, your office, or in your group of friends. Let the participants know when the quiz show competition is going to be held and what will be expected of them as competitors. You may also break the participants into teams in advance so they can practice together before the competition.


You may give the participants sample questions to help them prepare for the competition. You may include a range of difficult and easy sample questions so the participants can get a taste of what they will be quizzed on.
You may also enlist spectators for the show so the competition feels more like a real quiz show. You can get spectators for the show by asking students at school to attend or other friends in your social network.

, You should create a space that is big enough for all the competitors, the host, and the audience. This could be a large hall at school, the classroom, or a large room in your home. Set up an area for the competitors to face each other and compete, complete with tables and buzzers. Put out chairs for the spectators. You can also set up a microphone for the host so they can be heard by the spectators.


You may also create a scoreboard that can be placed behind the participants so the spectators can see it. You can display the prizes as well so everyone knows what is at stake.

, You should have the host run the quiz show in a professional, helpful way. Make sure the host introduces the quiz show, briefly explains the rules, and introduces each team or individual competitor. They should act as a guide for the competitors and be able to answer any questions competitors may have about the quiz show.The host should also do recaps throughout the quiz show to let competitors know where they stand in the competition. For example, they may end each round of play by reading out the scores of each team or individual competitor. They may also let competitors know when they are falling behind and encourage them to try to catch up to the lead scorer.

, The host should also make a point of getting everyone involved in the game show, from the participants to the spectators. They may encourage the spectators to cheer for their favorite teams or competitors. They may also have individuals from the audience act as a phone a friend or a lifeline for a competitor if they struggle with a question.To get the spectators more involved, the host may also poll them and ask them to answer a question for the competitors. Or they may have the spectators choose the sudden death match topic for the competitors.

, You should reward the winners of the quiz show with prizes, as this will make the show feel more like a competition. You may give the winners a physical prize, such as the latest gadget or a book on the subject matter discussed in the quiz show. If you can afford it, you may even give the winners a cash prize.You can also give the winners an experience as their prize, such as a trip to a museum that focuses on a topic or issue discussed in the quiz show. You may also buy the winning team or competitor dinner to reward them for their hard work.

Find a talent that seems cool and learn everything you can about it. Find out what it takes and see what you've got. If you never try, you'll never know. You’re not going to find a talent without trying. You can only find your natural abilities, skills, and talents when you test your mettle and actively seek new experiences. Face down obstacles and seek out challenges to see what innate skills and abilities you might be hiding.


Make it your goal to try something new every week. You might not discover something that you're super-talented at, but maybe you pick up a guitar one day and find out it feels comfortable in your hands and decide to learn more. Maybe you discover an ability to connect with animals at the shelter, something you'd never experienced before. Maybe you learn you're an ace at the Star Trek: The Next Generation pinball machine at the laundromat. That's the start of talent.Get outside and scrape your knees. Go on adventures and experience the world in its natural habitat. Try out different sports, outdoor hobbies like fishing, hiking, and climbing to see if you've got an untapped natural ability or an instinct for it.;
, What comes naturally to you? What do you do without thinking? What do you love? Look to your obsessions and your interests for the possibility of talent. If you love to spend all day doodling, reading, or dancing, there's no point in wasting time wishing you had a talent for baking. Focus on the talents you do have by focusing on what comes easiest to you.


If you're in school, what homework comes most easily to you? What worries you the least? That might clue you in to natural talents.
Pay attention to what other people might have noted about you. It’s common that others might have a keener sense of what you're good at than you will yourself. Ask your family, your friends, and your teachers to help you figure out what you make look easy.

, Does the stage frighten you, or maybe public speaking? Writing a story and finishing it? Grab the mic and put pen to paper. Do what scares you. What would be your bucket list talent? What would you love to be naturally good at, without trying? Face down big challenges and find out what it takes to be good at them.


Start learning everything you can about different talents and skills to demystify the process. Shredding an electric guitar like Hendrix might look impossible, but if you don’t know a G chord from a flatpick, you don’t really have any clue how hard it is.
James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader and noted Shakespearean actor with a booming, godlike voice, suffered from terrible stuttering as a child. He was terrified of speaking in class and only learned to speak properly by facing his fear. Now, he’s widely recognized as one of the most talented voice actors in the world.

, What are other people tired of hearing you talk about? What do you have to drag yourself away from? Use the things you're obsessed with to discover abilities and talents that might be hiding under the surface.


Even if you’re obsessed with something that’s hard to connect to a talent, like watching television or movies, give yourself some credit. Maybe you have a talent for telling stories, or analyzing narratives. Maybe you have a talent for appreciating camera angles. Every film critic gets a start in the exact same way. Channel that obsession into learning about film history and learning how movies are made.

, If you're feeling talentless, maybe it's because you've been missing out on your own successes. Try to pay close attention to successes, both little and big, to identify things for which you might have a natural talent. Think creatively about how these little successes might connect to more significant talents and abilities.


Maybe you've just thrown a killer party. Might not sound like a talent, but if you've got the people skills, the planning, and the organization abilities necessary to pull it off, celebrate that as a success. Maybe you have leadership talents and managerial skills that will prove useful down the road.

, Shows like “American Idol” and ""Britain's Got Talent"" have very narrow definitions of what it means to be talented. If you’re not an attractive young person with a manufactured sob story and a loud, showy singing voice, these shows all lead people to believe they’re untalented. It’s not true. Being talented doesn’t mean being famous, being attractive, or being some kind of performer. It means dedication, creative thinking, and attention to detail. It means you have an insatiable curiosity to develop some innate abilities into skills. You've just got to find them.

, Personality quizzes are often used in job-finding offices to try to figure out what you might have a natural ability for. It works the same way with talent. Learning more about your natural proclivities for and against certain ideas, attitudes, and behaviors can help you figure out more about your talents. These sorts of tests do not identify talents in and of themselves, but they can lend insights that might provide part of the puzzle.


Myers-Briggs is possibly the most famous of the personality quizzes, separating people into one of sixteen types of personalities based on answers to a variety of questions and research performed by Carl Jung.The Keirsey Temperament Sorter separates people into various temperaments, identified by your responses to a variety of scenarios and questions. It's available online.

, One of the best ways to figure out what hidden talents you might have is to talk to the people who know you best. We tend to look over our skills and cover up our abilities, missing out too often on what makes us great. If you're lucky enough to have friends and family who care about you, they won't be so shy about pointing them out.

, One way to think about talent is to think about some preternatural ability to do something, to make this thing look easy. Another way to think about it is to think about talent as the ability to overcome some obstacle. Was Blind Willie Johnson a more talented guitar player for having been blinded? Was James Earl Jones a better actor for having stuttered? Was Michael Jordan a better ball player for having been cut from the team?


Don't let perceived shortcomings or challenges keep you from trying new things and developing talent. Look at things that someone else might have identified as challenges in your personality or your ability. If you're a shy person, might it be all the more impressive if you were a great rock 'n roller singer? If you're especially short, might you be a great ball player?

, Some people think Hendrix was the best guitar player of all time, but he couldn’t have played a classic piece on guitar to save his life, because he couldn’t read music. He might have been able to, if he put his mind to it, but a classical musician might well look on Hendrix as a talentless hack. Don’t let other people tell you that being an excellent Razor scooter rider isn’t a “real” talent, or that making a really good grilled cheese doesn’t count.

, Ryan Leaf was going to be the next big thing. A great football quarterback, finalist for the Heisman, second-overall pick in the NFL draft. Fast forward a few years, and Leaf is considered one of the biggest busts of all time, having failed to achieve at a high level. Natural talent for playing football doesn't mean anything if you don't commit to building it into a skill.


When you find your talent, think of it like a seed that you're planting. You're off to a good start, but you've still got to water it, mulch it, and weed around the edges to make sure your seed grows into a big plant. It takes work.

, As iron sharpens iron, so one talented person sharpens another. If you've got a talent for something, or even if you just hope to develop talent in some field, surround yourself with other talented people and model yourself after their behaviors, practice routines, and attitudes about their talent. Learn everything you can from talented people.



Find a mentor who's willing to show you the ropes and coach you in developing your new skills. Blossoming guitar players need good teachers beyond YouTube. Blossoming singers need other people to play music with.

, Developing your talent into a skill and your skill into an ability is going to be hard. The more you learn about a subject, a task, or an ability, the more complicated it becomes. Commit to learning everything you can about your field and challenging yourself to become a master. Turn your talent into something special. Make your talent real.


Playing chess might not get easier for Magnus Carlsen, just because he’s a phenomenal player. Now he knows just how complicated the game can be. The more you learn about a game, a skill, or a field, the more there will be to learn. It never gets easy.

, Even if you've got no talent for the guitar, practicing two hours a day guarantees that you'll get a lot better. Someone who practices, whether it be sport, art, or any other field, will always end up more talented than someone who never picks up their instrument, picks up their paintbrush, someone who never practices. Hard work outruns ability every time.

Have a background in or love for the entertainment industry.,
Identify the type of performer you wish to work for.,
Develop the skills and knowledge you need to be a talent manager.,
Intern with an established talent manager.,
Look for opportunities to take on more responsibility.,
Join a professional organization.",How to Become a Talent Manager," As with talent agents, many talent managers were once performers themselves or connected to the entertainment industry in some way, such as being an acting teacher, producer or theater critic. Still other talent managers were previously talent agents who decided to focus on building the careers of their most successful clients.;
, The part of the entertainment world that interests you most should be the area for which you have the greatest affinity. If music is your passion, you'll want to work with musicians; if you love the theater, you'll want to work with actors. If you have multiple interests, you may want to work with multi-talented performers.


You should also identify the kinds of personalities you are comfortable working with. While talent agents may represent a large number of clients on behalf of their agency, talent managers usually represent an individual or a group of individuals. In some respects, managing a performer is akin to being married to that performer.

, There is no formal coursework in how to be a talent manager, but you can learn many of the skills you need through formal study. College coursework in marketing, communications, public relations and human resources will make you a more capable talent manager, and studies in the fine arts will give you an understanding of the creative minds you'll be working with.


You can supplement your training with independent study. If you want to manage actors in film, it's helpful to have seen popular and enduring movies, such as those on the American Film Institute's Top 100 list. If you want to manage musicians, develop a working knowledge of the music business through reading industry publications such as ""Billboard."" You'll need this knowledge to pass it on to the talent you help develop.

, Get your foot in the door with a talent management firm or booking agency. If you can't find a talent manager to work with right away, you can also learn the business by working for producers, directors or casting directors. Regardless of where you start, observe as much as you can of how the business of managing talent works.


Depending on what kind of talent you choose to manage, you may want to move to one of the major cities that deal in such talent, such as New York City or Los Angeles for actors or Nashville for musicians. Even so, you can learn a great deal from talent managers in smaller cities before making the move.

, As you gain more experience, look for the chance to assist in evaluating scripts, planning tours or developing promotional packages. Eventually, you may be given complete charge over a client.

, Joining an organization such as the Talent Managers Association (TMA) gives you the chance to learn more about the business from your colleagues, as well as network for opportunities. The TMA maintains an online registry of its members, who are required to follow the association's code of ethics.

, Special skills can be anything from music to juggling to skateboarding to foreign languages to sports -- things that make you stand out to an agent or could be useful in a stage or commercial setting.

, There are lots of good professional agents, but unfortunately, this industry also has plenty of people who just want your money. Legitimate talent agents are paid if and when an actor gets work. If an agent asks for representation fees, or requires you to take specific classes or work with specific photographers, be very wary. Get the Call Sheet. Backstage publishes the Call Sheet, available in bookstores or online, which lists all the agencies in New York City and Los Angeles. Contact all the agencies that have a youth department.

, Agents want to see children who are relaxed, comfortable and confident. Answer questions with full sentences, not just a “yes” or “no”. Show that you are focused and can take direction well, and that you will be capable of maintaining that focus through a long day on the set. , It's very possible that you'll not be accepted by the first or second agent you see. Agents all have different ideas about what they want, and your ""look"" might not be what they're looking for. Keep interviewing and networking.

, It's great practice, and you will meet casting directors and other actors to build up your professional network.


Read Backstage, which lists open casting calls for children. Most are in the New York City area, but all areas are represented.Visit Casting Call Hub, which lists casting calls and auditions for children., Make sure you show up on time, well-rested, with plenty of extra resumes and headshots.


Know the product if it is a commercial audition. Casting agents may ask your opinion, and if you can respond knowledgeably and naturally, that will be a big plus.
Know the background and the characters if it is an audition for a play, TV show, or movie.

, Casting agents may ask you to perform. If you have participated in school or community productions, you may have some dialogue memorized. If not, some suggested monologues for kids are here., The casting agent may give you a few pages of script and a few minutes to prepare. Read through it as thoroughly as you can, decide what approach you will take, and go for it!

, In reality, there are lots of parts that most actors would consider to be ""small,"" and those are probably what you'll start out with. If you've got what they want -- and a whole lot of luck -- you'll be noticed and those parts will get bigger and bigger. Otherwise you may continue to be a bit player while you learn the industry.

Work out the pitch range of your voice - are you a soprano, alto, tenor or bass?,
Be on the lookout for a song that matches your voice type.,
Decide on the genre of the song you would like to sing.,
Choose what era of song you want.,
Look online for song options.,
Prepare yourself by memorizing the lines once the song is found.",How to Choose a Song to Sing at a Talent Show,"


A soprano's typical range is Middle C to G/A one octave above this (extremities extend to C if you are a highly pitched soprano) This means (for those not as familiar with these terms) you start on middle C and count 11/12 white keys above this on a piano. Note: Middle C is the closest C to the keyhole of the piano, or where you sit to play it.
An Alto's range is G (below Middle C) to C one octave above Middle C.
A Tenor's range is usually (with some variants) E below Middle C to G above Middle C.
A Bass' range is E one octave below (count down 12 white keys from middle C) Middle C to G below middle C

As unique as one person is from another in appearance, so to is your singing voice and this means you may be a sub-category of the voices listed above; for example a mezzo soprano will realistically only comfortably reach an E one octave above Middle C, yet have a stronger voice than an alto in its mid-range of E-(one octave above middle C)C.

;
, Once you know your type of voice, you now know what types of music will suit you. If you are looking for a well known song to sing it will usually come in several editions each written for different types of singers: (High voice, High Female voice, Low Female voice, High Male voice, Low Male voice etc)

, If you want to impress the judges with your classical talent, choosing a song from the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal School of Music) set Graded Pieces is a good way of showing your ability. These also categorize songs into vocal range so it is easier to see which will be suitable for you.

, If you want to impress the audience by pulling off a well-known song you could choose an old classic, or something really current. Knowing what type of audience to expect is a good thing to consider.

, Find a song that has this style and try to find related songs. (YouTube has good options)


Make sure the song fits your voice comfortably and you don't strain yourself!
Make sure the song will please your audience and yourself.
Get hold of the music - for the lowest possible cost! There are several websites which (once you know exactly what you want) sell music books and sheet music. Most sheet music (depending on the number of pages) for voice and piano will cost less than 2 pounds.

You should consider your strengths and weaknesses. Now is not the time to try something different. Make sure that the monologue that you select is relevant to the part that you are auditioning for.Select a monologue that shows off your diverse acting skills.
Select an age appropriate monologue. Avoid using something that you used several years ago.
Know your audition time limits. Select a monologue that fits well within those time limits so that you do not run out of time during your audition.
Avoid a monologue that includes excessive swearing, violence, or sex.;
, It is hard to stand out to the director if you are auditioning on something that they have seen performed several times. They will compare your performance to the performances that they have seen before. In this case, blending in is not a good thing.Avoid common Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet.

, Your resume will inform the director of any other skills that you have such as gymnastics, singing, or dancing. Stick to something that you know you are good at. Highlight the skills that you most often receive compliments.Make sure that your monologue actual requires acting instead of just telling a story.
Your monologue should show the director why your are unique.

, Begin rehearsing your monologue by breaking it up into smaller pieces. Monologues are often overwhelming because they are not naturally broken up with lines from different actors. Break up the monologue by paragraphs or natural changes in the character’s emotions. Think about the staging, gestures, and tonalities that need to occur within each section., Work on memorizing the monologue quickly. The faster you memorize the material, the more you will get to rehearse and perfect the monologue off book. This will give you more confidence walking into the audition.Try memorizing the material by writing or typing it out. This will help you commit it to memory.
Record yourself speaking the monologue and listen to it while you are doing other things, such as cooking or driving.
Make use of rehearsal apps, such as Rehearsal 2, to rehearse the monologue. This app helps you memorize your lines and develop your character.

, Once you feel more confident with your monologue, you should perform it in front of friends or family. Request them to give you feedback at the end of your monologue to help improve it. Try to mimic the audition as much as possible so that you feel comfortable and prepared the day of the audition.

, Don’t wait until you are onstage to get into character. Consider getting into character as soon as you wake up that morning. Turning your character “on” right before stepping on stage can be difficult. Consider your character’s emotions and lifestyle.

, It is completely normal to be nervous before your audition. Take a few minutes before your audition to try to relax. Take several deep breaths. Breathe deeply through your nose and fill your lungs with air. Release that air through your mouth slowly., Don’t walk on stage questioning yourself or your ability to perform your monologue well. Walk onstage with your head held high and introduce yourself to the people that you are auditioning for. If you have the chance to shake their hands, do so firmly.Being overly confident can come off as cocky or conceited. Remember to stay humble as well.

, Making eye contact with your audience can make them feel uncomfortable, especially in an audition. Instead of looking people in the eye, aim to look just above their heads. This will look and feel normal to the audience.

, Most people do not overuse gestures when they talk. Therefore, you should generally not overuse gestures when you act. You can also have a very moving monologue by simply being still.There are monologues that may require more grandiose gestures.

, It is normal to fly through your monologue when you are nervous during an audition. Be sure to speak slowly and clearly. Speaking too quickly will make it difficult for the audience to understand what you are saying., During most auditions you will receive feedback and then get a chance to perform your monologue again. Do not be so married to the rehearsed version of your monologue that you cannot apply the direction and feedback that was given to you. The director wants to know that you are flexible and open to feedback."

Steve McGarrett is a Navy Seal. His father, ex-cop Jack McGarrett, was killed in the first episode of the series. The state's governor asked Steve to build and run a task force with her powers to eliminate convicts.
Danny Williams is recruited from the mainland by the Honolulu Police to investigate Steve's father's death. His nickname is 'Danno', which, as revealed in the first episode, came from his daughter.
Chin Ho Kelly was trained in the Honolulu Police by Steve's father. He was accused by the police of taking payoffs and was released by the department. He is recruited to the task force by Steve.
Kona (Kono) Kalakaua is Chin Ho's cousin. Coming from the police academy, she is also a surfer. In the original series, Kono was a male figure, while in the modern series, it is now a girl.;
, Because the original theme song was very known and respected, the producers kept it the same and raised it with a modernized beat. The opening credits still show shots of Hawaii, along with showing the characters in a 'technology' aspect.

, The former Honolulu Advertiser building, located on Kapiolani Blvd, is used as the soundstage for the show. Shot locations throughout the island include North Shore, Kaneohe, Waikiki, Halawa, Pearl Harbor, and metro Honolulu. They have also used the Hilton Hawaiian Village in a suspect chase and the baggage claim of Honolulu International Airport.

The University of Hawaii (UH) and the University of Southern California (USC) were both asked by CBS to participate in a ""battle of the bands"" to recreate the theme song in their own style. Both schools were taped and shown in two separate advertisements for promoting the show.
Between mid-September and early October 2010, 18 colleges and universities participated in a national ""Marching Band Mania"". Similar to the UH/USC battle, the winner of this contest would receive $25,000 and featured in a Hawaii Five-0 episode.

Know what you're good at.,
Consider what you want to win.,
Consider your personal reasons, as well.",How to Appear on a Game Show1," Game shows are based around one or more types of skills. Game shows like ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" and ""Jeopardy!"" require the ability to recall facts, while ""Wheel of Fortune"" tests the ability to solve word puzzles. ""Minute to Win It"" and ""Wipe out"" each require physical skill, while ""The Price is Right"" requires a knowledge of prices. ""Family Feud"" requires an understanding of how people think in responding to survey questions, while ""Let's Make a Deal"" sometimes requires the skills of the other game shows, along with the ability to know when to trade and when not to trade for something else. Dating shows require a certain amount of physical attractiveness and an outgoing personality.


Look at the games you enjoy playing. If you're good at Trivial Pursuit, you probably would be best suited for a game show that tests your trivia skills, such as ""Jeopardy!"" If you enjoy word games like Scrabble, you may be best suited for game shows like ""Wheel of Fortune"" or ""Lingo.""
Look at your other hobbies. If you're a good athlete and relatively fearless, you'd probably prefer a physical game show such as ""Wipe out"" or ""Minute to Win It."" If you enjoy karaoke, you'd probably enjoy being a contestant on either ""Don't Forget the Lyrics"" or ""The Singing Bee."";
, Game shows offer either material prizes supplied by companies in exchange for their being advertised on the show, or cash, which comes from fees paid by advertisers to have their products endorsed, or a combination of both.


Prizes are chosen mostly for their perceived television appeal as opposed to their usefulness to the contestant. In most cases, they are connected to a game, either thematically, such as the prize in the Prize Puzzle on ""Wheel of Fortune"" relating to the puzzle's theme, or to a point in the show's schedule, such as the prizes in the on-stage pricing games on ""The Price is Right."" If you can use most of the prizes the show offers, such as a new car or trip, you may be content to appear on a game show that features material prizes. If not, you should probably try out for a show where cash is the main prize.
In the United States, game show contestants must pay taxes on any prizes they win. If paying the tax on a high-value prize would be a financial hardship, you would probably be better off trying out for a show where cash is the predominant prize. (Contestants from other countries who appear on U.S. game shows may be exempt from such taxes, according to the rules of their native country.)

, Despite the advice above, you may find another, more pertinent reason for choosing to appear on a game show that's more important to you. If you've been a lifelong fan of the host, appearing on the show, or at least being in the studio audience, would give you an opportunity to meet that person. If you just want to show off, a game show that's relatively easy to get on may be your best bet; an avid costumer might enjoy appearing on ""Let's Make a Deal.""

Familiarize yourself with the show.,
Meet the eligibility requirements.,
Contact the game show or network it appears on.,
Audition.",How to Appear on a Game Show2," It helps to have a working knowledge of how the game plays before you try to become a contestant. Some game shows have developed strategies that can help contestants, such as the clues contained within the answers on ""Jeopardy!"" or the vocal inflections for synonyms and antonyms that were part of giving clues on ""Password"" during its run.


Some game shows yet to be broadcast put out calls for contestants. In such cases, it's impossible to have a working knowledge of the show before applying to be a contestant.

, All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year. (Some shows have more stringent requirements, such as a minimum age of 21 or not accepting contestants who've appeared on 2 shows in the last 5 years or 3 in the last 10.) You are also not allowed to be affiliated in any way with the game show's production company, the network or syndicator that distributes it, any of the stations that carry it, or its sponsors or advertisers.


You can appear on a game show if you belong to an actors' union such as the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) or the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), provided your primary income at the time of your appearance comes from work other than acting.
Affiliations that can prevent you from appear on a game show include having been an employee of any of the organizations connected with it, being related to an employee, or knowing an employee.

, Most game shows include a broadcast segment featuring instructions on how to apply to be a contestant. For network game shows such as ""The Price is Right"" and ""Let's Make a Deal,"" which choose their contestants from their studio audiences, this means asking for tickets to attend a taping. For most other game shows, it usually means contacting the show through its website or the website of the network that carries it, although some shows also offer telephone numbers and mailing addresses as alternatives.


Some game shows need only your name, address, age, and other information to identify you as meeting its eligibility requirements. Other shows may also ask for a photograph or short video, along with a short biography. (""Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?"" wants photos of the contestants as they appeared in the upper elementary grades, as the contestant's childhood photo is displayed after the contestant comes on stage.)

, Most game shows have an audition/interview process to identify potential contestants who fit the show's profile and weed out those who don't. For game shows that choose their contestants from the studio audience, this takes the form of interviewing each member of the studio audience before taping. For other game shows, contestants may be given a test of general knowledge and their ability to play the game in addition to the interview; these auditions usually occur well before the taping and may be held in locations other than those where the show is taped.


If you pass your audition, you will have a chance to appear as a contestant. The time from your audition to your appearance may be anywhere from a few weeks to a year and a half, depending on the show's popularity and the number of people who qualify. If you don't get to appear after the period of time indicated by the show's producers, you can apply again.

"
Follow the directions.,
Be honest.,
Fill out the form completely.,
Send in photos if required.,
Have patience.,
Be prepared for a long wait.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be prepared to share your story.,
Demonstrate high energy.",How to Apply for Deal or No Deal," Not following the directions is a good way to get yourself eliminated from consideration pretty quickly. Make sure to read over the application carefully before you start to fill it out. For example, a hard-copy application may ask you to use a pen with blue or black ink. Likewise, you may be asked to submit additional information online in a certain format.;
, Like other reality programs and game shows, Deal or No Deal is looking for genuine participants. Don't exaggerateyour accomplishments or fabricate a life history. Instead, focus on your real accomplishments and look at how you can present them in an engaging way.


Ask a good friend who knows you well to help you pull out awesome details from your life.

, As with failing to follow the directions, incomplete forms are another insta-kill for your chances at getting on the show. If you don't know how to answer a certain question, get help from a friend. Examples of strange questions you may have to answer include:


What is your weirdest quality?
Draw a picture of yourself.

, Get at least one headshot and a full body shot. If you take your own pictures, stand in front of a light or neutral background. This eliminates unnecessary distractions from the main focus of the picture: you.

, It may be months before you hear any news on your application. Deal of No Deal, like other shows, casts months in advance of its shooting schedule. You have no way of knowing where in the cycle the show is at the time of your application.

, Major televisions shows, such as Deal of No deal, hold auditions for hundreds of candidates at a time. It will be an all-day event, so prepare yourself accordingly. Make sure that you bring plenty of water and snacks with you. Also, you will probably have to wait outside for a while, so bring a jacket if the weather is cool or an umbrella to shield yourself from the sun if it is hot.

, Wear something flattering but not overly revealing. If you have a great figure, show it off in a form-fitting outfit. This goes for women and men, too. Don't wear anything with a logo on it, however, as the producers will have to blur it out.

, Deal or No Deal is interested in people with stories that people can relate to, and to people who are relatablein general. Talk about yourself, what you've done, your hopes, and your dreams. Speak about obstacles you've encountered and how you overcame them. Don't be afraid to tell the producers about your deepest, most secret fear. Don't just dryly present these as facts, show your personality. Don't be afraid to let your emotions show. Some extra tidbits to keep in mind are:


If you have a tragedy in your life, such as losing a family member or overcoming a serious illness, by all means, tell the story to the producers. They love these kinds of stories as they're great for narrative building.
Producers also appreciate quirkiness. If there is something about you that is just a little bit off, let it show. Uniqueness matters.

, Enthusiasm counts for shows like Deal of No Deal. While you're waiting, make sure that you keep your energy high. For example, do something that gets your heart pumping, such as jumping-jacks. You can also listen to your favorite dance tune while bopping your head, or better yet, dancing to it.

Protest on paper.,
Join forces.,
Tell Everybody.,
Campaign.,
Sign a petition.,
Use the media.,
Get a gimmick.",How to Take Action to Get a Canceled TV Show Back on the Air," Write to the network but leave the drama to the soap operas. Writing something like ""I will just die if I never see this show again"" is a bit dramatic and a good way to get your letter dismissed as the rantings of a deranged viewer. You also don't want to make threats, like ""If you don't put X back on the air, I'll never watch your network again!"" You want your letter to be read by a network executive, so be brief, be real. Write an anecdote about how the show has become part of your life. The execs are TV fans too. They'll understand, and you'll make your point.;
, You can't be the only person upset about the cancellation of your beloved show. Find allies on the internet. Type in ""save"" and the name of the show into a search engine. There may already be a website dedicated to your cause.

, Talk about the show, at work, with your friends, at a cafe,anywhere. Excitement is contagious, especially on the internet, and it can show the network there's a lot more interest in the show than they thought. The more people you get to support your cause the more likely the network is to respond.

, You'll need to campaign for your show in order to recruit new fans to support your cause. A few ways to do that include:


Giving out your DVDs of the show
Putting a sign on a billboard
Using the show's logo as your instant message icon or as a signature in your e-mails
Reminding your friends about upcoming episodes
Doing anything to expand the fan base.

, Defenders of endangered shows usually have an online petition. It's the same thing as a written petition but is located online. Make sure you sign it and get all your friends to do the same. The more signatures, the more the petition will get noticed.

, Your best bet is probably the news department of the station that carries the show. They have a built-in reason to support the show. And there's a bonus. If they do a story on your save-the-show cause it could be picked up by other affiliates or the network itself. So send an email or give them a call and let them know all the effort you and fellow fans are putting in to get this show back on the air.

, Go crazy. Networks notice nuts. Seriously, fans of the show ""Jericho"" sent 40,000 pounds of nuts to CBS and their show got picked up again. So go over the top. Only dedication can stop cancellation. Think of something that represents the show and once again shows what a true fan you are.

Compare.",How to Tell if You're Watching TV in HD," HDTV signals can only be displayed on an HD monitor or an HDTV (and modern computer monitors). A high definition television set (or ""HDTV"") consists of a monitor or display and a built-in ATSC (digital) tuner (the old and now obsolete NTSC tuners were for standard definition analog signals only). A monitor differs from a TV as it lacks a tuner. An HD monitor or HDTV is capable of at least 720 lines of resolution but many are capable of 1080 lines of resolution. An SDTV however, can only display 480 lines of resolution. The lines of resolution are further characterized as being scanned in either a progressive or interlaced manner (more on this later). The possible display types (in North America) are as follows: 480i, 480P, 720P, 1080i and 1080P. 480i displays are SD or Standard Definition; 480P were sometimes called ED or Enhanced Definition and the rest are HD or High Definition.

This chart compares the differences between common display resolutions sold mostly in the US and Canada. The values from top right to bottom right are the display's vertical resolution values. The values across the top are also resolution, but determine the display's horizontal resolution and are those that are often cited when advertised. The ""PAL"" box distinguishes the SDTV format that is used mostly in Europe and a few other places. The smaller, NTSC box is the original SDTV size used in the U.S. and represents the 4:3 or standard ratio. The rest of the boxes (except of course PAL) all represent a 16:9 or wide screen ratio, regardless if 720P or 1080P or 1080i.;
, The i after 480 and 1080 represents the older interlaced scanning method while the P after 480, 720 and 1080 represents a newer, more desirable progressive scanning method. The term interlace describes how the image is ""painted"" or scanned on the display. U.S. displays have either 480, 720 or 1080 horizontal lines. An interlaced display will paint the odd numbered lines (1, 3, 5, 7, etc.) first starting at the top left corner of the display - continuing to the bottom right. When complete, it will repeat the process for the even numbered lines (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.), and continue until the display is shut off. Progressive scanning is a method that paints all lines in a sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) order. Most people prefer the progressive scan display as it generally looks better than an interlaced display (click the image to the right for an example). 480 and 1080 displays can be either or both interlaced or progressive while 720 is only progressive.
, An HD monitor (and most HDTVs) will have a selection of input jacks consisting of one or more of the following:


HDMI - High Definition Multimedia Interface - a single connector cable that can deliver both stereo or surround sound and HD video.







DVI - Digital Visual Interface - a multi-pin / single connector & cable that delivers HD video only.







VGA - Video Graphic Adapter - multi-pin / single connector & cable used to connect computer video cards to monitors. If this jack is found on the monitor or HDTV, it can be used to display the computer graphics on the monitor or TV instead of a dedicated computer monitor. This is useful in a home theater computer setup if the installed video card lacks an HDMI port.







Component - Red Green Blue - an assembly of 3 color coded cables that delivers HD video only signals via three individual analog connectors. Both the DVI and component video cables will require additional cable(s) to bring audio signals to an amplifier and speakers (or directly to the red and white ""L"" and ""R"" stereo audio input jacks of the HDTV).






""S Video"" - A cable that provides a superior signal than the yellow composite type shown below, but can not deliver HD signals. It provides video only.







Composite video and stereo audio - Like the S Video cable above, it can not provide HD video signals. Often times, it is bundled as a cable assembly including L (left) and R (right) audio signals. It too, has color coded connectors like the component video cable above. Left and right stereo audio is sent via cables with red and white or red and black connectors. The video signal is almost always via cable with yellow connectors.







, Since a monitor will only display the signals that are delivered to it, a stand alone ATSC type tuner and a standard UHF / VHF antenna system will be required to watch broadcasters. An HDTV already has a tuner built-in, so a stand alone tuner is not required unless it was equipped with only a legacy NTSC tuner. The older HDTVs may have either one or both the state-of-the-art ATSC or now obsolete NTSC tuner, while new HDTVs have the desired ATSC tuner only. NTSC tuners have been rendered obsolete for OTA (Over the Air broadcast) since June 2009 when the FCC moved broadcasters to digital transmitters, but can still be useful for receiving basic cable stations in standard definition (480i) or receiving signals from the modulated output of a satellite or cable tuner box or VCR. Like the monitor and ATSC tuner combination, the HDTV will also require a standard UHF/VHF antenna system.


Use of a cable TV or satellite TV provider will replace the need for an ATSC tuner and UHF / VHF antenna system. These providers however, will supply premium HD tuners in order to watch HD images. The standard offering of equipment from these providers is generally SDTV (standard definition TV) and is not capable of providing an HD image to view.






Check video players. In 2008, a battle between developers of two competing video formats (not unlike the one between ""BetaMax"" and ""VHS"" video tape technologies decades before); the HD-DVD and Blu-ray Disc was settled, with ""Blu-ray Disc"" becoming the accepted standard. Both formats are capable of delivering HD images, but the production of both HD-DVD players and the transfer of new movies for rental or purchase on this media has ceased. It is important to note that both the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray format provided backward compatibility to the older DVD standard. As such, both can playback standard DVDs. Unfortunately, neither the older ""DVD"" or ""VHS"" tape formats will be able to store or deliver HD video. Lastly, a lesser known format, S-VHS (""Super"" VHS, not to be confused with the video signal format S-Video) provided better resolution than VHS but was still less than HD, and was not very popular.







, Having all the right equipment will not allow for HD image display if using the lower resolution inputs and associated cables. Use either the HDMI, DVI, VGA or RGB jacks and cables to connect devices. This will ensure that high definition signals are presented to the HDTV or monitor for display. The yellow composite ""video in"" jack should NOT be used if an HD signal input on the TV and output on a source or player are available. Never connect two devices to the same input group of the HDTV (""Input 1"" should only have one device connected, ""Input 2"" should have a different device, etc.)
, Using the HDTV manual and device (Blue-Ray, Satellite Tuner, etc.) manual(s) as a guide, select an input. Review the highest supported resolution that is common to the device and HDTV. If the HDTV is capable of up to 720P, no input greater than 720P should be selected. Likewise, for 1080i or 1080P sources. Many HDTVs will ""downrez"" to the maximum supported by the HDTV, but it will need to process the signal to do so and result in some signal degradation. The objective is to not limit the resolution of the device's output to less than 480P (progressive scan for some DVD players), 720P or 1080i (for many CATV, satellite, HD-DVD players, etc.) or 1080P (all Blu-Ray Disc players and some satellite receivers), unless that value exceeds the display maximum resolution input.

, After tuning different channels or selecting SD sources, it should be readily apparent to the viewer which signal type is which. Live studio broadcasts and sporting events in HD are excellent sources to compare to those that may not be initially obvious. Beard stubble on men, individual blades of grass in golf or baseball, and other images that appear to be 3 dimensional or photo quality are typical examples of HD images. SD images by comparison could be described as ""soft"" or fuzzy looking - as if a thin coating of petroleum jelly was on the screen.

Look for casting calls and auditions.,

Be practical.,
Know why you want to do this.",How to Get on a Reality TV Show," Being on a reality TV show is about being exposed. And that exposure is to everyone, including your family, friends, neighbors, former school teachers, the boss, your priest, and your old flame. Is this something you can handle? Do you mind if people who used to know you talk about you? (They will, and it won't always be flattering.) If you're not worried about the real likelihood that your laundry will be aired, your worst moments shown in detailed focus, and your inability to do something a monkey could do made into highlight of the week, then you're ready! On the other hand, if you value your privacy and reputation intensely, reality TV stardom may not be for you; give it up before the going gets tough if that's the case!;
, It's not reality for starters - it's a house, an island, a boardroom, a viper-infested pit, etc., that has been specifically set up for filming 24/7. On top of that, much of it will be scripted, so the ""real you"" may not be quite so ""real"".On most reality TV shows, you'll be expected to live in these fishbowls with very few private moments, with no respite from those you're sharing space with, and with relationship challenges thrown your way daily, relentlessly. And then there are the actual challenges you're expected to perform for the show. Think about the following questions very carefully:


If you're trying for a reality TV show that requires you to ""live it rough"", is that something your manicured nails and regularly gelled hair-do could handle? Are you all right living with no mattress, or on rationed food?
If you're on a show that requires you to take dares or to eat local cuisine, are you able to eat bugs, unusual foods, unidentifiable somethings, or do your vegan or finicky food ways preclude you from sharing in what might be the only protein available that day, or that might win you the challenge?!
Can you bear to have to pit your wits against that Harvard graduate every five minutes?
Will it bother you to be locked out of a cozy huddle because you're considered to be an outsider at some stage as the game plan in the show unfolds?
Can you stand to put your hand into that bee-infested box? (Or are you so allergic to insects that going on a daring challenge show is plain out of the question?)
Are you willing to give up your day job or take extended unpaid leave if your employer isn't in agreement with you about having time off work to ""play TV games""?, For a brand new show, read whatever is already available in the media about the show's intended themes, content, time slot, and audience. For an existing show, it makes good sense to be up-to-date about the entire show from its previous seasons. This is probably easier if you've watched it without fail since it began. Even with fan knowledge though, you need to take a look at an existing show with brand new eyes and see things that will impact you if you do get a part on the show. Look for such things such as:


How are contestants judged? Who are the likely judges? Would you be able to impress them or simply feel awkward before them?
Learn from past successes and failures on the relevant show. Do you think you have the same skills, cunning, daring, or whatever else it takes to avoid the pitfalls and reach success?
Is nudity expected at any stage?
Do you have to eat things that are simply awful and that you'd never think of eating in a million years?
Will you be forced to be around people you know you will find difficult to get along with?
Will you have to stretch your physical abilities to their limits, and are you in good enough shape? Your mental health is as important as your physical health too, so think about your health as a whole and the sorts of things that might challenge it on the show.

, There are several ways to do this:


Look on your favorite reality TV shows own website. Usually if they are calling for new participants/contestants, the call will be placed on the webpage with further details well in advance of an upcoming season. Keep a watch on the relevant site.
Call the TV station and ask for advice. They may be able to take down your details and alert you to upcoming opportunities.
Look on a site that collates reality TV show casting calls and auditions. Some examples of sites to check in the U.S. are under ""Sources and Citations"" below.

, The details matter and if you don't abide by the rules in the application form, it may well be thrown away without a second glance, given that so many hopefuls will be trying their luck.If the form asks for a photo, provide one, if it asks for a photo in a certain way, meet that request. If you have to include a video, a portfolio, a reference, etc., do as requested, as this will all increase your prospects of getting to the next stage. If it feels unaffordable or a waste of time, then you're already counting yourself out, so don't proceed.

, Whether you are auditioning, or providing a pitch with your application, to catch the eye of those casting, you will need to have something that the reality TV show wants. It may well be that you can't discern this because you don't know what dynamics they are wanting to script into the show (although watching past shows should give you some idea), or whether someone similar to you has already come to their notice and they don't need another person so alike. There are things you can do to improve your chances, however, such as:


Proving your own ""wow factor"" (appearance, a talent, a stunt, etc.), or approaching the audition or pitch with a unique angle. Think about making use of such tools as YouTube (start a campaign!), a portfolio of your talents outside of the usual humdrum work routine, or zany photos of yourself. Think outside the square, relate it to the TV show in question, and give it your all if you go down the path of trying to impress those selecting the cast in a unique way.
Beware of resorting to gimmicks though, as these rarely ingratiate you with those judging your performance. Find the fine balance between interestingly unique and just plain trying-too-hard, or bizarre. Realize that anything that distracts from you will do precisely that and should be left out of your application or performance routine; less is often more.
Remember also that they may just be looking for the normal, usual you with all your foibles, talents, and ""uninteresting"" bits rolled into one because they can see something in you that matches their hoped-for scenario and to be frank, it's the weaknesses in personality that attract viewing. The demographic also matters considerably, as the full cast selection must be appealing to a wide variety of viewers., When self-assessing your suitability to go any further, some of the things that you should keep in mind include a good dose of realism. There is no point auditioning for a show that wants the complete opposite of you - they are just not going to be sold over to your way of seeing things. As such, other things to keep in mind include:


Are you the right height, weight, size, look, etc., for whatever the show focuses on? It makes little sense to apply to be in a weight loss show when you're already at an ideal weight, or to try modeling when your height isn't what they're looking for. It's pointless offering to sleep rough for a month when you're terrified of being seen naked by fellow contestants or sharing your sleeping quarters with spiders.
Can you actually sing, dance, act, etc., as required?
Do you have the qualifications or smarts needed? If you're applying for a show wanting people with a business background or a college education and you don't have one, again, it may not be worth your while.

, It may sound trite, especially after going through all the steps above, but the shows producers will want a strong, well-founded response and not just one based merely on your wish to never work in a cocktail bar again. Formulate an answer that demonstrates your strengths, your interesting points, and a desire to be a good role model. Telling them ""I want to be famous"" rarely distinguishes you from every other person wanting the same. Be confident in what you believe you can contribute to the show as well as focusing on your hoped-for outcome.

Watch the reruns/read through the book and find key points which indicate their reasons for turning to 'the dark side of the force' (yes, Anakin Skywalker, we're talking about you). Try to see the whole thing from their perspective, not yours!;
, The more you see it, the easier it is to accept: they're the bad guy, and there's nothing you can do about it.

, This particular character has had his ups and downs in life. Observe times when he didn't realize that he was bad.

, This helps in any case. If they repent at the last moment, it makes everything a little better. NOTE: this step is optional.

, There's good and there's bad, this character just did what he believed was right. Everybody has their own personal beliefs. It's easiest just to accept it.

, Oh, the irony! It will be simply smashing to see how the other characters react to this sudden betrayal. Savour this part, trust me, this is always an exciting part of a story.

, The other characters, unless they are extremely emotional, will accept their betrayal and get on with their lives. After all, none of us can linger on the past. Follow their example.

Start small.,
Don't replace old shows with new ones.,
Use the TV timer.,
Keep a TV diary.,
Compare your TV time to the time you need to reach your unachieved goals.,
Get rid of and hide TVs.,
Cut down on channels.,
Use recording devices to your advantage.",How to Quit Watching TV1," Try not watching TV for just one day a week. Make sure to replace that time with another activity that's equally or more satisfying. In other words, don't replace TV time with a task you dread. The task might be noble (such as cleaning the fireplace, or raking leaves, or giving the cat a bath) but such endeavors are best left to when you've already phased TV out of your life. Right now, the best way to wean yourself off of TV is to replace it with another enjoyable activity, but one that's more constructive or engaging, like reading a book, practicing to be a guitar god, or playing drown the penny with your kids. Eventually, increase the number of days per week when you don't watch TV, until there are none (if you wish to go that far).

, When one of your favorite shows goes off the air or you stop enjoying it, don't replace it with another show. Instead, use that new free time to do something else, like calling on friends, doing a hobby, reading, or exercise. Eventually, you will whittle down the shows you watch to a manageable few.

, Many TVs come with a timer feature. When you start watching TV, decide how much time you want to spend there, and set the timer so that the TV turns off when that time is up. This prevents you from ""lingering"" on the TV, or at least it's a reminder, forcing you to turn the TV back on if you want to keep watching. If you have an older television that does not have a timer, or if you do not know how to use your TV timer, get a simple egg timer from the store. They are cheap, easy to use, and handy for other uses in the house.

, Bringing attention to your habit, without pressuring yourself to get rid of it, can help you realize how much time you actually waste on TV. In fact, the very act of recording how much time you spend watching TV (and what you watch) is likely to reduce your habit. As you write down ""12:30am - Watching rerun of Friends that I've seen twice already"" you might realize how much of a waste of time it is, and shut off the television, whereas normally you would just keep watching because you lose track of time.

, This is a good motivation exercise. Once you've kept a TV diary for at least a week, you'll know how much time television really takes up in your life. Now it's time to ask yourself how you can use that time more productively. If you're spending 20 hours a week glued to the tube, think about how much you could accomplish if you redirected that time towards something else! Make a list of goals, or things you always complain about but never have time to do. Things like:

Losing weight and getting fit.
Spending more quality time with friends, your significant other, or your family.






Learning or practicing a musical instrument.






Planting a garden so you can grow your own food.







, The rise in television is linked to the increase in TVs per household.Cut down on the number of TVs, and you'll cut down on TV time. You might be met with a good deal of resistance if you live with other people who are addicted to TV, especially kids--see How to Get Your Children Away from TV--but do you really need more than one TV? Do you really need one at all? If you do leave a TV in the house, at least put it in an uncomfortable place, like the garage, with no comfy couch to lounge in.

, Another reason people are watching more TV is because there are more channels.Look into downgrading your cable or satellite package (and you'll save some money, too!). Another option, if your provider offers it, is to program your TV so it only shows channels that don't suck you in--or if they do suck you in, they at least feed your brain. Stick to news, science, and history channels. Steer clear of entertainment, comedy, and sports channels. Make it so that you can't access the ""bad"" channels unless you have a password, and have someone you trust be the only person who knows the password. Having to ask for permission is a good way to filter your TV watching.

, Even though recording devices like DVR and TiVo are associated with an increase in TV watchingyou can also use them for the opposite effect. Make a rule that you will only watch recorded shows. Then place a limit on how much TV you can record. This will force you to be more selective about what you watch.

Decide what you would like to do for a period of time other than watch TV.,
Pick a time span that you plan to do what you picked for step #1.,
Turn off and unplug the television for the time specified in step 2.

,
Keep doing this until you no longer miss the time away from the television.",How to Quit Watching TV2," This is a critical step because if you do not find something that will keep your interest, you will fall back on your ol' faithful crutch, the TV. Look up a volunteer program, 'check out' that book, books of CD or magazine out of the library, find a new hobby, pick a craft, introduce your self to your family or even your neighbors, or any thing else that you want to do that you are currently not doing. You may want to schedule something during your usual TV-watching time; you cannot watch TV at your house and volunteer at the local soup kitchen at the same time.;
, Start with a small amount of time, (30 minutes, 1 hour) and then expand each day or week.

,, Then increase the time. Soon enough your TV time will be replaced with something productive. You may even get to the point where watching TV is a waste of your time and your money. Also, you can cut you expenses down by down grading your cable or satellite package.

Keep in mind that young children cannot consistently understand the difference between reality and make-believe.,
Don't over-discuss violence with very young children.,
Offer an alternative; don't make censoring the program a punishment.",How to Explain Violence in Cartoons to Kids1," Up until about age seven or so, children understand the world in a very concrete, literal way. Young children aren't stupid; they just understand the world differently than adolescents or adults. Remember, children commonly hold beliefs such as:


Cartoon characters somehow ""live"" inside a TV or DVD or computer.
Animals such as dogs and cats can talk, even though a child has a pet at home that has never, ever talked.
If you have a cape, you can fly. All you need is to find or make a suitable cape.


Children will act out on violent acts. They will also act out what they see even if the actions are punished on-screen. Numerous scientific studies show that a child will do this. They see something on-screen, for better or worse, they will act on the behavior they see.






Young children also do not fully understand cause and effect. For instance, they might not understand punching a person causes real, physical pain in the other person.





;
, You don't have to go into elaborate reasons why watching characters karate-kick each other is bad for him or her.


Change the channel or turn off the TV or other media.
Simply state matter-of-fact:

""I don't like what those (people/robots/creatures/etc.) are doing to each other.""
""This show is not appropriate for you.""
""I don't want you to think hitting/kicking/teasing/etc. is OK, because it's not.""



, Do NOT, however, give in to whining, begging, pestering, or the like to put the show back on.

Watch TV with your kids, and discuss physical violence that your child has seen in cartoons, TV shows or movies.,
Learn about TV and ""Movie Magic"".,
Talk about how to deal with situations appropriately.",How to Explain Violence in Cartoons to Kids2," Don't lecture...start a dialogue. Critical thinking helps children develop skepticism when it comes to violence. Here's some questions you might ask:


That's interesting. If someone chased me with a frying pan, I'd call the police. What would you do?
These people seem to solve their problems with martial arts. Is that something you see at school?
Do you think falling off a cliff would hurt you? Why doesn't it for the Coyote?

, Understanding how media is not reality helps children realize it's make-believe.

Make a flip-book. Cartoons are based on this technological effect, not little people in a TV. It is also an excellent art and science project!
Visit a TV studio. Many communities have a local TV studio, such as a community cable studio, high school or college TV station. Seeing the equipment, people, and techniques that go into making a TV show helps build understanding.

, It is very easy to use aggression as a way of getting what you want but that it is something every person, including yourself, has to learn to overcome. It is very, very rare that one has to resort to physical violence to solve a situation.

Verbal violence is also not acceptable, including bullying language or concepts. This also means put-downs, name-calling, threats and so on. While more subtle, these are surprisingly common in cartoons.

, A great show ending doesn't feel great, but the empty feeling can be alleviated by sharing your thoughts with others. Make a post outlining your opinions on the show wrap-up. Online posts can spark an engaging conversation about what you just saw. Sharing the loss with other people will make it feel better.

, If only so you have people to geek out over your favourite parts with, fellow fans are a great way to intensify your appreciation for parts of a show. A show's first-run comes with the social aspect of being able to discuss it the morning after an episode airs. The same should be true when the show ends.

, If you can't bear the thought of your favorite show ending, why not continue writing the show yourself? Pick up where the characters were in the final episode and start their story anew from there. If you're really passionate and knowledgeable about the show, you should have at least some idea of where the characters would go next.


If a show's fandom is big enough, it's quite likely that other writers have penned their own fanfictions about the show already. Go to sites like FanFiction and read some work about your favorite characters.Remember to give credit to the creator of a TV show or the author of a book.

, Sit around and discuss your favorite parts of the show. If footage is available, watch some of your favourite clips. Get into friendly debates over aspects of the series finale. A bit of friendly argument is a great way to get your mind off the loss.


If you want to get theatrical with your farewell, you can hold a mock funeral for the show and its characters.You can go around in a circle and reflect on your favourite characters and scenes.

, If a network cancelled a show and realizes there is significant following they've alienated, they may be convinced to bring the show back on air. Find out whoever cancelled or ended the show, and send a letter expressing your love for the show. If it was cancelled, make sure to emphasize that you would like to see the show returned to television. If a network gets enough feedback for one show, it almost certainly has an effect on whether they decide to bring it back or not.


Don't get your hopes up about a revival. Shows like Firefly received a zealous backlash when they were cancelled, but never got the TV revival fans were looking for.

, After some time, all of the seasons of your favourite show will be available for home purchase. The most conventional way of this is to buy the DVD box sets. Having a concrete copy of your favourite show at home is great if you watch the show a lot and don't want to rely on a channel for it. Streaming services like Netflix also showcase entire shows. This makes streaming services perfectly suited for the ""binge watching"" that usually comes with watching a great show.


Check online to see if your show is available as a free download. Some of the channel's websites will feature old episodes so people can catch up on their own time.

, You can watch a few episodes per night, or marathon entire seasons in a day if you want. As always, the most enjoyable way to do this is to do it in pairs or as a group. Watching a whole show together requires some common scheduling, but it will feel a lot less lonely.

, Special features show the behind-the-scenes stuff in a TV show. Things like interviews, on-set documentaries and marketing spots all help to enrich your knowledge and appreciation of the show. If you look at everything that went into the making of a particular scene, you'll almost certainly have a greater appreciation for it the next time you put it on.

, If you look up your favourite show on it, you can look for all of the listed plot devices that show used, and see how it ties in with the rest of pop culture. All of it can seem overwhelming at first to a newcomer, but the associations between your show and the rest of pop culture can be a ton of fun to research.

, This way, you'll be able to live vicariously through someone's fresh excitement over a show you've grown familiar with.

, After you watch a show for the second time, you should think about the ways your opinion has changed towards it. Watching a show a second time means you'll know what happens at the end even on the first episodes. This will frame character arcs and dialogue in a fresh new light, now that you know what the writers were leading up to.

, Sites like IMdB are perfectly suited for hunting down TV recommendations.There are lists of ""best ever"" TV shows you can use as a reference for finding new shows when you feel you're ready to move on. Recommendations are easy to find online. It shouldn't take long to find a few potential prospects that might be worth looking into for your next show.

, Each of the people who worked on your favourite shows have careers that kept going once that show ended. It is likely that each of those people (from the cast or crew) have worked on other shows. If you had a favourite actor, check to see what his or her other credits are. Loved the witty scripts in a show? Check to see what the screenwriter or show runner has been up to since your favourite show ended.

, Friends are a perfect source of recommendations. If you're not sure what you want to watch, it's a good idea to talk to them. See what they've been into lately. Ask if there's a show they think you might be into. Friends are a good source of eyes and ears when it comes to new media. There are way too many shows to look into yourself, so getting others to do the legwork for you will save you loads of time.


It goes without saying that it's preferable to ask friends who have cultural tastes you agree with or respect.

, These can be very helpful, as they'll give you recommendations that your friends might not have heard of before. Sites like TasteKid, IMdB or RateYourMusic will offer you their best guesses as to stuff you might be into, based on the ratings and interests you input in their system.

, Once you start a show, there's nothing forcing you to keep up with it. Watch the pilot episode of a few shows. Give them each a fair chance, and move on if you're not finding it grabs you. You may have to go through a few shows before you find one that seems like it'll be truly worth your time.


Keep the time investment of a new show in mind. Shows take dozens of hours out of your life. That is valuable time that should only be invested if the show is something that really inspires you.

, When all is said, it may eventually come time to jump ship and join a new fandom with a show that's still happening. Go online and make posts about this new show. Look at the fanfiction. Lurk on fan forums and read up on fan theories for this new show. The more you immerse yourself in a new show, the less you'll miss the old one.
