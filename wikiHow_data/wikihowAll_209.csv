, Almost all TV studios are located in big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, etc., and your visit may require an overnight stay if you live far away. Consider choosing a hotel in the vicinity of the studio to ensure you can attend the taping on time, or work in extra travel time.


If you're already visiting a city where your favorite TV program is taped and would like to be an audience member, visit the studio and ask if standby tickets are available. These are typically free and often are distributed on a first come, first served basis, and tend to run out quickly if the program is popular. If you find out these are available, arrive at the studio extra early to obtain one and return later in the day at the specified time.

, Most TV shows follow a strict taping schedule, so take care to plan your visit to coincide with the program's off-season. Shows are often taping during the fall and winter seasons and less commonly during the summer; however, many live talk shows and game shows are recording year-round for daily broadcast. Programs with studio audiences tape most frequently in the morning, late afternoon, and into the nighttime hours.

, Even if you're a loyal daily viewer, there may be a handful of tidbits about the show you didn't know, and these can be helpful when you're attending the taping. Find out more about the studio audience experience, and determine if you want to be selected to appear onstage, if applicable (such as on a game show). It will all make the experience more enjoyable.

, Never rush to be there at the last minute or you risk your seats being given away to standby ticket holders. Your seat location will usually depend on your place in line, so be extra careful to arrive early to avoid being seated in an undesirable row. While everyone will get at least a moment or two to be visible on television, your best bet to get spotted is if you sit up front or at the end of a row.

, Watch closely, listen to the hosts, clap along if a guest singer or band is performing, and enjoy the experience. For most people, attending their favorite programs live is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

If you have any questions or concerns about the conditions of bringing your small-claims case to a TV show versus a real courtroom, consider speaking to a reputable lawyer or other legal adviser.;
, Are you willing to have your case viewed by potentially millions of people? Remember that generally everything you say and do during the case will be televised, and anything demeaning to yourself can have long-lasting ramifications. Do you feel you can maintain a proper dialogue with the presiding judge? Some are patient and humorous; others are renown for their candor and hotheadedness.

, Nowadays, submissions can be made online on the website of the courtroom TV show in addition to by snail mail. Be as thorough and descriptive as possible in your submission about yourself and the case, at least if you want to be taken seriously, and carefully read all of the terms of appearing on the show and how it may affect the litigation.

, Once you submit your case, allow at least a few days to several weeks for it to be reviewed and to receive a response.

, The more materials you can present, the better. Most judges will not be happy with you if you do not bring any materials to back up or explain your side of the claim.

, Start by getting a haircut (if necessary) and finding something appropriate to wear.

Don’t be afraid to fail.",How to Get Started in Stand up Comedy," Take notes as funny thoughts come to you, or write down strange occurrences that strike your funny bone. At this point, you don’t need to be writing full-fledged jokes; just write down situations, lines, or personal anecdotes from your past that seem funny and could be used as material for jokes in the future.If you don’t want to carry a notepad around, many modern phones have a notepad app built in.;
, Based on what you find funny, start to write longer jokes and anecdotes derived from ideas you’ve noted. Look for ways in which you can present material in surprising, unexpected, or bizarre ways. It’s a common move in joke writing to lead the audience in one direction, and then surprise them by reversing the premise in the punch line.Repeat this process over and over: develop a funny idea of observation, pair it with similar funny ideas, and write out a full-length joke or anecdote.For example, if you jotted down that you hate being stuck in traffic and, the next night you went on a bad date, you could work these into a joke about how bad traffic and bad dates seem to go together in your city.

, Comedians—especially standup comics—can learn a great deal from more established performers in their field. Go to your local comedy club as often as possible, and watch all of the online standup specials that you can find.

Pay attention to the comedians: note how they time their jokes, how they move from one topic into the next, and where they seem to draw their source material from.

, Once you’ve written 20–30 jokes or a handful of funny anecdotes you’d like to tell, start thinking about your set list. This will help you organize your ideas into a coherent structure.So, structure your set list to open and close with big jokes. You want to lead and close with your best material. Your audience will be disappointed if you open with a great joke and then end without any equally funny material.For example, if you open with a joke about your childhood, you could structure your set list along somewhat autobiographical lines, and follow with a joke about your adolescence or high school.
When you start performing standup comedy, a set list can be short, even as little as 5 minutes long. If you’re just starting out, it’s okay if there are some mediocre jokes in the middle of your set list.
See how the jokes play to an audience, and then make alterations to your set list accordingly.

, Although a good set list is necessary to succeed as a standup comic, it will fall flat if you stand motionless and deliver every joke with the same inflection (unless you’re a committed deadpan comic). To convey your material well and make the audience laugh, choose a style of standup performance that suits your jokes and your own personality.Some comics choose to be almost manic on the stage, and jump around with excessive energy. Others take the deadpan route and deliver joke after joke without altering their facial expression or delivery tone.
You could also choose to engage mostly in self-deprecating humor, in which you and your life experiences are the butt of most jokes.

, Successful comedians tend to perform specific hand gesture, facial expressions, and body movements to elicit laughs from the crowd. Decide what to do with your face and your body language. You could dynamically move around the stage, or limit your motions to more restrained gestures.For example, you could gesture with your hands to accentuate a point you’re making. Some comics will even incorporate the microphone or mic stand into their act—you can gently tap the mike on your palm or the floor for the sound effect.
As far as facial movements, you can make a funny face at certain points during your routine to accentuate an unexpected or ridiculous point in your joke. Or keep a straight face during the entire performance, and let your lack of reaction offset the humor of your jokes.

, Although memorization can be challenging, it will help you when you’re performing onstage. Your audience won’t find your material funny if you forget jokes mid-act or if you have to read anecdotes from a sheet of paper. Rehearse your entire set list until you can tell it backwards and forwards: practice at home in front of a mirror, when you’re driving to work or school, and when you’re in the shower.Don’t be afraid to revise your jokes or your set list. If you’re rehearsing your material and realize that one or two jokes don’t seem as funny as the others, remove them and swap in other, funnier material.

, Once you think your set list is in good shape and you can deliver it without looking at notes, it’s time to get some feedback. Practice your set in front of any family members or friends who will watch. Listen to their feedback, and respond accordingly.

This can help you be better prepared to deliver jokes before your audience in a crowded room.

, The only way you’ll improve at your comedy performance is if you perform the jokes in front of a crowd. Open mics are a great way to start: they are generally free, don’t put a lot of pressure on performers, and encourage beginners to try new material. If there’s a local comedy club in your area, look at their online calendar and see if there’s an upcoming open mic.Bars, coffee shops, and even some music venues also host open mics.

, Once you start delivering jokes in public, you’ll need to have a comic voice or presence that you use to deliver your jokes. For example, maybe you want to deliver your material deadpan, or maybe you’ll rely on physical comedy to draw laughs. Find what persona and voice works best for your particular type of comedy.Many beginning comedians think it’s wise to imitate an already established comic. In fact, it’s better to just be yourself—performing comedy in the style of an already established comic (e.g. Louis CK, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman) can seem cliché or lazy.

, Just like in any other hobby or line or work, networking—and making friendships—is a valuable way to get yourself noticed. You can also start forming connections with other comics and even venue owners and event organizers.If you see a more established standup comic, introduce yourself and say something like, “I’ve seen you at quite a few of these comedy events around town. Do you know of any good venues for up-and-coming comics?”
Or say, “Do you know any booking or event managers around town who could help me get a show?”

, Once you’ve performed at several open mics and gotten to know a few other comics in your area, it’s time to perform at a more legitimate venue. If you can find email or Facebook contact information for comedy-festival or comedy-club bookers, politely ask if they can feature you at an upcoming show.Starting out, you’ll likely be placed in the middle of a comedy night, sandwiched between two reliable acts.

, No comedian starts out perfectly funny: you’ll have nights where the audience doesn’t laugh at your jokes or where hecklers challenge you. Every successful comic has experienced this as well. Keep going, and book another show (or return to your favorite open-mic) even when things don’t go your way.Audiences can also vary widely from one night to the next. What the crowd on Saturday found hilarious may bomb with a crowd on Monday.

Do a little research on the comedians you will see.,
When you purchase the tickets check, see if there is a two-item minimum.,
Be early.,
Be prepared to interact.,
During the show, don't yell at the comedian.,
Meet the comedians.",How to Enjoy a Comedy Club," Every comedian has an off night but more often than not dislike of a comedian has to do with content. Most headlining comedians have a wide audience appeal but if you are sensitive to foul language or sexual content, then do a quick YouTube search to help you avoid any edgy comic you would be offended by.;
, A common complaint at a comedy clubs is the ""two item minimum"". Most clubs sell snack foods, drinks and desserts. Check the menu online or call the club. Before you invite a friend make sure they are aware of the rule and are on board with the menu.

, Comedy clubs often do not allow you to choose your seats. If you like to sit in the front row get there early. If you prefer to not sit in the front row, hang back and let at least a few groups go in first. Comedy is better when people are sitting close together, so when the show is not sold out the club will sit you together close to the front. If this happens, don't panic. Comedians never destroy audience members unless the audience member gets out of hand or rude.

, When the comedian talks to you, talk back. Live comedy is so much fun because anything can happen. Nine times out of 10 when a comedian talks to you, it is just for fun. They are not looking to embarrass you, just bring you into the banter. The more feedback you give them, usually the less time they spend with you. And keep in mind––it's all just an act.

, People do not enjoy you yelling out comments. People have paid good money to hear a comedian and if you start yelling out drunk comments, you will most likely be removed from the club. If the comedian talks to you, talk back and have fun but if not enjoy the show quietly for the sake of those around you.

, After the show, stick around to meet the comedians. Comedians love performing and after the show, most comedians want to meet you. They enjoy talking after the show.


Taking a picture with the comedian is not stupid. When you post it on your Facebook wall, Twitter account or whatever social media, it helps the comedian to build their fan base. So get a selfie and tag the comedian.
 Don't ask if they know other comedians you know.
Another way to get a comedian to move on from the conversation is tell them a joke you feel like they can add to their act. Chances are the comedian has heard the joke about two people before you. Better to just keep the conversation the same as a normal conversation you have with everyone else.

Apply your improv skills in your every-day life.",How to Do Improv Comedy," If you're considering getting into improv, the best way to know for sure is to take a class. Joining an improv class will teach you more about the genre and give you all of the necessary tools you'll need to be a successful improv actor. There are different levels of improv classes, including a beginner's level, so don't be afraid to join a class.


Even if you end up not pursuing improv, taking a class can be a great way to gain self confidence, improve your communication skills, meet new friends, and spark your other areas of creativity.
Improv classes can be found in almost every city, so look online to find a class near you. If you decide that you're serious about pursuing improv, you should consider moving to a city that is known for it's comedy scene. Some of these cities are Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City.Take a free class with a friend. Some theaters offer free classes to help promote their new classes or their upcoming season.
Go to classes as often as you can and practice regularly.;
, This is also called the 'Don't Deny' rule. This rule means that you should always say yes. If the person you're working with has an idea, build upon what they have created. Do not deny the scenario they have set up, just go with it. Even after you've gotten good at improv, this basic rule should still be followed.


If your scene partner starts the scene by stating that you two are pirates, then you must embrace that you two are pirates. If you deny that you're a pirate, you will discredit your scene partner and cause tension in your scene.

, It's a good idea to always start scenes on a positive note. When a scene begins positively, there are many more directions for the scene to go. However, if a scene begins on a negative note, it doesn't have much room to grow. Scenes that start negatively usually result in the characters fighting or dying.


For example, if you start a scene by saying ""Nobody likes you at school, they think you're so weird,"" there isn't much that can be done with that scene besides an argument. However, if you say ""Everyone at school thinks you're so weird, but in a cool way,"" the scene has room for growth. You can talk about how your character is different, what makes it cool, etc. Make positive statements to allow your scene partners to embrace their characters., Collaboration is the key to successful improv; you cannot create a successful improv scene on your own. Everyone that is a part of a scene must work together and support one another, otherwise the scene will not work. Embrace each other's ideas, give everyone a chance to shine, and give each other opportunities to enhance the scene.


Focus on the overall scene as opposed to your role in the scene. If everyone wants what's best for the scene, they'll be more willing to share the spotlight and let each character have their shine.

, In improv, it's important that you learn how to work well with others, as you'll be creating scenes and scenarios off of one another. When you're working with a partner, both of you should get the same amount of shine. Don't try to upstage your partner, but don't let them outshine you either. Practice working with others so that you can understand a good balance of give and take when doing improv with a partner., You can learn a great deal from watching both bad and good improv. When you go to improv shows, pay attention to what works well on stage and what doesn't. Pay attention to how the audience responds to certain things. Get ideas about characters and personalities that you can develop for your improv.


Going to local comedy shows will also help people become familiar with you. Immersing yourself in the scene is a great way to meet other improv actors and comedians.
Most big cities have at least one improv comedy club, but if you're looking for an amazing local comedy scene, you may want to consider relocating to Chicago, LA, or NYC.
Some well known improv comedy clubs include Second City, Acme Comedy Theater, ComedySportz, Brave New Workshop, The Bad Dog Theater Company, and Groundlings, just to name a few., Watching these shows will allow you to study some of the best improv comedians and learn what makes a good improv performer. Study the good and the bad, and apply what you've learned when you practice.


Some good improv and sketch comedy shows to watch are Saturday Night Live (SNL), Whose Line is It Anyway, Wildin' Out, In Living Color, Mad TV, and Chappelle's Show.
Keep in mind that most of these performers started on a local level as well. They got better over time, and so will you if you apply yourself., Hang out with the friends that you've met in improv class and watch each other practice. Although it's important for you and your improv friends to work together, it's just as important to watch each other from an outsiders point of view. If you and your friends take turns observing each other, you'll be able to provide feedback from the audience perspective.

, The best way to get experience with improv is to perform. Practicing is important, but performing in front of an audience brings another element into the mix. Many improv shows feed off of the audience, so it's important to experience doing improv in front of an audience., As your improv skills progress, you should switch to a more advanced class. This will allow you to work with better improv actors and new instructors, and will also push you to improve your improv chops.


Advanced improv classes often come with other perks, such as workshops with successful actors, discounted or free tickets to professional improv shows, and assistance with head shots and resumes.Head shots are professional photos that actors submit to casting directors when auditioning for roles. Resumes list all of an actors experience and are turned in with their head shots at auditions. When you are ready to start auditioning for different roles, be sure to get your own head shot and resume.

, Many improv teachers are known and respected in their local comedy scenes, so it's a good idea to develop your relationship with them. If your teachers see that you're taking improv seriously, they may be willing to introduce you around or set up some auditions for you.


Volunteer often in class to show that you enjoy participating.
Attend your teacher's comedy shows outside of class.
Ask your teachers what additional things you can do to practice, perform, and immerse yourself in the improv scene.

, If you don't have a real audience to perform in front of, gather some friends and family to be your audience. This will be a good way for you to practice in front of an audience and get comfortable doing improv in front of others.


This can be as simple as playing playing a game of charades with a group of loved ones. It will be a fun time and will allow you to exercise your improv and teamwork skills.

, We all have families, we all have friends, we all have our own lives. Apply improv in your daily routine. Almost all up-and-coming comedians have to keep day jobs to pay rent, so don't be embarrassed that you have one as well. Many jobs will allow you to practice improv throughout the day, so take advantage of those opportunities.


Teaching people is a great way to improvise. Whether you're teaching students, your children, or your friends, try to teach them something new. Each person learns differently, so you'll have to adapt to them as you teach them.
Believe it or not, you can practice your improv skills while working with customers or coworkers. Learning how to interact with your customers and pitch a product is all part of acting and improvising, as is working with difficult coworkers."

Time your jokes very well!,
Dress up as a funny comedian.,
Tell a joke that people could relate to.,
Don't keep repeating the same subject, after a while, you will lose your edge and people might be disturbed by another thing, so always try to change your subjects, and keep the people's attention.

,
If people don't like what you are doing, make a joke out of it.,

, Your outfit reflects your personality to the audience, try to always wear funny tagged T-shirts. You can get them from any place, like Bershka, or other places, but try to avoid extremely classy places like Massimo Dutti or Zara. If you cannot afford a Bershka outfit, try to get your clothes from somewhere where you can buy funny shirts, pants....

, But you must add humor and strive while doing it, you always have to say your jokes in an appropriate tone.

",How to Perform Stand Up Comedy," Do smaller presentations not on stage as much as possible to get used to talking in public. Teach a class in something you know. Volunteer as a Museum tour guide, that will give you a captive audience to try your material. Work up to the bright lights on stage with an audience expecting you to ""perform"" and make them laugh. Work up to that. Go to Open Mics, and give it a shot, that audience is not expecting wondrous things from you, so use it for what it is, a good practice to overcome stage fright. Its simply overcome by you getting up on stage more and more, so keep that in mind. Yes, it can be terrifying, but it can also be the most exhilarating experience you will ever have standing up.

, It should be something you can say a lot about. Many comedians start by talking about their personal experiences—not only is it a topic they know lots about, but it's more successful to make fun of yourself than others when you're starting out.


Research your topic, you will look like a fool if you don't know what you're talking about.

, It shouldn't be drawn out, but it should be long enough to cover your allotted time.

, It may be a cliché, but practice does make perfect. Practice in front of friends and family, in front of the mirror, and when you're in the shower. You can't know the material too well.

,,, This true/insightful/not-necessarily-funny nugget is called a premise. For example, a premise about ""being married"" could be: ""What's weird about being married is that the thing that first attracted you to your spouse will eventually become the thing that will annoy you most.)

This name sometimes ends in “o,” such as “Bozo” or “Cheeko.”Think about your name carefully, because you will use it to market yourself for gigs.

, Clowns always have tricks up their sleeves, from balloon animals to card tricks to handkerchiefs for juggling. Here are some examples of things you might want in your own clown arsenal.


Balloons and balloon pumper for making balloon animals
Handkerchiefs for juggling
Fake thumb tips
“Magic change bags” (for turning something into something else)
Silk scarves
A “trick” deck of cards, Clowns aim to be funny and also tend to do different tricks throughout their acts. Whether you want to make balloon animals, juggle, perform magic, mime, or do a comedic routine, your act will ultimately be a performance. You can also consider humor, especially slapstick humor, when creating your act. When people see clowns, they want to laugh and be entertained. Watch videos of successful clowns (either at the circus or doing freelance work) to see what fits your style and persona.

, Practice in front of the mirror with your costume and makeup done. Make your card tricks and balloon animals flawless so that you can focus on other aspects of your performance.

, Gather a group of people you know and trust to evaluate your clown performance. If you know any other people who clown, ask them to critique your performance. Practice your performance as though it is the “real thing” and ask them to write down comments for you on ways to improve it and things that are working well. Here are some questions you can ask them:


What in my performance was funny?
What was not funny?
What was impressive in terms of tricks?
Did the performance “drag” in any places?
What did you like about my performance?
What did you dislike?
Overall, did it feel too long or too short?
Did anything look unpolished?

, Spend 8 weeks learning about the process of being a clown. You will receive training to develop your clowning skills. You will also receive professional development; after the end of the 8 weeks, the college will facilitate your auditions for different circuses, if you would like., Many groups, like the World Clown Association, exist for the purpose of supporting aspiring clowns.Explore the resources that a clown organization can offer to you, whether it might be mentorship from an older or more experienced clown or a tutorial on how to do makeup more effectively. Many of these resources are available only to members.

, Many clowns start out in the world of freelancing, but, eventually, clowns either focus on freelance work or try to start performing with a circus.Decide which of these options is for you. Do you want to stay in one place to do freelance work, or would you travel with a circus?


Freelance clowns have more flexibility in their schedules, but they do need to market themselves extensively so that they keep getting gigs. If you are an established circus clown, it may be easier to get more freelance gigs. Consider joining a circus for a couple of years and then settling into freelance work.
Circus clowns need to audition and travel with the circus. However, unlike freelance clowns, they do receive health benefits. Many people cannot be circus clowns for their entire careers because the travelling is challenging. Circus clowns may do 500 shows in one calendar year!"

Master in-demand clowning skills.,
Market yourself.,
Perform for free.,
Ask friends to recommend you to their friends.,
Decide on your rate.",How to Become a Clown4," Focus on skills that people typically want from clowns. Getting really good at these skills will allow you to give your customers what they want. Here are some typical clown “acts” that people love to see:


Balloon animals
Small pranks (such as squirting water from a flower)
Basic magic (pulling a rabbit out of a hat)
Slapstick humor
Juggling
Small acrobatics, Create business cards with your contact information, clown name, and photo.Write down your specialties, such as birthday parties, magic tricks, or slapstick humor. Make flyers with this information on them and hang them up in public places (such as coffee shops, restaurants, and toy stores).

, Offer to do a friend’s child’s birthday party free of charge. Many clowns succeed because of word of mouth. If you offer to do one birthday party for free, you might get three more offers from parents at the party.


You can also set yourself up on a street corner to perform for tips. Put business cards out for people to take. Make sure that it is legal in your area to perform on the street. Sometimes clowning on the street for tips is a great way to meet new people and practice your performance., Freelance work is all about growing a network. Ask friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors to help you get more clients and gigs. Make sure that you give them multiple business cards of yours so that they can hand them out to others.

, As you become a more experienced and sought-after clown, you can definitely increase your rate. In the beginning, though, choose a rate that covers all the costs of your performance (such as balloons and transportation) plus a small amount that will increase as you become more experienced. Initially, charge about $100 per hour. More experienced or sought-after clowns can push as much as $500 per hour."

Go to circus school.,
Do a couple of freelance gigs.,
Be prepared to travel extensively.,
Audition for the circus.",How to Become a Clown5," In addition to clown college, you might find it beneficial to enroll in circus school. Circus school will give you a background in a number of different disciplines, including aerial arts, ground skills, physical theatre, and dance.You might find these skills useful as a clown who plans to audition for the circus.

, Try to get some more minor gigs--like birthday parties or festivals--before you audition for the circus. Practice your skills and performance.In particular, circuses look for a good sense of body language, comedic timing, improvisation, and special skills, such as gymnastics or juggling.Every circus will look for a different amount of experience and slightly different skills.

, If you choose to join the circus, you will need to travel with the circus, wherever it goes. Make sure your family knows about your plans. Make arrangements for any pets that you have. Determine if you want to keep paying rent or terminate your lease.

, Look online to find job openings at different circuses. Look into the big circuses, such as Cirque du Soleil and the Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey, but also don’t be afraid to begin your career with a smaller circus. If you've taken classes or known other clowns, ask them if they know of upcoming job opportunities. Apply for every job you think you could do. Although there are many job openings in circus careers, having options is still good.If you have trouble getting auditions or don’t get a job offer, take classes and add more clowning skills to your repertoire."

There is some debate as to the appropriate term, however, and some Star Trek fans can take offense at having the ""wrong"" term applied. This article carries the title of ""Trekkie"" because it's more commonly used but the term that you choose is really up to you to decide, with a little help from knowing the following:


A Trekkie is sometimes viewed as a fan who devotes their entire interest time to Star Trek and does little else.A trekker is viewed by some as a very keen fan of Star Trek who manages to balance other interests in their life as well.The creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, referred to fans as trekkies.Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock, prefers fans to be known as ""trekkers"".;
, Even if you're already an avid Trekkie, if there are holes in your viewing, now is the time to catch up!


Watch the first Star Trek series. The Original Series (TOS) are still aired on TV on some channels, depending on where you live. It is recommended that the best way to catch up on the entire original series is to watch them on DVD because this will ensure that you see them in the correct order. Keep in mind that the special effects are bad compared with what we're used to nowadays because it started as a low-budget show back in late 1966! Be kind in your criticism!

There were three seasons of TOS. All three seasons can be found for free at the CBS website under the tab ""classic shows"".


Watch The Next Generation. Once again, watching them on DVD is best, so you can see them in order. There are 178 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation!
Watch the movies. The movies are:


Star Trek I-VI (1-6)
Generations
First Contact
Insurrection

Nemesis; and
The newest Star Trek movie (2009), it's sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013), and ""Star Trek Beyond"" (2016). Even if you do not agree with the new movies, it still bears the label of Star Trek, but is actually an alternate reality and thus is still canon. That means it's a new timeline, and thus they are NOT prequels.


Continue watching the spin-offs. Deep Space 9, Voyager, and Enterprise. Be sure to pay attention to technology, terms, creatures, and characters.

, They are still being published and there are hundreds to choose from. Maybe at first just focus on the books to accompany your favorite series. To consider yourself a true Trek fan and not a 'dabbler', you must have read some of the books.


One book that is a complete must-have is The Star Trek Encyclopedia. This contains detailed information on STV (or VOY), TOS, TNG, and DS9, as well as the movies. It is the Star Trek ""bible"". And if you're going to be a fully fledged Trek fan you're going need a reference book, for those times in the middle of the night when you absolutely need to go check what episode a certain ship was in, or what year Harry Kim was born.
Search for used copies of books in the science fiction section of your local bookstore, or check an online auction site.

, Memory Alpha aims to be ""the most definitive, accurate, and accessible encyclopedia and reference for everything related to Star Trek."" It can be found at: http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Portal:Main. This wiki contains more information than the encyclopedia because it is constantly updated as new information is created. You'll need it if you want your knowledge to extend further than Voyager's fifth season, and being a part of the wiki means that you can collaborate with other Star Trek fans if wished.


On the internet generally, consider always using Trek themed usernames. For example, Klingonscienceofficer7777777.

, This is a must for the avid Star Trek fan! Trekno-babble is the fast ""techno-babble"" conversation that people on Star Trek always have that only a true trekkie could understand. You will be expected not to get lost just because they talk about all this future stuff. Some of the key phrases to pepper your conversation with include:


""Beam me up Scotty!""
""Make it so.""
""Live long and prosper.""
""That is illogical.""
You're late to work because you had to go to the optometrist. On your way in, you happen to run into your boss and he/she asks you where you were. You can inform him that you had diagnostics performed on your malfunctioning visual sensory organs and the proper corrective measures have been implemented. You'll leave a lasting impression on his/her mind.
Know series abbreviations like STV (or VOY), TOS and TNG, etc. – these are musts. It would be so un-trek like of you to say, ""I got lost in all that high future stuff talk."" Instead say, ""The trekno-babble threw me off.""

Be smart and say long run-on sentences like Data.
Learn stardates. That way, if someone asks ""when is the movie opening?"", you can weird them out by telling them the stardate. See ""Tips"" on how to use a stardate.
Get into the habit of saying ""universe"" instead of ""world"". Instead of saying you're the ""best mom in the world"", say ""you're the best mom in the ""universe""!
There is a Klingon language, and it is helpful to learn it. Do not make up your own version of Klingon. There is a Klingon dictionary by Mark Okrand which teaches you the basics - it's a great way to be able to weird-out those people who are oddly curious yet skeptical about Trek fandom.

, Read wikiHow's article on how to do make the Vulcan peace sign.

, Any Trekkie worth their salt should know the Enterprise inside out!


Know what a Jefferies tube is.
Know how a warp core works.

, There are games you can play by yourself, with a friend, or in a party setting, all themed around Star Trek:



Memorize how many ways Dr. McCoy says ""I am a doctor not a..."". A good exercise in observation and memory improvement!
Memorize Star Trek trivia then have trivia contests with fellow fans. This can make for a great party!
Memorize the movies line by line. For fun, you may challenge another Trekker to a quote war. The first person to be unable to name a quote loses. You also should know which episodes certain famous quotes come from.
Same goes for episode names. Learn all the TOS names first as there aren't so many of those. Then try TNG. It isn't that hard, and it makes things so much easier in conversation if you know exactly what goes on in an episode from its name.

Play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

, Look online for patterns if you can't reverse engineer or fashion a design template of your own.


Purchase a kit if you're not keen to make a starship or other Star Trek model from scratch.
Try to build a phaser or another piece of trek equipment. (Wear protective gear though!)

Make a Starship Enterprise out of a floppy disk.

, Star Trek memorabilia can be purchased online from hobby sites, fan sites, or online auctions. You can probably also find Star Trek memorabilia in real auctions and even in the attics of friends and family! Always be on the lookout for finding great objects to add to your collection.


Put Star Trek pictures all over your walls.
Create a shelf space to place models and other Star Trek memorabilia out on display.
Consider starting your own website with photos of your Star Trek collection for other Trekkies to drool over.

, Attending conventions which feature Star Trek, or include Star Trek fans generally, can be a fun way to meet other Star Trek fans and to really enjoy the spirit of appreciating Star Trek.



Go in costume. This is a must. All real fans have uniforms or other relevant costumes. Check online costume stores or auction stores for ready-made versions, or aim to make your own.
Be in character. For example, read wikiHow's articles on how to act like Mr. Spock, act like Deanna Troi, and act like Julian Bashir.

, If you're good at baking, creating cakes and cookies in the shapes of Star Trek characters, symbols, equipment, and ships can be an enjoyable pastime. Upload your photos to a fan site or a photography site to share with others and inspire them.

Classic or New Series?","How to Become a Fan of ""Doctor Who"""," There are many seasons – past and present – of Doctor Who. Consult your TV guide to find out what stations carry this series (UK: BBC's 1&3, Watch. US: BBC, BBC America, American PBS, etc.) Alternatively, you can find Doctor Who episodes on VHS or DVD; likely soon Blu-Ray as well.;
, You don't need to see all of it straight away. Start with The Eleventh Hour, the first episode of the fifth series of the New Series (or, if you are reading this in the fall of 2014, start in with the first episode of the eighth series as this will be a jumping-on point with the introduction of a new Doctor). If you like that, watch from there to the present. If you don't, or when you finish that bit, watch Smith and Jones, first of series 3, and do the same thing. Then go to Rose, the first of the first series. However there are a lot of story lines that make more sense if you start at the beginning of season 1 with Rose. And of course there are 26 seasons worth of the original series, much of which is out on DVD or available online; as you gain more knowledge in Doctor Who, you may start identifying parts of the older series that you may wish to explore, such as the Doctor's first encounter with the Daleks in 1963-64, or the UNIT era of the 1970s.

,


Try the Channels ""BBC Worldwide"", ""BBC Classics Doctor Who"", and ""doctorwho"".

, To really enjoy the series, you need to understand the following about the series:

, Their home planet is Gallifrey. The Doctor is constantly traveling through Time and Space. In the most recent Doctor Who series, the Time Lords have been exterminated in a huge conflict between themselves and the Daleks, known as the Time War.

, His real name has never been revealed. In many episodes, this is treated as an occasional joke in which someone asks ""Doctor Who?"" when he identifies himself as The Doctor, but recent seasons have added new context to both the mystery of his name and the ""Doctor who?"" question.

, However, a rule exists that Time Lords can only regenerate twelve times (thirteen incarnations). However, in the 1980s it was established that this is is an artificial limit and it is possible to grant Time Lords additional regeneration cycles. The question of the Doctor's continued existence became an issue in the 2013 season. It is possible for Time Lords to change race, and some Time Lords are known to have even changed gender. This has happened to one character, the Master, who regenerated into a female incarnation known as the Mistress or Missy, and one character (a partial Time Lord) did change race. The Doctor once said that Time Lords can potentially live forever ""barring accidents."" As of 2014, there have been thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, and each is referred to by their number, however, the ninth version of the Doctor - for reasons explained in the series - chose not to use the name Doctor, therefore his tenth incarnation came to be known as the Ninth Doctor, and so on. The most recent Doctor, introduced at the end of 2013, is known as the Twelfth Doctor.

, He solves problems chiefly through his wits, rather than violence, although he will engage in combat if needed.

, It has been explained that the Doctor, having travelled for so long, needs to have someone to help him experience wonder again. Companions are also known to have a calming influence on him. The Doctor has travelled with male and female companions, human and alien, but in the TV series he is most often paired with attractive young females. For most of the so-called ""classic era"", romance between Doctor and companion was forbidden (or, at most, only hinted at); in the modern era, this prohibition has been lifted, with the Doctor falling in love with one companion, marrying one, and several other female (and one male) companions have fallen in love with the Doctor.

, This is the Doctor's spaceship – he cannot travel in Time and Space without it. It looks like an old-fashioned British police box. However, inside it's a sophisticated spaceship, and many times bigger inside than it is outside. The Doctor is fiercely protective and proud of his TARDIS. The TARDIS stands for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space. It is designed to disguise itself, but the mechanism for this broke back in the 1960s, so it's stuck as a police box. Oh and one other thing ... the TARDIS is alive, controlled by a female consciousness. For more information check out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS

, A robotic dog-like companion that the Doctor relies on. (Notably through the Tom Baker Years, with a guest appearance in the recent series and featured in two spin-off series, ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" and ""K9""). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-9_%28Doctor_Who%29

,, They tend to yell ""Exterminate! Exterminate!"" a lot. These are reoccurring antagonists. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek


Cybermen These are cyborgs; any similarities between them and Star Trek Borg (introduced 20 years after the Cybermen) is a matter of opinion. They can also be looked up on wikipedia.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman


The Master He was the Doctor's worst enemy in the classic series. Knowledge of him will get you respect among previous generation fans. A fellow Time Lord, he has regenerated numerous times and has been featured in the modern series too. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_(Doctor_Who)


, Doctor Who, as a series, reaches back into the 1960s. The style, writing, special effects, and so on vary a lot from one season to another. If you enjoy classic sci-fi (Lost in Space or original Star Trek, for instance), try classic episodes. If you prefer more modern sci-fi, you can try the 1996 TV movie or the current series. It is important to stress that, while fans use terms like ""classic era"" and ""old series"" and ""new series"", it is all one series and one continuity, unlike other remakes and reboots. If you watch an episode made in 2013, it is part of the same canon as an episode made in 1965; this includes the 1996 TV movie, but not two theatrical films made in the mid-1960s starring Peter Cushing, which were remakes.


Try to track down the W.H. Allen/Virgin Publishing Ltd. Target novelizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s Doctor Who adventures. Most are long out of print (though some have been reissued by BBC Books in the last few years, but you can still obtain them from specialist dealers. Second-hand bookshops usually stock them too. Every televised Doctor Who story between 1963 and 1989, except for a handful, have been adapted as novels. Also, check out the original Doctor Who novels from Virgin Books and BBC Books, which are set in suitable gaps between the Doctor's television adventures and take the series' concept into areas that television technology and budget limitations could never do. There are in the neighborhood of 200 such novels. It should be noted that although the TV series has made the occasional reference, you don't need to read the novels to follow the series.
Since 1999, Big Finish Productions has produced hundreds of officially licensed audio dramas based upon the series. Every actor from Tom Baker to Paul McGann has returned to play the Doctor in these stories, which feature as cast members many top-line actors ranging from David Tennant (playing roles other than the Doctor) and Benedict Cumberbatch to Hayley Atwell, David Warner and actors from Star Trek. Virtually every surviving actor who has played a companion has also reprised their roles, often in long-running spin-offs, such as ""Gallifrey"" - a series exploring the politics of the Doctor's homeworld. Big Finish licence does not allow them to use characters or Doctors from the 2005 revival series (though several actors from the TV series, such as Tennant, have appeared in other parts). The 2013 mini-episode ""The Night of the Doctor"" confirmed that the audio adventures are considered part of the TV series continuity by way of having the Eighth Doctor state the names of his companions from his long-running audio drama series. Big Finish audios are available directly from bigfinish.com and are also carried by online book retailers and many specialty shops in the UK and North America.
Seek Doctor Who knowledge. While you can certainly enjoy Doctor Who without knowing the elaborate history, mysteries, and so on that has developed over the decades, learning these details can greatly enhance the experience. Learn from other fans, web sites, blogs and so on.

The Doctor is a Time Lord, an advanced humanoid race that has harnessed the power of manipulating time. Their home planet is Gallifrey. The Doctor is constantly traveling through Time and Space. In the return of the Doctor Who series in the new millennium, it is revealed that the Time Lords have been exterminated as the result of a huge conflict between themselves and the Daleks, known as the Time War. Hence, visits to Gallifrey are not longer a part of the series but you can certainly see Gallifrey in earlier episodes of the series. All the same, there are lingering aspects of Gallifrey and other Time Lords that continue to run through the Doctor Who series, so be watchful!
The main character of Doctor Who is known only as ""The Doctor"". We're not actually sure of his real name (so far it has not been revealed to the audience), although there are plenty of times when it is shown to be of importance, and indeed, in series 6 (2011), it becomes clear that the question of who the Doctor really is is of some considerable future importance. The show's title is not a reference to his name, but rather an occasional joke in which someone asks ""Doctor Who?"" when he identifies himself as ""The Doctor"".
Time Lords, while they can die, more typically regenerate into entirely new individuals in body, temperament, and outlook. However, they can only regenerate twelve times (thirteen bodies), at least this is what we're currently told. However, it has been speculated that this was only a superficial limit imposed by Gallifrey's leaders on other Time Lords, and the Doctor, being the last Time Lord, may well be able to regenerate as many times as he wants. We presume gender as well, because the Doctor has never become female but this could change. Time Lords are not immortal, as all but two of them died in the Time War (""the Master"" being the other known surviving Time Lord so far).
The Tenth Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant, the eleventh by Matt Smith. These two Doctors have proven wildly popular with audiences. Distinctive Doctors from the past include Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee. If you are just trying to jump into the newer series make sure you start with number nine, by Christopher Eccleston.
The Doctor is always very intelligent, cares about Earth and humans, and defending what's right. He solves problems chiefly through his wits, rather than violence, although he will engage in combat if needed.;
, The Doctor never goes long without a companion or two. Usually these are attractive young females but he has also traveled with male companions and non-human companions on occasion. Although the Doctor isn't very romantically motivated and seems to be mindful of much greater thinking pursuits, it is implied that he fell in love with one female companion, Rose Tyler, who eventually gets trapped in a parallel universe and they are forced to part permanently in a tearful scene. In later shows, the eleventh Doctor is kissed by his companion but it's all the result of ""timey-wimey"" mix-ups and causes the Doctor to realize that he needs to get her husband to come along too.


K-9 is a robotic dog-like companion that the Doctor relies on in earlier incarnations of the Doctor.One of his companions, Sarah Jane, later leaves him and takes K-9 with her, spinning off her own TV series later on.

, The TARDIS hurls through space on another adventure. It is the Doctor's spaceship – he cannot travel in Time and Space without it. It looks like an old-fashioned British police box. However, inside it's a sophisticated spaceship, and many times bigger inside than it is outside. The Doctor is fiercely protective and proud of his TARDIS. The TARDIS stands for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space. For more information check out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS

, The Doctor relies ever more increasingly on his Sonic Screwdriver, a multipurpose tool.In earlier incarnations of the Doctor, this screwdriver has a few useful purposes but in recent episodes, it appears to be able to do everything (and probably can make a good pot of coffee too, if the Doctor asked it to).

, It wouldn't be great sci-fi without the enemies intent on destroying Earth, each other, other worlds and generally wreaking havoc and adding bad vibes wherever they stomp. There are too many enemies to list here but some include:


A Dalek – an enemy of the Time Lords (specifically the Doctor) and the human race. These are an army of cyborgs, genetically engineered mutations inside a bonded polycarbonate shell that look like R2-D2's cousins from hell. They tend to yell ""Exterminate! Exterminate!"" a lot. These are reoccurring antagonists. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek.
Cybermen These are cyborgs. They are emotion-drained humans turned robots with no sense of emotional hold-back when it comes to killing. They seem to turn up almost anywhere, anytime, just like the daleks.The Master. He was the Doctor's friend once on Gallifrey, who turns into his worst enemy in the classic series. Knowledge of him will get you respect among previous generation fans. He is also in the series three (season 29) finale and may well pop up again some time. For more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_(Doctor_Who).

, Doctor Who, as a series, reaches back into the early 1960s. The style, writing, special effects, and so on vary a lot from one season to another. If you enjoy classic sci-fi (original Star Trek, for instance), try the classic episodes. If you prefer more current sci-fi, you can start with the current series. However, if you really want to love Doctor Who and all it represents, watch them all. If you're Gen X, it's highly probable that you have. Both series are great, if you are jumping into the newer series start with number nine.

, Allen/Virgin Publishing Ltd. Target novelisations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s Doctor Who adventures. These are long out of print, but you can still obtain them from specialist dealers and perhaps online. Second-hand bookshops usually stock them too.

You should be able to find these online or on Netflix, but if you have the money a better option would be to buy the box sets.


Many people start watching with the Ninth Doctor, because this is the start of 'New Who'.

The notice also must contain information about the initial hearing – typically an informal conference with the principal – and the process for appeal.
If the school district's rules require you to request a conference, your notice also will describe the process for requesting a conference and the deadline by which you must submit such a request.;
, Find out what happened from your child's point of view, as well as what he or she was told by teachers or administrators who made the suspension or expulsion decision.Listen carefully and try to get a good understanding of what happened. If your child was injured, take pictures of those injuries for evidence as soon as possible after they happened.
If your child has special needs, you have the right to request behavioral screenings and tests to determine whether the behavior was related to the child's disability.

, Schools must publish a written code of conduct and make them available to all students. The code must specify the disciplinary procedures and which violations may result in suspension or expulsion.Make sure the incident for which your child is being suspended or expelled is actually listed in the school's code of conduct as an offense punishable by suspension or expulsion. Otherwise, you may argue that the child had no way of knowing suspension or expulsion was possible.
The school's handbook also typically includes important information about the process when a child is suspended or expelled. Read this information carefully and call the school if you have any questions about the procedure.
The penalty for some offenses is automatic suspension or expulsion. If your child is accused of one of these offenses, there typically aren't any alternatives available – if your child committed the offense, he or she must face the mandatory penalty.
However, most school districts view suspension or expulsion as an absolute last resort for more minor offenses.
If your child has been suspended or expelled for a relatively minor offense, he or she likely has been disciplined for the same or similar violations of school rules on several occasions.

, After you've spoken with your child and understand the rules he or she was charged with violating, make an appointment to meet with the teacher or school official who suspended or expelled your child to find out more about the reason for the disciplinary action.Your child's teacher spends the most time with them in the school setting, and can provide some valuable insight on the situation preceding the incident as well as the suspension or expulsion decision.
In some cases, the teacher may even be on your child's side, and willing to testify on his or her behalf at your conference with the principal or in a subsequent appeal, should that become necessary.
The teacher also may have alternatives they believe would be more beneficial to your child than suspension or expulsion, and can testify that despite any problems it's in your child's best interests to remain in school.
When you meet with your child's teacher, you have the right to request a copy of your child's disciplinary record. Make an effort to get these documents before your conference with the principal so you have full knowledge of your child's disciplinary history at school.

, A student who has been suspended or expelled has the right to a conference with the principal to challenge the disciplinary action. Some schools may schedule these conferences automatically, while others require you to request one.In some school districts, only the principal or vice principal has the authority to suspend or expel a student. If this is the rule at your child's school, the conference with the principal typically is mandatory.
You and your child do not have the right to be represented by an attorney at the conference with the principal. However, if you've talked to someone and want them to appear, you typically can call the principal's office and find out if an attorney is allowed.

, Prepare for the conference by learning as much as possible about what happened, including the events surrounding the specific incident that led to your child's suspension or expulsion.Review your child's permanent record as well as any other documents or information provided to you by the school regarding the incident that led to your child's suspension or expulsion.
If video or photos exist, either of the incident itself or of your child immediately after the incident, get copies of those and evaluate whether they support your child's defense.

, If it seems to you that the suspension or expulsion is unfair to your child, it's probable there are others who feel the same way. You may be able to get teachers or other students who witnessed the incident to testify on your child's behalf.If witnesses have information that supports your child's side of the story, have them produce a written account. You may be able to show these statements to the principal even if witnesses aren't allowed at the conference.
You also should think about getting character witnesses for your child. Church or community leaders who've worked with your child may be able to provide excellent character references.
If your child has special needs, consider getting a statement from his or her doctor or psychiatrist – especially if the behavior that caused the suspension or expulsion is potentially related to his or her disability.

, If you want to defend your child against an unfair suspension or expulsion, it is imperative that you first show up for the informal conference with the principal. You typically aren't able to appeal that decision if you don't attend this initial hearing.Wear professional clothing for the conference, and ensure your child is dressed appropriately as well. Neither of you have to wear a suit, but your clothes should be neat and clean.
Tell your child to avoid torn jeans or graphic T-shirts with slogans or images that might be offensive. If the school has a uniform, your child should wear it, even if they're not attending school that day.
When you meet the principal, treat him or her with respect. You may want to make a statement before the conference begins to the effect that you and your child appreciate the gravity of the situation, and that you only want to do what is in your child's best interests.

, Typically the principal will first explain the incident that prompted disciplinary action and present the evidence in favor of suspending or expelling your child. Depending on the circumstances of the incident, there may be other school officials or teachers present.Keep in mind that this is an informal conference, typically taking place in the principal's office. You aren't going to have to follow the same rules of evidence and procedure that you would in a more formal court setting.
However, don't take the informality to mean you can treat the situation casually. Treat all school officials, especially the principal, with courtesy and respect. Listen when others are speaking, and don't interrupt.

, After the principal is done, you will have the chance to speak on behalf of your child in an effort to prove that the suspension or expulsion is unfair. Depending on the rules of your school district, you may have the right to introduce evidence or call witnesses.Your child has the right to remain silent, both in the conference and any appeal hearing. This can be important if there is a possibility your child will face criminal charges for his or her involvement in the incident.
Typically if your child does decide to speak in his or her own behalf, anything said cannot be used in any other proceeding, including in juvenile court proceedings. Any statements made, by your child or anyone else, can only be used in proceedings related to that particular disciplinary action.
If the principal interrupts you to ask a question at any time while you're speaking, stop and answer the question before moving on and finishing your point. If you want to show photos or a statement someone has written on your child's behalf, it's polite to first ask the principal if he or she is willing to look at it – don't just shove something in front of the principal's face.
Avoid arguing with the principal or any other school officials who might be present, and refrain from making personal remarks or insults. This attitude won't endear you to the principal, nor will it do your child any favors.

, After discussing the matter with you, the principal will decide whether the suspension or expulsion is appropriate in light of all evidence and circumstances. Typically they'll let you know their decision right away, then send a written notification.Try to remain calm, regardless of what the principal's decision is. If you believe strongly that your child should not be suspended or expelled, it can be easy to boil over if the principal announces that the suspension or expulsion will be upheld.
You may want to ask the principal what motivated his or her decision, or to point out any particular facts that were most important. You can use this information in your appeal.
Before you leave the principal's office, get an understanding of the time frame and procedure for appealing the decision so you know what to do next.

, Typically you must request an appeal of the school's suspension or expulsion decision in writing within a few days of your conference with the principal. Each school district has its own procedures, which will be explained to you when you receive written notification of the outcome of the conference.Even if your child has already served out his or her suspension, you should consider appealing the suspension if you believe it was unfair. While the school board can't undo a suspension that's already happened, they can have it removed from your child's permanent record.
Your district may have a form to fill out to request an appeal, or you may have to write a letter. The notice should tell you the specific information that must be included in the letter.
At a minimum, your request should include your child's name, the name of the school, and the date and other pertinent information about the suspension or expulsion, including the offense with which your child was charged.
You may want to make a copy of the suspension or expulsion notice you received and include that with your appeal.
Make a copy of your letter or request form before you send it so you have it for your records. You probably want to send it using certified mail with returned receipt requested, so you'll know when your request was received.
The school board will send you a notice in reply that provides information on the date, time, and location of the appeals hearing. This notice also will include important information about your child's rights, and may explain the appeals process in further detail.

, Typically you'll be presenting evidence and witnesses under rules and procedures that are similar, if less formal, than those in court. Being prepared and well-organized can help your child's case by giving the board members a good impression.Since you often have the right to call witnesses, contact anyone who previously gave you information that supported your child's cause and ask if they would be willing to attend the hearing and testify.
If you do plan to call witnesses, get together with them at least once before the hearing is scheduled to go over the questions you'll ask as well as questions they might be asked on cross-examination by school officials.
Make notes or an outline of the points you want to make in your child's defense and the order in which you plan to present them. This way if a board member asks you a question or you get off track, you can refer to your notes and quickly return to the points you wanted to make.

, Most school districts allow parents and students to be represented by counsel on appeal, and at this stage an experienced education attorney may be best able to protect your child's interests.Keep in mind that even a short-term attention that appears on your child's permanent record can negatively affect his or her future, including college admissions.
The website of your state or local bar association is a good place to begin your search for an attorney. They typically have a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice in your area.
Look for an attorney who specializes in education law and has experience representing children in suspension or expulsion hearings.

, In response to your written request, the school board will send you a notice listing the date, time, and location of the appeals hearing. Make sure both you and your child are available and able to attend this hearing.As with your conference with the principal, you want to wear neat, clean, professional attire – and encourage your child to do the same.
If you've brought witnesses, you may want to meet with them at a nearby location prior to the hearing so you can go over their testimony one more time and arrive at the hearing together.
When you arrive at the hearing room, the board members who will be hearing your appeal likely will introduce themselves and explain the proceeding in greater detail, including rules for introducing evidence or calling witnesses.
Pay attention to any introductory remarks, and don't be afraid to ask questions if there's something you don't understand.

, Since you filed the appeal, you may have the first opportunity to introduce evidence and make your argument that your child's suspension or expulsion was unfair.Following your notes, present your case in an orderly fashion. Speak in a loud and clear voice so everyone can hear you.
If a board member asks you a question, stop speaking and answer it immediately. Don't resume your presentation until the board member indicates that he or she is satisfied with your response.
If you've hired an attorney, he or she may call you to the stand to testify on behalf of your child. Apply the same rules of conduct to yourself as a witness as you would if you were carrying the appeal yourself without benefit of counsel.
Focus on the reasons suspension or expulsion is unfair to your child, rather than attempting to argue your child's role in the incident or whether he or she violated the school's rules.
If your child has special needs, you may want to call the child's doctor or psychiatrist to testify as to the unfairness of suspending or expelling the child, and the problems it would cause or is causing for the child's health and well-being.

, After you've presented your argument, the school will have the opportunity to prove the suspension or expulsion was fair under the circumstances and the decision of the original hearing officer was correct.Avoid interrupting or shouting out while school officials are speaking. Keep in mind that you had your chance to present your case, and now the other side must have an equal opportunity.
If you disrupt or distract from the proceedings, it may reflect poorly on your child as well as the state of your appeal.
If the school calls any witnesses, you typically will have the opportunity to ask them questions yourself through cross-examination. Pay attention while the witness is talking, and take notes on anything you want to question him or her about further.

, After hearing both sides, the school board will make its determination as to whether the suspension or expulsion was fair and the decision of the initial hearing officer was correct.The board may let you know the decision at the end of the hearing, or may discuss it among themselves before issuing a decision. Regardless, you'll receive a written notice of the board's findings and decision.
If the school board does not rule in your child's favor, you may have the ability to appeal the decision to the state school board, or to a county court. You'll get information about the appeals process with your written notification of the board's decision.

First/Second/Seventh/War Doctor - Mysterious
Eighth/Tenth Doctor - Man of romance

, For a Victorian gentleman-esque costume, try for William Hartnell (1), Jon Pertwee (3), or Paul McGann (8). For a fun and childish dress style, go for Patrick Troughton (2), Tom Baker (4), Sylvester McCoy (7), or Matt Smith (11).

BBC America is your best bet if you have access to it, but PBS occasionally shows reruns as well.






Netflix also has seasons one through six available to stream.






You can even buy boxed DVD sets of entire seasons in case you don’t want to watch anything else but Doctor Who DVDs, which is perfectly acceptable.






Bonus points are given in this step if your favorite episodes are also the ones to make you cry, because you need to express the sadness that your long wait for a new season brings. It’s okay to sob mercilessly over “Doomsday” or “The Angels Take Manhattan” for the thousandth time, knowing that Rose or Amy is never coming back to the show. Eat lots of chocolate. It’ll be okay eventually.





;
, If you’re feeling indulgent, invest in several. This is probably the best way for members of fandoms (groups of people that like a specific book, movie, or TV show) to spot each other and instigate conversation.


Doctor Who T-shirts are available in many online stores. The BBC online store (or the BBC America online store for non-Brits) is the best source for licensed material, but ThinkGeek, Redbubble, and Etsy are also great for more artistic tees.






TeeFury hosts a brand-new shirt design every day that’s only available for purchase within a 24-hour time span, and many of their shirts are designed with Whovians in mind.







, Wear it until the threads are fraying and it begins to get bunched out of shape. Display it with as much pride as your fandom warrants. Make sure that any potentially passing Whovians can see it and appreciate it for what it is.


If you purchased more than one T-shirt in step two, rotate them frequently so people can see the full glory of your Doctor Who wardrobe. The eventual goal at this stage is to become known as “that geek who wears nothing but Doctor Who shirts.” That’s when you’ll know you’ve made it.







, There is a ton of available Doctor Who merchandise to match any budget size. Almost anything you can think of can be marketed and sold to Whovians. There are necklaces and bracelets available with Gallifreyan symbols on them. You can also buy pendants in the shape of sonic screwdrivers. Phone cases are practical--and slightly more subtle ways to display your attachment to the series.

, Cosplaying is a term for dressing up and acting like your favorite character from the show. Because Doctor Who has been around for so long, there are more characters to cosplay than you’ll have the time or budget for, so pick one and go to town.


Many forums and blogs offer advice to amateur and serious cosplayers alike and can provide scene-by-scene references so Who enthusiasts can match their character’s costumes down to the stitch.






Cosplay is generally worn to Doctor Who conventions, or to broader fandom conventions like the yearly Comic-Con in San Diego, California. But if you’re feeling adventurous, why not stroll into work as the Doctor or River Song one day?







,


You’re at a formal event and someone’s wearing a bow tie? Don’t hesitate to point out to them that, in fact, bow ties are cool.






Someone’s annoying you by talking too loudly while you’re trying to read, study, or watch TV? Command their obedience by saying, “Silence will fall.”






If you’re feeling particularly villainous, run at them while yelling, “EX-TER-MIN-ATE!”






Regretfully inform your roommate that you’d unlock the door with your sonic screwdriver if you could, but unfortunately it doesn’t work on wood.






Take note of all recurring catchphrases from the Doctor’s incarnations over the years and make it a competition to see how many of them you can use in a single day--examples to get you started are “Geronimo!” and “Allons-y!”

, Your classmate or coworker could be a quiet fan and you might never know it. During a lull in your day, start up a conversation and see who takes you up on it.


If you can’t find a Who fan in your immediate vicinity, forums and chat rooms are great ways to find more distant, but no less awesome, Doctor Who friends. Because the show is so widespread, you might even make friends in other countries. E-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and even phone calls make it easier than ever to keep in touch with long-distance friends who can talk you down from the brink of a hiatus breakdown.

, It is much easier if you note down the brief and important points. Take notes on a notepad, usually as a bullet list or paragraphs.

, You must note that many articles may have multiple purposes (e.g. to entertain and persuade). Identify what you consider to be the main purpose, explaining your reasons in the 4th step if necessary.


To entertain
To inform
To persuade
To examine/explore an issue
To describe/report

Start off with the 1996 TV movie.,
Explore the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels from BBC Books.,
Try reading the Eighth Doctor comic stories that were published in Doctor Who Magazine from the late 90s to 2007.,
Listen to the audio adventures from Big Finish Productions.,
Watch the 50th anniversary mini-sode (as Matt smith calls them) ""Night of the Doctor"", as this is Paul McGann's return to the role after 17 years (this technically makes him the longest running Doctor) and shows how he regenerated into the War Doctor.

,
Know that there are small problems with each form of media.",How to Get to Know the Eighth Doctor from Doctor Who," The movie is a great place to start, since not only does it have Paul McGann as the title character, but it officially ends the classic series and makes way for the new series that we all know and love.;
, These are the continued travels of the Eighth Doctor in book form. Start with ""The Eight Doctors"", as it is the first book in the series. If you have a Kindle, read it on that as buying an actual print is a little over $200.

, These comics have superb art, great dialogue, and shows the darker side of Paul's Doctor. I personally recommend reading ""The Flood"" which is the last Eighth Doctor comic story published in Doctor Who Magazine.

, These audio adventures are great. With these, you have the power to decide the direction. You can have the Doctor wear any costume you want, you can let the companions look like whatever you want, and you can make the enemies as threatening as you want. Here are some good places to start with your audio adventures:


Storm Warning (Very first Eighth Doctor Audio Drama from Big Finish)
Blood of the Daleks Part One (First appearance of Lucie Miller)
Dark Eyes (First appearance of Molly O'Sullivan and the Doctor's new costume)

,, The TV movie had a few continuity errors, which the BBC Books series fixed and explained. The BBC Books are considered to be part of a paradox which happened when the Doctor resurrected Gallifrey after a different Time War from the one in the new series (since in the books, the Time Lords fought the Faction Paradox instead of the Daleks). No one's really sure whether or not the comics stories are actually part of the continuity of the show or not. The audio adventures are the only form of media that have been confirmed as canon.

Try to get at least 8 to 9 hours of sleep if you’re over 12, or 10 to 11 hours of sleep if you’re between 7 and 11 years old., You might be too nervous to eat much, but it’s important that you give your body some fuel to get through until lunchtime. Eat something with protein, such as peanut butter toast or eggs.

, Lay out your outfit for the first day of school the night before. Then you won’t be rushing around for a clean pair of pants or your other shoe in the morning. It will help you start your day off calmly when you can envision yourself walking into school wearing a particular outfit.


If you're wearing a school uniform, make sure to get it early and make sure it fits well. Wearing well-fitting clothes will help you feel better about starting a new school.

, Make sure you leave lots of time in the morning to get to school. You don’t want to be rushing into your classroom after the bell rings. Arriving early may also give you a chance to chat with a few other students and hopefully make a few new friends.

, Your parents have gone through many transitions and have attended new schools. Ask them about how they felt making new friends.


Remember that if you have moved to a new town, your parents are also going through a transition and needing to adjust to a new job or to make new friends. You can ask them about their day too, and maybe even give them some pointers on adjusting to a new situation."
"
Learn the rules of the school.,
Do what your teachers say.,
Do your homework and try to do well in school.,
Make sure you’re placed in the right grade.,
Tell your parents about what went well at school.",How to Adjust to a New School3," Every school has its own set of rules that help students stay safe and learn well. You may need a hall pass to use the bathroom during class, for example. Learning the rules of the school will help you adjust and will keep you out of trouble.

, When you are starting a new school, you should follow your teachers' instructions very closely. You don’t need to be a brown-noser, but making a good impression with your teachers will go a long way to making a positive adjustment to a new school.

, Keeping up with your homework and making a solid effort to do well in school will help with your adjustment. You are already under enough stress with adjusting to a new school that you don’t want to add more stress with poor grades.

, When you move to a new school, your education so far is assessed and you are placed in your grade. Almost all of the time, this will mean that you are placed in the grade you are expecting (for example, if you left your old school in 4th grade and you’re moving over the summer, you’ll start in 5th grade).If you are in high school, meet with a school counselor to make sure you are on track with prerequisites and graduation requirements.

, When you are adjusting to a new school, you might feel lonely or shy. But every day, there are good things that happen, even if they are minor. Telling your parents about these things can help you realize that you are getting used to your school.


Examples include: getting a good score on a test, saying hello to someone new, scoring a goal in PE, and so on.

Learn how to introduce yourself.,
Try to meet new people before school starts.,
Participate in activities.,
Be yourself.,
Make good decisions about making friends.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Keep in touch with your old friends.,Start a conversation with your seatmate is the best way to make a friend.,Sharing your experiences during your vacation is the a good start to make your new friend feel comfortable.",How to Adjust to a New School4," Introducing yourself and starting a conversation with someone new can be intimidating, especially if you feel shy. Once you break the ice, however, you may find yourself in the middle of a bunch of friends. Choose someone to introduce yourself to. Smile and say hello. Talk about something related to school, such as, “We’re in the same English class,” or “When is the assignment due?”Rehearse your conversation by practicing with your parent, sibling or even your pet.
You can also think of other ways to start up a conversation, such as complimenting someone on their clothes or noticing a cool new notebook.

, Making a new friend or two before school starts can be helpful so that you don’t feel so alone when you go to the first day of school. Go to a park in the school neighborhood, or join a summer camp. It can be helpful to see some familiar faces in your classroom when school starts., Sign up for activities like drama, sports or chess club. This will put you into smaller groups with people who have similar interests as yours. This will also give you a chance to demonstrate your skills at a particular sport or other activity. You might even be able to teach some other kids about how to do something., It can be exhausting to pretend to be someone else in order to fit in. Try your best to just be yourself. Don’t worry too much about what other people think.

, When you are in a new school, you have the chance to make friends with anybody. It can be tempting to try to fit in with cool kids. You should, however, spend most of your effort making friends with people that you’re comfortable around. It goes back to the idea of being yourself. Who are the people that enjoy your company because of who you are? Who are the people who treat you with respect?

, By setting goals for yourself every day or every week, you can see how you are adjusting to your new school in very real ways. For example, you can say, “I’ll attend one club meeting this week,” so that when you attend the meeting, you’ll know you’re trying hard to adjust.


Another goal is to try saying hello to 3 new people every day.

, Just because you’ve moved to a new school, that doesn’t mean you can’t have your old friends in your life. Talk to your old friends on the phone or send them emails.,,"
,How to Ask for a Recommendation Letter1,
"
Write out a complete list of possibilities.,
Order the list.,
Aim high.",How to Ask for a Recommendation Letter2," Try to think of everyone who might be willing to write you a positive letter of recommendation in your particular field. Generally, places requesting letters of recommendation will ask for at least two and no more than three, but it's a good idea to think of a larger list, in case any of your ideal candidates don't work out.


Try to come up with at least 5-7 possibilities.

, How you choose to assign ""strength"" to the candidates will be relative, but in general you want to find a balance between the familiarity of the letter writer with you and your work, and that letter writer's standing in the field. While you might have had a better relationship with a co-worker or a TA for one of your classes, a letter from them may be less desirable than from a supervisor or a Professor who also knows your work, but may need some reminding.

, Consider collecting profiles or portfolios of your work to share with potential recommenders who may be less familiar with you and what you do. This is a good way to make contact with a successful person in your field and shows initiative. The easier you make their job, the more likely the candidate will be to do you the favor.

"
"
Collect all the information about both the institution and the application to provide to your letter writers.,
Make contact.,
Gauge their willingness.,
Be timely.,
Follow up and keep in touch.",How to Ask for a Recommendation Letter3," This means you should be nearly complete with the application and be able to provide the supplementary materials to the letter writer for reference. This may include:


Copy of your transcript
Writing sample or portfolio of work
Statement of purpose or cover letter
Curriculum Vitae or resume
Name of the institution
Degree or fellowship program applying for
Name of the contact at the institution receiving the letter
Address and dates for sending the letter
Any necessary letter forms, prompts, or the URL to complete and upload the letter

, Tell the most desirable candidates on your list that you hope to use them as a reference, in person if possible. Inform them of the general guidelines, due dates, and provide them with the necessary resources at this time.

, Ask directly whether or not they're willing to write you a positive letter of recommendation. If not, or they're unsure of whether or not they'll have time to complete it, move to other candidates on your list.

, Professors and academic advisors are generally happy to provide recommendations and consider doing so part of their professional responsibilities. However, because of the sheer volume of requests they receive, you should be sure to request the letter of recommendation well in advance of any admissions application or other deadlines.


A good rule of thumb is making first contact a semester ahead of time to gauge their willingness to write a letter, and then making sure they have all materials at least a month or two before the deadline.

, Thank your references for providing letters with a note or phone call. Also, it's a good idea to keep them updated on your progress. They have a stake in your success, so let them know if you've been offered a spot at the university or program. This will also keep the door open if you need more letters somewhere down the road.

"
"
Provide only the names of professional references to potential employers.,
Give your reference the information that they will need to prepare a well-organized letter of reference.,
Keep references aware of potential calls.,
Be sure to give your reference enough lead time to prepare a well-crafted letter of recommendation.,
Follow up.",How to Ask for a Recommendation Letter4," This may include former supervisors, co-workers, or subordinates as appropriate.


Potential employers do not want personal references, such as from friends or family.
If you are a recent graduate with little related professional experience in your field, recommendation letters from former professors and academic advisors will carry more weight than letters from former supervisors or co-workers in jobs you may have held that are unrelated to the position you seek.

, Make sure your reference has the name, title and full address of the individual to whom the letter of reference will be directed. You may also want to provide your letter writer with a work sample or portfolio, if necessary.


Give your reference a description of the job for which you interviewed so that he or she can tailor the recommendation letter to address the qualifications and expertise necessary for the position.
If a hard copy of a letter of recommendation will be submitted rather than an electronic version, provide your reference with a pre-addressed, pre-stamped envelope as a courtesy and to expedite the mailing of your letter of recommendation.

, If the hiring manager for the job for which you are applying will be calling your references rather than requesting a recommendation letter, then give your reference a heads up to expect such a call, including the name of the person who will be calling.


If you've already interviewed for the position, let your references know what kinds of questions were asked of you, so they might know what to expect from the call.

, Even if you're just starting to think about applying for a new job, you'll know ahead of time this will be a necessary step in the hiring process. Make contact as soon as possible and get back in touch when you have firm dates.

, Thank your recommender for giving you a good reference with a lunch date or small gift. Keeping them abreast of your successes also ensures that you've got a good business contact in your field, someone who has a stake in your success.

Do you hope to find an ""in"" that will eventually lead to a job offer? Do you want to garner more business for your company? Perhaps you simply want to meet people in your line of work and foster a deeper connection with others in your industry.


Your goals will influence which panels you attend and which people you seek to meet. Instead of just going with the flow, plan out your time so you're utilizing each hour to work toward your goals.
Remember that you’ll be more successful if you’re open to other people’s pitches instead of just trying to push your own agenda on people. Getting to know people is a good goal in and of itself, since it leads to long-term relationships that just don't happen if you're tossing out as many business cards as possible without taking time to have real conversations.;
, It's important to know who your fellow attendees will be and what their specializations, business, or expertise is. In particular, look up the people who will be presenting at the conference. They are the influencers who can help you get better connected to your industry, or who may even be able to share ideas with you or give you a little time to talk through projects you're working on.


Take the time to visit the presenters' websites and learn about their backgrounds. If you're aiming to network with someone working for a company, research the company's background, including its history and age, mission, achievements, and principal staff.
If the big names floor you, and you're feeling intimated by the thought of being surrounded by experts, take a deep breath and think about the opportunity that stands before you.

, Introduce yourself to key people and let them know that you look forward to hearing their talks and meeting them in person. They will, most likely, email you back and thank you. Now you'll have a bit of history to fall back on when you see them at the conference.

, Figure out which panels and presentations you want to attend, and map out a schedule accordingly so you don’t miss anything important. You don't necessarily need to go to every single panel, since casual time spent in the break room or at lunch is also a good way to network with people.


Set appointments with people you know you want to meet.Everyone will have a busy schedule, but you could coordinate a coffee break or breakfast meeting with one or more people you definitely want to have a conversation with.
Plan to take advantage of parties and cocktail hours. This is when people let a little more loose, and the conversation gets less stiff. Instead of going back to your hotel, plan on networking into the night.

, Look at the conference website to get a sense of the style you should go for. At corporate conferences, business attire is the norm. If your industry tends to be more casual, you might look out of place wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. In any case, aim to look polished and stylish so you make a good first impression on people.


Some people swear by having an original style element to make themselves more memorable. If you have the personality to pull off wearing a pair of brightly colored sneakers with a suit, go for it. However, a friendly demeanor and great ideas will take you further than anything you could wear.
Don't forget to bring breath mints, a comb, and other items that will keep you looking and smelling fresh throughout the day. Conference days tend to be packed from early in the morning until late at night, so plan accordingly.

, Passing out business cards is an effective way to give out your contact information, although some people might prefer to enter your details directly into their mobile devices. You should also plan to carry a business card binder so you can keep track of other people's cards, too. There's nothing worse than having a great conversation with someone only to realize you lost their card and don't remember their name.


If you don't have business cards, it's worth it to get some made. Keep the design understated and professional. At the bare minimum, make sure the cards have your name, email address and phone number, and the name of your company or your occupation.
If you're terrified of giving out a business card, role play giving a business card to someone with a family member or friend. Introduce yourself first (""Hi! I'm Layla. I emailed you about your web series last week."") Then practice steering the conversation away from you and onto the other person by asking open-ended questions.

, No matter who you're talking to, whether it's the person sitting next to you at a panel or someone with whom you're riding the elevator, be friendly and introduce yourself. Limit your introduction to a succinct 30 seconds, during which you say your name, who you work for and a bit about your background. Presenters, business people, and others associated with the conference will generally be time-limited and won't get much of a chance to stand around chatting with you.


Practice what you're going to say at home, so you know how long it takes and you make sure to include all pertinent information. However, try not to sound rehearsed when you give your spiel.
Pay attention to what the other person says, too, instead of being self conscious about how you came off.

, A good networker is a good listener. When you're talking to someone, focus on that person's answers to your questions and not on anybody else in the room. Limit your own talking and encourage the other person to talk. Whatever you do, no matter how excited or enamored of this person's expertise or importance you are, don't jump to conclusions about what he or she will say next and try to fill it in. Remain calm and let the person do the talking.


Maintain eye contact, nod, and unfold your arms.
Enjoy talking to the other person. Remember that networking is a wonderful opportunity to get to know people, so make the most of it by enjoying it as well as trying to connect.
Be receptive to other people's spiels, too. Plan to accept as many business cards as you give out.

, Go to the talks of those presenters you want to meet (especially if you emailed them expressing interest in doing so). Arrive early and sit in the front row so that you're in a good position to reach them after the talk. Listen attentively so that you can raise particular points with them afterward during your discussion. When the presentation has concluded, introduce yourself, compliment the presenter on the presentation, and ask relevant questions.


Have a list of questions you'd like to ask certain presenters. Consider picking the most important two questions in case you are time pressured.One way of getting assurance that your questions are welcome is to preface the conversation with something like: ""Have I caught you at a good time? I had two quick questions I wanted to ask you.""
Bear in mind that you might be able to arrange to see the person later at a dinner event or similar event during the conference if they're not free straight after their talk. Give them your business card and be sure to make a time to catch up again during the period of the conference.
If you have promotional material, a paper, or any other documentation or software that you'd like the presenter to have, be sure to have it ready and packaged up to give to the presenter.

, As nice as it is to meet presenters, if you spend all of your time trying to meet the celebrity speakers, you’re going to waste the conference. They’ll get hundreds of business cards from other people who also want to meet them. It’s better to spend your time meeting other people in attendance, people you might actually have the chance to work with.Those lower in a company, institution, or organization, have just as much importance as those at the top. They are the people who have time to listen to others. These people will network with integrity and can share good information with you and be important contacts, too.
For example, you might have wanted to discuss something with the professor who just gave a presentation, but he's had to rush back to his baby's birth. If his PhD student is attending the conference too, find her and ask her the questions and share your ideas. If she's convinced that you're genuine and someone definitely worth staying in touch with, she'll help remind the professor about you. Just be sure to keep in touch with both her and the professor after the conference.

, There will be times when someone you're networking with doesn't turn out to be someone you want to connect with. Alternatively, you might start to realize that the other person does not appear that interested in talking with you. In either case, excuse yourself politely, thank the person for his or her time, and continue your networking with other members of the conference.

, Instead of thinking ahead too much about what talking to this or that person will get you, be in the moment and try to truly enjoy the process of meeting new people. If you like the industry you’re in, it should be fun to talk to other experts in the field. You’ll come across as someone worth getting to know better if you seem like you’re genuinely enjoying yourself. You should have as much to offer others as they have to offer you.

, Don’t wait too long after the conference. Get in touch with people while your conversations are still fresh in your minds. That said, you should wait until the day is over before shooting off an email. When the person is still busy at the conference, emailing right away could make you seem too eager.


If you can, send a relevant article to the topic they shared. This will show that you have an avid interest in the topic and that you're willing to share information with them.
If possible, connect the person with other people you know personally or met at the conference. Share information and connections generously, as this will wind up benefiting you later.

, In addition to emailing, connect with people on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter as a way to keep in touch. These mediums are important networking tools, since they help people stay connected and get to know each other better, too. Send a short message with your friend requests reminding the person who you are and stating how nice it was to talk.


If you're especially active on social media, you can tweet or post about the conference while you're still there. Tag people you've met and make positive comments about panels and the conference itself.

, If the person emails you, email back. Don't drop a connection a few days after the conference, because anything can happen. Even if the person doesn't immediately give you a lead on a new job, he or she might do so down the line. Networking is about sharing who you are and what skills you offer to the world, and if you're good at keeping in touch, people will remember you when it counts.


Consider doing your own part to advance your relationship with a connection you've made. If you see an opportunity to actually start working with the person, take things to the next level by asking them out for coffee or lunch, or asking for an informational interview.
If anyone you met calls on you for help or information, give it. You never know when someone new in the field might be in the position to help you one day.

Before getting started, ensure that:


You have computers with the latest configurations.,
Create Google+ accounts at the transmission and reception levels.,
Network the Google+ nodes once the accounts are created.,
Create relevant circles.,
Integrate your Youtube, Picasa accounts with your Google+ account.,
Conduct dry runs.,
Run a few trial sessions.,
Start conducting virtual classrooms with Google Hangouts.",How to Use Google+ Hangouts for Teaching,"
You have a high speed internet connections at each node.
Your internet connection works even without power supply.
You have an alternate source of power to ensure continuous transmission even during power outages.
All your systems are connected to an inverter, so that the transmission is not lost during the switch-over form one power source to another.;
, These are the places from where the teacher is teaching (transmission) and where the students are located (reception). The first prerequisite for creating a Google+ account is having a Gmail account. Log into your Gmail account.On the left side of your Dashboard bar(The strip at the top)you will have an icon ""+you"" by clicking the icon you can create a Google+ account.


Create Gmail accounts for all the nodes (transmission and reception). The Google+ accounts operate through Gmail accounts.

, It is necessary to connect the various nodes with each other by sending and accepting contact requests.

, The transmission node should create subject-wise circles and include the relevant reception nodes in the circle. Similarly, the reception nodes should also create each subject circle and include the relevant transmission node in the circle. The process is very easy – just drag and drop the relevant nodes in the circle.


You can create an unlimited number of circles but be sure you can manage the number you do create.
Have a clear and specific classification for the circles and ensure that all the nodes follow the same classification. This will avoid confusion between nodes.

, This way you can transmit videos & Photos.You can also transmit Power Point presentations,or any file from your screen by clicking the option ""share your screen""

, Test the system and the network at each node. View the audio and video quality and clarity. Make any necessary adjustments to perfect the connections.

, Conduct a few trial sessions on topics of general interest to enable the students and teachers to get acclimatized to the system.


The transmission node should select the relevant circle before starting the hangout.
All the nodes should log in to their Google+ accounts at least fifteen minutes before the schedule of the virtual class. The relevant reception nodes will automatically receive the transmission once they are logged in.
The transmission node should ensure that all the reception nodes are logged in before requesting the teacher to start teaching.

, And when you succeed, share the methodology and success stories with other teachers, to encourage more educators to make use of this easy and enjoyable method of information sharing and learning. If convenient, you might even like to write a few ""How to"" articles on virtual teaching to help others learn more from your own experiences.

To take the test, you must create an account at https://tms.languagetesting.com/IndividualSite/.Once you create a user name and password, you can sign up to take the test. If you also need a teaching certificate, make sure to click through the link for your state.;
, If you're taking the OPIc, you'll be asked questions over the internet by a computer-simulated voice. However, a proctor is required to be present to observe you as you take the test.The proctor must be someone who holds a supervisory position at the school where you take the test. They must be able to provide you with a quiet room to take the test, equipped with a computer connected to the internet and a headset with a working microphone.
When you sign up to take the test on the LTI website, you'll have to give them your proctor's name and title, as well as their contact information.

, The OPIc test is administered on an individual, as-needed basis. There aren't specific times scheduled when you have to take the test. Instead, you supply three dates and times when you will be available.The reason you're giving three dates is so your proctor can confirm the best time when they will be available and have the facilities and equipment you need to take the test.
The earliest of the dates you choose must be at least 10 days from the date you submit your application to take the test.
Make sure you have at least three hours of availability on the dates and times you select.

, Read through the six descriptions provided by LTI and choose the one that most accurately represents how well you speak the language you're going to be tested on. The level you choose determines the test you are given.If you're taking the OPIc for work, or for academic certification purposes, there may be a specific level that you're required to demonstrate. Make sure you know if you need to demonstrate a minimum level of proficiency. , Once you've paid any fees and the date and time for your test has been scheduled, LTI will send you an email. Keep this email, as it includes information you will need on the day of the test.Review the location listed and name of your proctor to make sure they are correct.
The email provides the ID and access code you'll need to use to pull up the test on the computer on test day. You may want to print off a copy of the email and keep it in a safe place so you can be sure you'll have it.

, The Proficiency Guidelines let you know exactly what will be tested for each proficiency level and what you must demonstrate if you want to achieve that level of proficiency.You can download a copy of the most recently updated Proficiency Guidelines from the ACTFL website, at https://actfl.org. Click on the ""publications"" tab and select the ACTFL proficiency guidelines.

, Some university language departments offer courses specifically designed to help you prepare to take the OPIc test. Check colleges and universities near you to see if a course is available in your chosen language.If you're taking the OPIc test to be a foreign language teacher, there may be prep courses available within your program, although there may be an additional charge for these courses beyond your regular tuition.

, The OPIc test evaluates your ability to speak and carry on a conversation. The best way to prepare really is to have as many conversations as you can in that language, until you feel natural and comfortable speaking it.Try to immerse yourself in the language, particularly in the weeks leading up to the test. This will help you think and reason faster in the language.
If you know people who are fluent in the language, tell them that you only want to communicate with them in that language. That can help you prepare for the test as well as get advice on your speaking style.

, The OPIc test is split into four phases, regardless of what level of proficiency you're trying to reach. The test starts with informal warm-up questions, then moves into more difficult questions before winding down.The second and third phases of the test are where you'll really be challenged and have the opportunity to demonstrate your speaking ability. The third phase is designed to push you to the outer limits of your speaking ability.
You'll be given between 12 and 17 questions, each with varying time limits to respond depending on the difficulty level of the question. Expect the test to take you between 30 and 40 minutes to complete.

, Since each test is different, there aren't really any practice OPIc tests you can take. However, LTI does offer a short demo that can help you get familiar with the computer-simulated voice and the basic structure of the test.Go to the LTI website at www.languagetesting.com and click on ""tests."" When you choose the test you're going to take, you'll have access to any available manuals and demos to help you prepare.

, LTI also offers video clips that you can watch if you want to see what kind of answers correspond to various levels of proficiency. While you will be asked different questions, you can still learn from the depth to which the test-takers answered the questions they were asked.Don't worry if the person taking the test seems to know more about a particular topic than you do. The point of the test is to evaluate your ability to speak, not your level of knowledge about any particular subject.

, Before you can take the test, your proctor will have to verify your identity. Check your confirmation email or contact your proctor to find out what forms of identification are acceptable.Since your test is an oral test, you don't really have to bring any other materials (apart from your access code). You won't be allowed to have notes or other written materials in the testing room.

, You will have a computer connected to the internet with a headset and microphone. Your proctor may want you to test the equipment to make sure it works, and then you'll type in the ID and access code from your confirmation email., You'll only hear the questions once, and then you'll have to start talking. Actively listen to the question rather than trying to come up with your answer at the same time. Reinforce specific prompts and tasks in your mind.Some questions or prompts may have multiple parts, or tasks that must be covered for your answer to be considered complaint. The more advanced the prompt is, the longer it generally will take for you to respond.

, When the prompt has ended, take a moment to gather your thoughts before you start speaking. You need to provide some answer to every question or prompt, even if you know little to nothing about the subject mentioned.If you find you've frozen up or are having difficulty getting started, take a few deep breaths and restate the question. That may help you focus your thoughts and get your brain working in that language.

, It may be that you forget part of a complicated question, or that you're asked a question on a topic with which you're unfamiliar. In those situations, be as detailed as possible.Remember the test is designed to measure your ability to communicate in that language – you're not being tested on what you may know about a particular subject.
If you're asked about something you don't know anything about, talk about how you're unfamiliar with the topic, and the things you would like to learn about it. Likewise, if you forget part of the question, it's fine to address the rest of the question and say that you forgot part of it.
Think about how you would handle that situation if you were having a normal conversation, rather than responding to a test prompt. Tailor your response so it's as natural and conversational as possible.

, The OPIc test is designed to measure your speaking proficiency, so the more you speak the more the evaluators have to work with. Include as many details as possible, while maintaining a normal flow of conversation as much as possible.It can help to think of an example, such as a story you heard or an experience you had, that can illustrate a general statement you made in response to a prompt.

Feel the texture of the paper.,
Notice the thinness of the bill.,
Compare the bill with another of the same denomination and series.",How to Detect Counterfeit US Money1," Counterfeit money will often feel distinctly different from authentic money.


Authentic money is made from cotton and linen fibers. This differs significantly from normal paper, which is made from trees. Real money is made to be more durable and should feel crisp despite its age; normal paper becomes torn and soft when worn.
The paper that banknotes are printed on is not sold commercially. Also, the chemical composition of the paper and ink is confidential. Even if you do not have much experience in spotting a counterfeit, you should notice a clear difference in texture.
Genuine currency has slightly raised ink that is produced in the intaglio printing process. You should be able to feel the texture of this ink, especially if you are holding a new dollar bill.
Run your fingernail over the portrait's vest of the bill. You should feel distinctive ridges. Counterfeiters cannot reproduce this.;
, Genuine money is often thinner than counterfeit money.


The process for making money involves applying thousands of pounds of pressure during the printing process. As a result, real money should feel thinner and crisper than regular paper.The only option available to most counterfeiters is to use thin rag paper, which can be purchased at most office supply stores. Still, this paper should feel thicker than authentic money.

, Different denominations will look different, so get a note of the same amount.


If you are still suspicious about the quality of a bill, holding it next to a bill you know is authentic may help you feel a difference.
All denominations, except the $1 and $2, have been redesigned at least once since 1990, so it is best to compare the suspect bill to one in the same series, or date.
While the look of money has changed over the years, the distinctive feel has been left largely unchanged. The feel of a bill made 50 years ago should feel similar to a brand new dollar bill.

Understand the aspects of your life and experiences that most closely relate with the quality of life you desire.,
Explore how your mind makes choices.,
Describe your ideal quality of life with those aspects as categories.,
Convert your goals into SMART goals: SMART is a helpful guideline to be able to make your goals easier to achieve.,
Collaborate with others in your experiments.,
Evaluate the results of your experiments.,
Plan for productive failure.",How to Measurably Improve Your Quality of Life," Which of your behaviors impact your quality of life? A few decades of research on what correlates most with quality of life gives us categories as listed below with a useful mnemonic of 'PERMA' :


P: Positive emotions: The moments consisting of positive moods, perspectives, or sensations, including feelings of happiness, gratitude, closeness, confidence, peace, hope, and inspiration.
E: Engagement: Periods of time when we are so caught up in the moment or activity we are working on that we have clarity and focus, time seems less relevant, and we are risen to our best. This is frequently associated with 'Eustress', which is the polar opposite of distress.
R: Relationships: The quality of our relationships is very highly interwoven with our overall quality of life. The strength of our social support structure or 'Personal Safety Net' is fundamental to many of our coping skills. Resiliency when facing challenges in our lives often stems from past or present interactions. Our relationships may contribute to our quality of life and invoke positive emotions. There are a select few who thrive more abundantly in solitude or in the company of an animal or pet. Often, these individuals focus on their relationship with themselves rather than with those around them.
M: Meaning: How well our work and personal relationships relate to our ideas of fulfilling a ""greater purpose,"" contribute enormously to our self esteem and confidence to continue to strive. The opposite is a feeling that we are wasting our time on trivial tasks that do not contribute to a greater cause. A sense of meaning is often easier to come by if what we do somehow contributes to the needs of a community we are a part of.
A: Accomplishment: A sense of accomplishment is closely tied to how efficiently we are able to complete our ""to do"" lists. But, it can also include the simple positive emotion that comes from completing an already-solved problem like a sudoku puzzle, or level of a video game. H: Health: Not referenced in the original list, but worth including here, is the quality of our physical well-being, including how much pain we are in, how much mobility we have, and what our physical capabilities are. According to Gallups' research on global well being, the quality of our sleep plays a critical role in overall quality of life - if we are not getting enough quality rest, we are far more likely to be emotionally overwhelmed and, in turn, less productive.;
, We make many many choices every day that affect our quality of life, but most of our routines (how we start our day, what we choose to eat) and standard reactions (eating when we are anxious, cursing at other drivers if they frustrate us) are made on autopilot.
Analytical thinking and planning is required to measurably change any of our autopilot habits (how we choose our food) or response patterns (how we respond to frustration while driving). Triggering cognitive thinking in time to make better choices is a fundamental skill. For example, if you can feel your emotions starting to take over, you have a limited window of time in which you can ask yourself strategic questions and make better choices about how to best respond to the situation.

, What habits do you wish you had? How do you wish you could respond in challenging situations? What would a perfect day entail and what would you eliminate? Take five minutes now to write up short wish lists with what you would want in each category.


Start a gratitude journal or a 'satisfaction index' in your diary as a useful way to keep track of your goals. Make a short list of what you are grateful for in your life within these categories. Regularly quantify your current status within each of the categories/aspects by asking yourself: where are the smallest and largest gaps?
Research to help you on your journey. There is a wide range of online sources as well as formal coaching and educational courses. Ask yourself - what have you done in the past to help bridge those gaps? What have others done?

Brainstorm your list of specific goals that, if successfully completed, would help you eliminate the gaps in your quality of life.

, Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound.


Experiment with options for making progress on those goals. What triggers or prompts will help you remember to follow through on your intentions? Consider focusing on the easiest task first to get momentum going to improve your life.

, If you want to change a frequent daily habit, like eating healthier or exercising, partnering with people around you makes it easier to succeed. This becomes critical if their behaviors affect yours and vice versa - work together to design experiments you can try together. For example, one of the easiest ways to eat healthier at home is to reduce the availability of unhealthy food in the home. When you are at a grocery store, you can reduce the temptations of unhealthy food by only shopping in the perimeter aisles unless there's something you absolutely need in one of the center aisles.

, Consider using a daily journal to capture your intentions for the day. Make a list right away in the morning and, in the evening, review and reflect on the results of the day. Each consecutive day, you can then make improvements toward achieving your goals. If you're collaborating with a partner, make time to review results together. As you fall asleep and drift into an alpha state of consciousness, you may find your mind more capable of epiphanies on how to approach your goals in more productive ways.

, Experimenting with change does not mean you have to adhere to every plan. Figuring out what doesn't work is a huge part of figuring out what does. Try to remember things vary from person to person. A very general formula like this one may be adjusted to fit your lifestyle. Either way, never give up and never stop trying.

Inspect the printing quality.,
Look at the borders.,
Observe the portrait.,
Examine the serial numbers.",How to Detect Counterfeit US Money2," Fake bills tend to have a relative flatness and lack of detail. Because making real currency involves printing methods that are unknown and therefore extremely hard to replicate, counterfeiters are often forced to improvise.


Real U.S. bills are printed using techniques that regular offset printing and digital printing (the most popular tools for common counterfeiters) cannot replicate. Look for blurry areas, especially in fine details such as around the borders.
Look for colored fibers in the paper. All U.S. bills have tiny red and blue fibers embedded in the paper. Counterfeiters sometimes try to reproduce these by printing or drawing these fibers onto the paper. As a result, the blue and red fibers will appear to be printed on the paper instead of being part of the paper itself.

, The outside border of real money should be ""clear and unbroken,"" according to Secret Service officials.On Federal Reserve and Treasury seals, the saw-tooth points of the borders should be sharp and well-defined on genuine bills. Seals on a counterfeit bill often have uneven, blunt, or broken saw-tooth points.
Look for bleeding ink. Because of the difference in printing methods between real and fake bills, the border ink can sometimes bleed on a fake.

, Look at the picture of the person on the bill. There are specific discrepancies that will tell you if the bill is fake.


Portraits in fake bills may appear dull, blurred, and flat, while in real currency, the portraits are sharp and contain very fine detailing.
On a real bill, the portrait tends to stand out from the background. On counterfeit bills, the portrait's coloring tends to blend too much with the bill.
Use a magnifying glass to closely observe the rim of the portrait. There should be the phrase ""THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" repeated along the sides of the portrait. This will look like a solid line to the naked eye. This feature is especially hard to replicate using office machine copiers or printers due to its size and detail.

, There should be two serial numbers located on the face of the bill on either side of the portrait. Look at the bill carefully and make sure that the serial numbers match.


Look at the color of the serial numbers on the bill and compare it to the color of the Treasury Seal. If they do not match, the bill is likely a fake.
Fake bills may have serial numbers that are not evenly spaced or that are not perfectly aligned in a row.
If you receive multiple suspicious bills, see if the serial numbers are the same on across all bills. Counterfeiters often neglect to change serial numbers on fake bills. If they are the same, then they are counterfeit notes."
"
Hold the bill up to the light.,
Use an ultraviolet (black) light to look at security threads.,
Check for watermarks.,
Tilt the bill to examine the color-shifting ink.,
Examine the micro-printing.",How to Detect Counterfeit US Money3," For all bills except $1 and $2 dollar bills, there should be a security thread (plastic strip) running from top to bottom.


The thread is embedded in (not printed on) the paper and runs vertically through the clear field to the left of the Federal Reserve Seal. On authentic bills, this should be easily visible against a light source.
The printing should say ""USA"" followed by the denomination of the bill, which is spelled out for $10 and $20 bills but presented in numerals on the $5, $50 and $100 bills. These threads are placed in different places on each denomination to prevent lower-denomination bills being bleached and reprinted as higher denominations.
You should be able to read the inscriptions from both the front or back of the note. Also, it should only be visible against a light source.

, Plastic strips in high-denomination bills should glow a specific color.


The $5 dollar bill should glow blue; the $10 bill should glow orange; the $20 bill should glow green; the $50 bill should glow yellow; the $100 bill should glow pink.
If your bill remains white under a black light, it is likely a counterfeit.

, Use natural light to see if your bill bears an image of the person whose portrait is on the bill.


Hold the bill up to a light to check for a watermark. A watermark bearing the image of the person whose portrait is on the bill can be found on all $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills series 1996 and later, and on $5 bills series 1999 and later.
The watermark is embedded in the paper to the right of the portrait and should be visible from both sides of the bill.

, Color shifting ink is ink that appears to change color when the bill is tilted.


Color-shifting ink can be found on $100, $50 and $20 dollar bills series 1996 and later, and on $10 dollar bills series 1999 and later.
$5 and lower bills do not yet have this feature. The color originally appeared to change from green to black, but it goes from copper to green in recent redesigns of the bills.

, This includes small words or numbers that are hardly visible to the naked eye and cannot be read without a magnifying glass.


Beginning in 1990, very tiny printing was added to certain places (which have periodically been changed since then) on $5 and higher denomination bills.
Don't worry about a specific location. Since micro-printing is hard to duplicate, counterfeits usually tend not to have any.
Counterfeits with micro-printing tend to have blurred letters or numbers. On a genuine bill, the micro-printing will be crisp and clear.

Do not create counterfeit money.,
Remember the passer.,
Contact the authorities.,
Avoid handling the banknote.,
Write down your information.,
Fill out the Secret Service counterfeit report.,
Give the banknote to authorities.",How to Detect Counterfeit US Money4," It is illegal to possess, produce, or use counterfeit money; if a prosecutor can prove that you have intent to defraud, federal law can punish you with a fine and maximum 20 years in prison.


If it is passed to you, do not pass the counterfeit currency on to anyone other by following these instructions. Inspect bills the moment you are suspicious. Remember who gave you which bills.
If you acquire a counterfeit banknote, you must turn it into the Secret Service. Not reporting counterfeit banknotes makes you vulnerable to someone else turning you in for counterfeit banknotes.

, If possible, delay whoever passed you the counterfeit money to remember as much about that person’s appearance as possible. Take note of any accomplices or companions. Write down their license plate number if applicable.


The person who gives you counterfeit money might not be the original counterfeiter. They too might be an innocent civilian duped into using fake money.
It might be impossible to match each passer to each specific bill, so many people inspect bills the moment they are handed to them. For example, many cashiers at general stores will inspect large denomination bills before accepting them as payment. This way, the cashier in the moment can link any potential passer to any potentially counterfeit bill.

, Find your local police department or United States Secret Service field office. These numbers can be found on the inside front page of your local telephone directory or through online search.

, Carefully place it in a protective covering, such as an envelope or sandwich bag. This is so that authorities can glean as much information as possible from the banknote: fingerprints, compounds and chemicals, how it was printed, and so on. This is also so that you cannot forget which banknote was forged, and others are not mistaken.

, Write your initials and the date in the white border areas of the suspect banknote, or on the envelope/bag. The date identifies when the counterfeit was noticed, and your initials identify who noticed the counterfeit.

, When you hand in a counterfeit note, you must fill out the Department of Homeland Security’s Counterfeit Note Report. Find the form here. The URL is http://www.secretservice.gov/forms/ssf1604.pdf.


Once a note is handed in with this form, it is considered counterfeit unless proven otherwise.
Fill out 1 form for each suspected banknote.
This form is geared towards banks who catch counterfeit money, but individuals should use it as well. If you found the counterfeit bill at a bank and you are an employee of the bank, contact your manager and fill out this form regarding your employer.

, Surrender the note or coin only to a properly identified police officer or a U.S. Secret Service special agent. When asked, relay as much information as possible about the passer, accomplices, or any other information you remember about receiving the counterfeit money.


You will not be financially reimbursed for handing in counterfeit money. This is to prevent individuals from receiving money for free, just because they counterfeited money.

Talk with the interpreter before the conversation, if possible.,
Schedule breaks if the conversation is going to be more than one hour long.,
Make sure the room has sufficient lighting.,
Offer the interpreter a beverage and a place to set up.,
Introduce the interpreter.,
Position yourself out of the sightline of the interpreter and the deaf person.,
Pass out any written materials at the beginning of the meeting.,
Speak directly to the deaf person, not to the interpreter.,
Talk in your normal speed and tone.,
Wait patiently while the interpreter communicates your words to the deaf person.,
Have only one person speak at a time.,
Ask the deaf person if she has are any last questions or concerns.,
Thank the interpreter for her work.,
Follow up with the deaf person and the interpreter.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person Through an Interpreter," If you know you are going to have a conversation or meeting in a professional setting where the deaf person and the interpreter will be present, try to meet with the interpreter few minutes before the meeting or the day before the meeting. You can then let the interpreter know how long the meeting will be and what topics will be discussed. This will allow the interpreter to prepare for the meeting and get a better sense of what she will be signing to the deaf person.Make sure you discuss all fees with the interpreter before the meeting. You should both agree on the fees charged by the interpreter or through a referral service for the interpreter. You do not need to discuss the fees with the deaf person, as you are hiring the interpreter and do not need to get the deaf person involved in the payment process.
The deaf person may also have her own interpreter that she prefers to use. You can also discuss hiring an interpreter with the deaf person and see if she has a preference for a particular referral service or a particular interpreter.;
, This will allow the interpreter to take a break and give the deaf person a momentary rest from having to watch the interpreter. The breaks do not have to be long, but having breaks will give the deaf person and the interpreter a breather.As well, It is a best practice to have two interpreters on hand for conversations or meetings that will be longer than an hour and a half. It can be difficult for one interpreter to work for more than an hour and a half at a time. Having two interpreters will allow them to rotate and take breaks.

, If the meeting requires the use of slides, films, or images projected on a screen, you should make sure there is a small lamp or a light next to the interpreter and the deaf person. This will ensure the deaf person can see the interpreter during the meeting.If you cannot get a small lamp, try to dim, rather than shut off, the lights so the deaf person can still see the interpreter. You may want to do a trial run with the interpreter and the deaf person before the meeting to make sure they are both visible to each other.

, Treat the interpreter like a professional and try to be accommodating to her needs. Ask her if she would like a glass of water or a beverage. Have her choose a place in the room to set up, preferably a spot that is well lit and away from the windows to reduce glare. You may offer her a chair to keep in her chosen spot so she can sit down and rest during breaks in the meeting.If you are providing lunch or refreshments for the participants at the meeting, you should offer them to the interpreter as well. Consider the interpreter a participant in the meeting and make sure you include her as part of the group.

, At the beginning of a group meeting, you should briefly introduce the interpreter by saying, “This is and she will be the interpreter for today.” This will let everyone know what the interpreter’s role is in the room and acknowledge her presence for the deaf person. You may then want to allow the deaf person to introduce herself to the group, using the interpreter.If you are meeting the deaf person one-on-one with an interpreter, you should introduce yourself to the deaf person, not the interpreter. Face the deaf person and speak slowly and clearly.Most deaf people can read lips, but the deaf person may also have the interpreter sign your name. The deaf person may also introduce their interpreter to you, but you should avoid addressing the interpreter directly. Interpreters are there to facilitate, not participate, in the conversation.

, Make sure you are standing in a spot where the interpreter can be seen by the deaf person. Do not stand between or in the sightline of the interpreter and the deaf person.You may ask the interpreter where they would like you to stand or have the interpreter stand to the side of you in their chosen spot.
The deaf person may also prefer to sit in the front of the room, close to the interpreter, so she can see the interpreter clearly during the meeting.

, You should start the group meeting by handing out any written materials right away as this will help the deaf person follow along and note anything if she misses the interpreter’s signs. You may also want to create a clear itinerary for the meeting and hand it out so the deaf person is aware of what is going to be discussed., Remember the interpreter is not part of the conversation you are having with the deaf person and is not allowed to voice any personal opinions or enter the conversation. You should make eye contact with the deaf person and position your body toward her.If the deaf person needs the interpreter to explain something, she will turn and ask the interpreter. Allow her to do this, rather than try to do it yourself.

, You should try to speak in your normal speed and your normal tone of voice. Try to not rush or stumble when you speak and project your voice so it can be heard. Take a breath between each sentence as this will allow the interpreter and the deaf person time to catch up with what you are saying.If you are reading a text out loud, speak slowly and clearly. Avoid shouting or yelling, as this will not make it easier for the interpreter to sign to the deaf person and can be considered rude or inappropriate.

, Remember that there will be a slight lag as the interpreter signs to the deaf person. Keep this lag in mind as you speak and be patient as the interpreter finishes signing your words to the deaf person before moving on to your next sentence or thought. This lag will usually be a few words behind your speech. Allow for time for the interpreter to finish so the deaf person can respond and participate in the discussion.If the interpreter is confused or unclear about what you are saying, she may ask you to repeat your statement or ask questions about your statement for clarity. Answer her questions patiently and promptly to keep the conversation flowing for the deaf person.

, It can be confusing and overwhelming for the interpreter when more than one person is speaking at a time. In a group meeting setting, have everyone speak one at a time or take turns speaking around the room. You may also want to give the floor to one person at a time so the interpreter can focus on that person.You should make sure there is a brief pause between speakers so the interpreter has time to finish signing to the deaf person. This pause can also allow the deaf person to collect her thoughts and respond to the speaker.
Avoid talking over someone else or interrupting someone during the meeting, as this can throw off the interpreter and make it more difficult for you to communicate effectively with the deaf person.

, You should wrap up the meeting by focusing on the deaf person and asking her if she has any other questions or concerns. Doing this will allow the deaf person to respond to anything said during the meeting and present her thoughts to the group.If you are having a one-on-one conversation with the deaf person, you may want to end the conversation by asking her if she has any questions or if you were unclear in any way. Often, the deaf person will let you know, through the interpreter, if there was anything she missed.

, As a final courtesy, you should say thank you to the interpreter after the meeting is over and she has fulfilled her duties. You may do this by saying, “I would like to thank the interpreter for her services” at the end of a group meeting.If the interpreter is present during a one-on-one conversation, you may not need to thank the interpreter for her services, as she may be hired by the deaf person and not by you. If you did hire the interpreter, you should thank her formally for her work once the conversation is over.

, You should let the interpreter or the referral service for the interpreter know if there were any problems or issues on your end. You may also ask the deaf person if she found the interpreter’s service useful and helpful. Provide feedback to the interpreter or to the referral service so you can improve your experience in the future or recommend the interpreter for future meetings.You should also be open to receiving feedback from the interpreter about your behavior and presence during the meeting. If you are new to communicating with a deaf person through an interpreter, you may make a few mistakes or missteps. Getting feedback can allow you to recognize what you did wrong and improve your communication with the interpreter and the deaf person in the future.

Determine what type of goal you want to set.,
Identify the reasons why your goal is important.,
Set up a reward system to stay motivated.,
Make your goal as specific as possible.,
Ensure that your progress is measurable.,
Decide on action-oriented steps to accomplish your goal.,
Make sure your goal is realistic.,
Give yourself a reasonable time frame.,
Be aware of your deadlines.,
Identify any potential obstacles.,
Triage your work.,
Find support from friends, family, and teachers.",How to Accomplish a School Goal," There are many possible goals you could set, but the type of goal refers to how you'll measure your progress and success. The two main types are process goals and outcome goals.Process goals focus on the work that you'll do within a given time period. An example of a process goal would be to complete and submit all of your assignments on time this week.
Outcome goals focus on the results of your work. An example of an outcome goal would be to earn a grade of at least 90% on your next test.;
, Having a goal may not be enough to keep you motivated. If that's the case, it may be important to remind yourself of why that goal is meaningful to you, and why you hope to achieve it. Reflecting on the outcome of that goal - both the positive results if you succeed and the negative results if you don't - may help you stay more focused and driven over time.Do you need to do well in a class to pass? Are you trying to improve your grades overall?
Perhaps you want to do well in a class so that you can eventually seek employment in a related field. If this is the case, you'll want to learn as much as possible in that class.

, Some people work best when they know there is some type of reward to be had. Having a self-imposed reward system helps you stay motivated and track your progress so you'll know whether or not you deserve your ""treat"" for the day, week, month, or semester.Consider setting incremental rewards. Set smaller rewards for minor mile markers and bigger rewards for accomplishing the hardest parts of your goal. Imagine climbing a set of stairs. Each stair is a mini-goal that essentially leads you to the main goal at the top.
Decide on some type of reinforcer that will help you stay motivated. It can be a favorite snack, an event you want to go to, a physical object you'd like to buy, or even a vacation or time off from your normal schedule.
Use that reward to motivate you. Agree in advance that you won't get to enjoy your reward unless you accomplish your goal.
Consider asking a close friend to either help you stay motivated or prevent you from indulging in your reward without success.

, Having a vaguely-defined goal can make it difficult to follow through on your efforts and track your progress. However, having a clear, well-defined goal will help you stay driven and know how far you've come.Your goal should be as clear and actionable as possible.
Remember to focus on either a process goal or an outcome goal.
For example, instead of just saying your goal is to get through your math class, figure out what you hope to accomplish. Do you want to become more proficient in math (a process goal), or earn a good grade (an outcome goal)?

, Whenever you set a goal for yourself, it's important to recognize how you've progressed in working towards it. That's why you should always set goals with clear, measurable progress marks and keep track of your efforts every step of the way.Determine in advance how you will measure success. Ask yourself, ""How will I know when I've accomplished my goal?""
Choose both short-term and long-term measures of success.
For example, you might measure success in the short-term by looking at how much studying and homework you get done in a week, and in the long-term by watching how your grades improve over the course of the semester.

, Even a good, well-defined goal could be difficult to achieve without a clear action plan. When you set your goal, make sure you include action-oriented steps as part of your goal development. That way you'll know what you're trying to accomplish and, more importantly, how you'll get there.Be very clear in how you intend to achieve your goal.
Having action-oriented steps means developing clear guidelines that lay out what (specifically) you will need to do at every step along the way.
Think about the steps your goal will require, both in the short-term and in the long-term.
Focus on what specifically you will need to do.
For example, action-oriented steps might include completing your homework ahead of time, reviewing your notes every day after class, and arranging a meeting with your instructor.

, It's important to dream big, but it's also important to know what you can realistically accomplish with the materials you currently possess and the time frame you're given. Don't bite off more than you can chew, but at the same time don't give yourself a task that's too easy.An example of a realistic goal would be to improve your course grade by one letter before the end of the semester. An unrealistic goal, by comparison, would be to turn an F into an A by the end of the semester.
Be aware of what could potentially hinder your success and plan accordingly so that these obstacles do not impede your progress towards accomplishing your goal.

, If you're working within a school calendar, the end of that semester might be the end of your time frame. However, there's still plenty of flexibility in terms of what can be done and when it needs to be done by.Decide in advance when your goal needs to be accomplished.
Once you have a firm deadline, work your way backwards to determine when you need to begin your work and when various milestones along the way must be met.
For example, if you're working within the time frame of a semester, you might decide that you'll accomplish your goal before finals week. That means working backwards to figure out what needs to be completed and when.

, A well-planned, SMART goal is meaningless if you don't keep track of your deadlines and do the necessary work along the way. You'll need to put in a lot of effort if you hope to accomplish that goal, but with proper planning, you should be able to balance that work very comfortably.Schedule your work time and your deadline on your calendar. Get into the habit of setting aside work and study time each day and sticking to your routine.
Offer yourself a reward if you're able to meet your goal on time. For example, you might treat yourself to a nice dinner or buy yourself something special if you improve your grade within your given time frame.
Remove distractions, or remove yourself from distracting situations. If you can't work at home (or in your dorm room) due to distractions there, study in the library and keep your phone turned off.
Let your friends know that you may not be available as much for social events while you work to meet your deadlines. You'll need to avoid temptation by simply avoiding those social events altogether that would interrupt your studies.
Make sure you give yourself enough time before each deadline to get the necessary work done. You'll still have the same amount of work to do if you procrastinate, but you'll have less time and more stress if you put it off.

, Even the best of plans are susceptible to pitfalls along the way. Most of the potential obstacles you'll face are likely of your own creation, but by being aware of them in advance you can reduce the risk of failure.Some common obstacles to school success include conflicting deadlines, extracurricular activities, spending too much time with friends, and distractions like TV, the internet, and video games.
Set limits for yourself. It's okay to spend some time doing fun things, but you have to balance work and play time.
For example, you might decide that you'll allow yourself 30 minutes of video games or an hour with friends, but only after two hours of studying.
Once you've identified the potential obstacles to your success, you can work around them accordingly on your own schedule.

, Sometimes it makes the most sense to start your work where it's easiest. However, if you're worried about budgeting your time, you may find it helpful to focus on the most difficult or time-consuming tasks first, rather than saving them for last.The difficult parts of an assignment may require additional periodicals, assistance from an instructor, and other resources that could be difficult to attain on short notice.
In addition to doing the difficult work up front, you should also be aware of any assignments that build off of other assignments. These may require you to complete other work before moving on to that assignment.
Remember that the more time you give yourself, the easier it will be to get your most difficult work done on time.

, Having support can make a huge difference in your success rate. Not only will the people in your support network help you stay motivated, they can also celebrate with you once you've accomplished your goal.Once you've identified people who can help support you along the way, let those individuals know what you need from them.
Some people might be better at offering kind words of encouragement, while others may be good at getting you to stay focused or getting you back to work when you've started to slack.

Take that idea and flip it on its head - think to yourself ""this idea would never work as an X..."", then challenge yourself and make it work!


Or, take a random idea generator (examples are explored below in Part 3, the step commencing with 'Immerse yourself'). Think whether your activity could be inspired by something in that resource.
Alternatively, look around you and find a random item, e.g. a spoon, and apply it to the learning activity you have in mind, e.g. cultural analysis and comparison through the use of a culture's cutlery - or - poetry about common objects, displayed in their shape to make interesting art works.;
, When making an OER, you need to think not only about the suitability of the delivery platform for the initial intended content use but also its suitability for future (re)use. Delivery needs to be 'open' - freely accessible, no password protection - and ideally editable (at the very least, able to be copied).


You do not need to always make a new website: you could develop and upload a text-based document; create a bank of new images in an existing space; edit an existing space, like a wiki; create a closed resource but share how you made it openly through social media; or you could develop a new webpage. These are just a few examples.

, Good learning resources often take a lot of time to develop through reflection and sourcing content. This is especially true with OERs, as finding open content - or authoring your own images and text, etc. - can take a lot of time. That said, it's well worth the effort.


Often you will find yourself stumbling upon something new and unexpected through your development journey. In turn, this may inspire you to decide to completely change what you initially had in mind. No worries, just run with it! The time you had spent up to then was not wasted, it helped you achieve your new and exciting plan.

, Things can seem scary, then you put flowers in it! Be prepared to take risks and try something new––you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from giving a new idea a go.

, Learning resources are everywhere and so are ideas for new ones. Jump in at the deep end and fully immerse yourself in different spaces and resources. For inspiration and potentially sourcing content, check out the following ideas:


Blogs
Mailing lists
Stumble Upon websites
MOOCs
OER and CC content banks and search engines
Online articles
Social media
… etc. (often the first jump is the hardest, then it's a lot of fun!)

, Do not feel like you have to make everything from scratch - there are loads of great ideas and resources out there, available for use in a new context. It is important to note that content can be used in various ways:


If forming part of the core activity, open access content can be pulled out and reused directly, partially or simply be inspiring;
There is also the opportunity to use or sign-post to other non-CC content, providing you have obtained the author's direct permission to use it in this context (and there is no harm in asking);
However, should the content be supplementary to the core activity (for example, you might also like to look at this link) the sign-posted content is not necessarily required to hold a CC license too (however, should high-volumes of traffic be expected, such as for use in a MOOC, it is polite and thoughtful to give the author a heads-up, as it could be sitting on a personally-hosted server.)

, Not everything on the internet is an open resource - just because it appears open, does not mean there is an open license to use it. This is particularly true for images, where the image may be found in multiple places with different licenses available. It is important to try to find the original image (or at least show that you made every effort to find it) rather than simply choosing the version with the most open attribution! If in doubt, try a different image.


Start from a position of open. Using creative commons search engines to source images where you do not hold the license personally makes the development of open content easier (although do double-check the licenses just to be sure!).
Keep an eye on the particular license of the content, for example, share-alike, which stipulates you must use the exact same license for the final work the resource is incorporated into (more information available in the video)

, If someone has taken the time to create a(n open) resource, acknowledge their effort through attribution. Even if it is not a requirement of the license, it is a good habit to develop and a nice way to say thank you. It also makes it easier for others to use the resource after you.

, So you've immersed yourself in exciting resources, you've been inspired, you have a list of content to use - now all you've go to do is link it back to your vision for the learning activity, applying all the steps and insight previously gained. Again, leave yourself plenty of time!

, Don't forget to apply an open license to what you produce - Creativecommons.org helps you build a suitable CC license for your content, which can be embedded into your resource in lots of different forms. Displaying an open-license badge signifies to other users that your content is part of a growing community of open practice and resources. Lovely!

Check your contract to see if it is transferable. If you are trying to get immediate funds, list your nontransferable annuity as an asset or form of income and apply for a bank loan.;
, Check your contract or consult your accountant to learn about the laws in your state. Most states have laws that protect people trying to sell their structured annuity. If your state has a Structured Settlement Protection Act, your transaction will have to be approved by a state court.The Periodic Payment Settlement Act protects those who received a cash sum as a result of personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, from spending the awarded money too quickly, which may then force them to turn to public assistance to meet their needs.Don’t try to sell a structured annuity by yourself, especially if you are living in a state that does not have a structured annuity protection law. Talk to a trusted broker and attorney before you proceed.

, Before you shop around for annuity buyers, find out what the resale value of your annuity is. Hire an accountant if you are unclear on the details of your investment and its relative worth. Keep in mind that selling your annuity always result in your receiving a lower amount of money from your annuity. You will get a lump-sum payment that is adjusted with a discount rate, meaning that you'll get about 8 to 14 percent less than you would if you waited for the payments., All annuities offer tax-deferral from the time of your initial investment. Your distributions, however, are taxable. This means that your annuity grows tax-free in the accumulation phase, but is taxed as distributions are made to you. These payments are taxed as ordinary income.Gains made by selling your annuity before it matures are taxable as ordinary income. However, losses on the sale are not tax-deductible as investment losses.If you withdraw from an annuity before age 59.5, you are also charged a 10% tax penalty. However, exceptions are made in various cases, such as the death or disability of the annuity holder.
You can also trade your annuity for another qualified annuity contract without paying taxes on the first annuity. These ""1035"" exchanges can be tricky, so check with a tax accountant or investment adviser before proceeding., Your best source for locating a potential buyers is the insurance agent that first sold you the annuity. They understand the market well and will likely have contacts for this sort of transaction. Additionally, they may also charge you a reduced commission for finding a buyer, as you already paid them a commission when you purchased the annuity.Alternately, you can search for an annuity buyer online. Before working with any of these companies, make sure that they:


Have positive, independent reviews of their services.
Have excellent customer service.
Can make a competitive offer for your annuity.
Are licensed to conduct business and follow all appropriate regulations.
Communicate timelines and figures in a transparent way.
Recommend that you first consult with a financial professional before selling.Try checking with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to identify whether or not the company is reputable. Companies with poor ratings from the BBB should be avoided.Some reputable buyers of annuities include JG Wentworth, Peachtree Financial, and Stone Street Capital. These companies can be contacted by phone or through their respective websites.

, If you are having trouble finding potential buyers, or if you can't find the price you think is reasonable, hire a broker. You’ll have to pay a brokerage fee, but you may stand to gain from the expertise of the broker's negotiations. Choose your broker carefully. Check their certifications to ensure that they are licensed to negotiate the sort of sale you want to make.


Ask the broker you want to hire for a quote. If they quote you a percentage, calculate it before you agree.
Look up the name of a broker you haven't worked with before. Any violations or complaints they have might be online., Try to obtain offers from at least five companies before you choose. When you find companies online, use their quote form to get a free quote from them. A quote is not necessarily the amount you would receive, and it may not include the fee that may be deducted when a settlement is reached.


When you fill out the free quote form, give them only the standard information. Your name, email address and the name of your annuity should be the only information they ask for.
Do not give your social security number, bank information, or pay any fees to obtain a free quote.
Give yourself as much time as you can to make the sale. A rushed sale is less likely to get you a good deal.

, Getting an offer of about 80% of the value of your annuity would be considered a good deal.Do not take a deal in which your buyer expects you to pay fees out of pocket before a settlement is agreed upon. Once you have finalized your agreement, all agreed upon court costs, legal fees and commissions should be deducted from the final settlement.

, To sell your annuity, you will need copies of your original annuity application and your annuity policy. If you are already collecting on your annuity, you will need your most recent disbursement check and tax return. If you have a settlement agreement, you will need a copy of that. Bring your valid government issued id, such as a passport or driver's license, and a written declaration that you are selling your annuity of your own free will.


Gather any other documentation your buyer requires, such as a copy of a court judgment for a structured annuity, or copies of any release agreements.

, Investigate the various ways annuity buyouts are made. Remember that no matter what kind of deal you make, the buyer will get the better deal in the long term. You will likely be offered anywhere from 60% to 85% of the value of your annuity. With this in mind, consider alternatives to selling your annuity.


If you are just selling your annuity to free up some cash, taking out a loan might better serve your purposes.

, If you sell as a straight purchase, the buyer will give you one lump-sum payment for your annuity. You will not go on to collect future payments. Choose to sell as a straight purchase if you are trying to get the largest immediate sum possible, or if you have determined that your annuity is not serving its purpose.


If you sell an annuity contract, you will have to pay ordinary income tax on your annuity's earnings., In this case, the buyer purchases your immediate annuity payments for a set period. At the end of that time, you once again collect your annuity payments as scheduled. Consider this option if you have a temporary shortage of cash, but would like to continue investing in your retirement.

, Sell several years of your annuity. For example, if you are now receiving $1,000 per month for the next 15 years, sell your payments from years 5 through 10 only. You will get a lump sum for those years, but still receive your current payments up through year 4. You will then receive no monthly payments in years 5 through 10, but they will resume in years 11 through 15.


Know that this will result in a lower overall payout from your annuity. You will get the money for the sold years up front, but it will be lower than the total value of the payments from those years.
You also need to be sure of the value of the future payments before any deals are made.
This might be a good option if you need money now, but know you will be able to support yourself during an upcoming time period.

, If your buyer makes a split purchase, they will receive part of your monthly payment. If you only need $500 a month and your annuity payment is $1,000, sell half your annuity; you will get an immediate lump sum for the half you don't need, and continue to receive monthly payments of $500.


Even though you've only sold half the annuity, you will still pay ordinary income taxes on the deferred earnings and any gains made on the sale."

Go pro.",How to Keep Hobby Costs Down," It's a fair bet that writing will cost less than motorcycle racing. Money isn't the only reason to choose or avoid a hobby, but you should certainly consider the costs.

Choose hobbies that require time, creativity, skill, ingenuity, or knowledge rather than money or gear.
Light aircraft flying, designer shopping, car modding and playing the latest video games are all likely to be expensive hobbies. Perhaps saving up for them in the future is a better approach than trying to participate in them now without the money needed to make them enjoyable.;
, Gardening isn't a cheap hobby if you decide you need a riding mower and a pickup truck to get it done, or if you change plants as often as you change clothes. Instead, enjoy the challenge and the rewards of growing from seed, transplants, and cuttings. Get smaller plants cheaply and grow them into larger ones. Learn to save seeds if you like to grow vegetables or other annuals.

On the other hand, if you have a large area to mow, a riding mower might be worth the investment, especially if it frees up your time to enjoy the gardening as a whole. Could you share both the mower and the cost with neighbors?

, If you have to drive for hours to see snow, don't ski. Find something else to do outdoors, such as skating or bicycling., You can learn a lot about photography with a $20 secondhand camera and some practice. You can do a lot of astronomy with your own eyes or with the pair of binoculars you already own. Learning the hobby first is also a good way to avoid having stacks of leftover stuff if you tend to switch around frequently.

Borrow or rent to try out hobbies that require large investments in gear such as mountain climbing or hang-gliding, before you start buying. If you find you dislike them or simply don't have time to pursue them, you won't be left with a lot of depreciating equipment.
Learn to be resourceful rather than spend money.
Look for used equipment and materials opportunities. Many hobbyists sell their good condition equipment through clubs, in the newspaper, and online.

, If you enjoy doing something, do more of it using what you already have rather than starting new hobbies or projects frequently.

Sometimes you can use common equipment and build common skills for a single basic activity while enjoying it in very different contexts. For instance, if you're now a classical violinist, you might enjoy ""fiddling"" for folk music, too.If you're now a wedding, portrait, documentary, or wildlife photographer, you might enjoy sports photography (don't buy a monster lens, just increase the ISO a bit) and, while you're at it, learn how to deal with the jumpiest subjects possible.
This doesn't mean you shouldn't try new things. It does mean that you should stay the course, complete projects, and master the hobbies you have already chosen to pursue before chasing new ones.

, For equipment, choose durable items that will last a long time and give you plenty of use. Assuming you will pursue a hobby for a long time to come, plan for your supplies to last a long time., Once you have good, durable equipment, do what is necessary to keep it in good working order. Often, minor maintenance along the way can prevent major maintenance later on. Whether it means rinsing your swimsuit or oiling your sewing machine, take the time to keep your gear in good shape., You can't knit without yarn or quilt without fabric, but that doesn't mean you need to stockpile or hoard yarn. Try to have a project in mind before purchasing supplies.

For some creative pastimes, it is worth keeping some supplies around so that they're available when inspiration strikes. If this is the way you pursue your hobby, gradually build up a reasonable selection of supplies as your budget permits. Then, try to acquire supplies at about the same rate you use them. Keeping your ""stash"" at a reasonable level will also help make it easy to organize.
Try to use up your supplies or ""outgrow"" your gear before buying more.
Keep in mind supplies that go out of stock or change with time. For example, paint or fabric patterns might change if you don't get enough at the beginning of your project. In this case, stockpiling is a safeguard of quality rather than hoarding.
Learn to make the most of simple materials. Some people do incredible, photorealistic drawings with a basic, ballpoint pen. Woodworkers sometimes hold 2x4 contests, where the objective is to make something wonderful from a single building-grade 2x4 board.

, Buy used if it makes sense to do so. Many people stop pursuing hobbies after a time and sell or discard perfectly good, used equipment and supplies. Watch for sales and bargains on the items you buy new.





 One dollar worth of thrift store thread made a scarf, a toy hammock, and a couple of coasters.

Look into getting used gear or supplies, especially your first time out, for costly items. Thrift store yarn or a skein of cheap acrylic will get you a long way to learning knitting or crochet much more cheaply than making your mistakes on fancy yarn. If you have $200 to spend on a bicycle, see if you can get a better used bike for that price than a new one.
If your hobby is seasonal, look for opportunities to get things at the end of their seasons when they are marked down for clearance.
Use found materials, discarded materials, scraps, or remnants. Besides being free or low-cost, scraps can constrain and focus your creativity in unexpected, serendipitous ways.

, Get into do-it-yourself home improvement. Learn woodworking or canning. Grow your own food, or some of it. Riding a bike could save you a lot of money on fuel and wear and tear on your car, not to mention the cost of a gym membership.







Choose complementary hobbies. If you love to ride bikes, try learning how to fix them, too. If you already love to cook, canning or other food preservation methods may be a natural next step. One hobby could save you money on the other and extend your skills without needing a lot of new stuff.

, Cooking and many crafts (woodworking, painting, crochet, etc.) fall into this category, but don't forget things like teaching, storytelling, and helping others with repairs or improvements., It can be incredibly rewarding to help others, and may cost little or nothing. And it soon becomes a very enjoyable hobby., Set budgets both for money and, if necessary, for your time. Set aside a certain amount of money each week, each month, or each payday. You can use a jar at home, a separate bank account (such as a Christmas Club account), or any bookkeeping strategy you want to keep your hobby money separate. Use this money for supplies, equipment, travel, and any other hobby related expenses, and don't go over it., Not all hobbies require travel, but if yours involves travel or going to events, include these costs in your budget, and keep the number and costs of the events you attend reasonable. You can decide what reasonable is for you.

Figure for travel costs, admission, entry fees, hotels, and any other costs associated with attendance.
Attend only local events and meets, or attend the local meets/shows and one or two big regional ones annually. Or consider attending on alternate years.

, If you do race motorcycles, do you really need more than one? Does it need to be the top of the line, or can it be a dependable, mid-range model? Remember that you must maintain it, store it, haul it around, and so on., Some hobbyists make professions of their hobbies, or at least make a little extra money. The level where your sales cover your materials and treats comes quite early, the level you can use it as a second job or live on it takes more skill and more work. Self supporting hobbies often allow you to use the best and most expensive materials and tools as those pay for themselves with better sales and better pricing.

Sell your creations. If you make something in the course of your hobby, get good at it and try selling it. Be sure to price it appropriately.
Sell your services. If you've learned how to repair bicycles or cars, tend a garden, paint portraits, or take photographs, see if you can start a business doing that or work for someone else who does.
Teach your hobby. Offer lessons in doing whatever you've gotten good at.

Write about your hobby. Especially if you have gotten into something unusual, write about your hobby and sell your book or the advertisements on your website.
Invent equipment or equipment modifications related to your hobby and sell those.

Any rental agent will require you to provide the names the drivers of the car. They will need to be over 21, or in some cases 25. If you, or any named drivers, are younger than 25, check the insurance charges before you book your car to avoid being surprised by a high insurance premium upon arrival at your destination.

Do you just want to take on this activity as a hobby part time? These are very important questions to ask yourself before you design your creative workroom. After this you'll need to consider what kind of creative work you'll be doing and what mediums (materials) you'll be using.

Tailor your arts and craft studio to your own needs and preferences. Some artist for example work best in total chaos and mess. Others work best in organization and peace.The steps in this article are really only a starting off point. You can always look through art studio sites, read magazines and books or watch videos and show on the subject to get ideas. It can also do good to chat with an artist who does similar art work or work that inspire you and chat with that person for tips advice and ideas. Different materials and procedures also require different settings. A paint project usually needs more space than a pastel or colored pencil.
Colored pencils and pens don't require much space and can be carried out efficiently in a spare small room. If the majority of your art takes place outdoors or away from home, like on location, you might just need to room to store finished pieces and a nice way to tote materials to the location.
Sometimes an artist just needs a retreat all their own from everybody or a safe place where the kids or pets don't have access to things like paints, sewing machines, and materials. Sometimes artists need to have all their supplies in one place. Sometimes an art studio is just a place to storage art and craft supplies.;
, It's best not to try to make a shared part of the home or a major living area like the bedroom, kitchen an art craft studio. Toxic art materials if not handled correctly may end up contaminating the food, being eaten by accident or the artist burning that nights dinner. The living room or family activity can work if the artist can find quiet time away from the noise and distractions of other members. It can became really distracting and stressful for the artist and others the person lives with. Creating an art studio in the bedroom will cause problems not only with the sleeping partner but can cause sleeping problems for the artist. Also if you work at home or use the home office, crafts or arts can distract you from getting an important job done.

No spare room? You can also just invest in a nice modern craft station and/or easel and use that one place to use as an art studio. You can also further separate from the room with boundaries like houseplants, shelves or hanging fabric from the ceiling. Place it in the corner somewhere in a room. Just have a place to storage art supplies away when not in use.

, You need to not only think about what materials you are using but other additional supplies you are going need and how are you going to store and work with them.

Painting for example can easily go well beyond paints as the career progresses. Where are easels, canvases, paper, or big bottles of gesso going to go? Also many painters also in time will want to use another technique or new material. Each new container of paint takes up space. If one takes up sewing there is a possibility that maybe another additional sewing machine that does a completely different function from the one that person already owns will need to be stored along with the first one . If you plan on photographing and blogging your artwork plan a place to store and keep the camera and computer.
Another thing to consider is that some materials need to be stored under special conditions. Many glues and some paints can't be placed in cold temperatures, some fabrics can't be placed in full sunlight.
Some drawing medias like pencils, chalks, pastels, charcoals will get brittle and dry in exposed locations. Others will melt in moist humid locations. There a many locking and air tight solutions in the food storage department of many stores that can easily solve many of these problems.

, Kind in mind that some materials may have sticky vapors that will cling to walls and ceilings and form ""blobs"" that are impossible to get off.

Chalks, charcoals, and some kinds of pastels can get very dusty and coat anything it touches. Cover sensitive objects and surfaces with protective covers or place these delicate items in containers.

,

Many paints and glues give off fumes when your working with them and need to be used in a well-ventilated room such one with an open window.
Also many craft materials can cause problems with health if ingested or if the material gets on the skin. Chalk dust can also cause sneezing and coughing.Some paint pigments are also toxic if ingested or absorbed through skin.
When doing any art or crafts that require heat like using a hot glue gun, melting wax or wood burning make sure there is ventilation or cooling available so the room temperature is comfortable. This also includes working with machines that get hot while in operation. Anytime heat or electricity is involved have an fire extinguisher ready to go.

, The space doesn't have to be huge but it should be adequate enough to do whatever it is you're doing.

Any artist can make masterpieces in any size room however the artist shouldn't have to bump their head or hands on the walls or ceiling. Consider whether a room is big enough for you to move around freely in as well as doing artistic activities.There should also be ample room to spread an adequate amount of your supplies out in one place instead of having to go back and forth getting supplies.
The smaller the space, also the higher the concentration of fumes and smells coming from the paints in the room in most cases. Small rooms can also be noisy when using loud equipment.
You can use small working places more efficiently by prioritizing your projects and with good placement of materials and workstations. When you are painting and don't have a lot pf room you may for instance get only the colors you are using for the step your doing now and as the paint dries up get your colors ready for the next step. Many awkward small nooks can hold many great storage or activity spots like storing the washing solution bucket and containing the splatters to one spot. A small room can also encourage an artist to leave the room more frequently and take a break.
Big rooms can be overwhelming. The size of a room might make an artist take on too much or too big of a project because the artist feels it needs to be full. Also it's easy to get involved in too many different projects at one time. Bigger rooms also need more maintenance, lighting and cleaning.

, This is not just the paints and brushes.But also the worktable, canvas, easel, paint thinner, palette and drop clothes. A crafts person will also need more than one kind of glue for different crafts. Safety equipment and first aid kits are great in case something goes wrong., Or at least consider going to a professional art store for more traditional versions. There are many relatively inexpensive worktables that are sleek and stylish made of tempered glass and steel. These often also will have drawers and pockets to easily place your pencils, paints etc. A glass table is also good for tracing things without the having to use projector all the time.Tables that tilt at angles are also good. Wood tables can also be a great choice with some of the features as above.


Get a workstation that's the correct height and width. You don't want to be crammed into a corner without ample room to stretch and move about nor should you have to stretch out of shape to reach supplies. Don't forget to have comfortable seating.

, It's best to pick a nice clean white with no other colors.

Picking any other color may cause trouble. Dark colors will absorb lights and make the room darker which is not appropriate for most crafts. Picking any other color besides white will reflect that particular color unto the project affecting it's colors and your project will turn out different colors in a different room or outside. You can always decorate the other parts of the room with your favorite colors keeping the white dominant.

, Excellent lighting is the fundamental of a well designed art studio.

Too much can be just as bad as too much. Poor lighting makes it difficult to do fine details in the work like adding the fine strands of hair to an oil painting or stitching on glass beads to a lace linen. Too much lighting causes glare (reflections off shiny items) and can make colors look faded. Both scenarios will cause eye problems and eyestrain.
Choose your light color correctly. Light colors like paint will affect the tones and hues of your projects and materials. Not all light bulbs and colors are created equal. ""Warm white"" with yellow in it like candlelight or traditional lights can fade colors and make them look duller. ""Cool white"" with blue in it is said to be the artist light because electric companies claim it enhances the colors of the materials.This white color is also called daylight. There is also one called ""pure white"" which has no colors in it and it's the same color as bright white typing paper. The best option in light is a cool white or a good quality pure white.
Consider cool LED bulbs for detail up close lighting. Incandescent, Fluorescent or Halogen lighting can get extremely hot and make it uncomfortable to work around. LED also perhaps won't hurt most materials sensitive to light.
Natural light may or may not be good. The tones of light the sun gives to a room not only varies by the time of day but by many factors. Morning light has more blue in it than Dusk or Sunset light. The storm clouds and also pollution can color the sun an infinite array of colors.Also the colors of things around the window can influence colors in the room.

,

Keep materials organized in appropriate containers. Categorize your materials by brand, type, material or by project. There many specific containers for specific materials. Some storage containers also have locks to keep unwanted guests or curious pets and kids out of potentially dangerous materials.
Don't just dump materials in a huge box or plastic bin. It's practically creating a pile of mess in a box that one has to dig about like a pirate searching for treasure. Don't also put loads of different tiny boxes in one huge container.It's much better to keep lots of smaller boxes on shelves. Save the big bin for larger items.This also will save on straining the muscles and hands.
Think beyond the craft stores when it comes to storage. Many times a hardware or tool shop will have storage solutions often at lower prices and have more possibilities. Tool boxes and chest can provide roomier storage than a tiny plastic case. Pegboards, wine racks, hangers for clothes, can become great solutions for awkward items. Many common place containers that are dark colored like iodine glass bottles after rinsing off can help keep sunlight sensitive liquids from being damaged.
A great way to store things like colored pencils, markers, pens, crochet hooks, is to create a carousel storage compartment or buy one. Get a lazy Susan at any home decorator shop or cake stand that rotates and use plastic storage cylinders or food cans properly rinsed and cleaned or cups and mugs and place your items in there. Old CD and DVD spindle cases can also be used for many storage solutions.If the compartments of the carousel are not permanently built in there's a great advantage of flexibility and more options.






Consider using vertical shelving for small lightweight items. Flat storage up against the walls will save on valuable floor place.
Don't put heavy items on high shelves. Heavy items should be placed on lower shelves and at shorter distances from your workstation.

,

Consider having a portable form of a workstation or table. Whether it has doilies (wheels) or one of those tables that fold up or let the user change the dimensions of the table.
Invest in adjustable shelving systems. These are better options than more traditional shelves because as your creative taste change you can change the space as well. Also if the room has to become a child's room or you need a guest room it easily be converted into another different place.
Give your studio a nice place for lounging. Sometimes you might want to look at the works you created with a cup of tea, play on your Android while waiting for the paint to dry or use your studio as a restful retreat to catnap.

, It's important to have a place to keep samples of materials and all your little notes. It's important for any creative person to have access to color or fabric swatches, inspirations, notes, tutorials.

Keep your color swatches, fabric swatches in real not digital form. Even the best computer screen can not display all colors accurately nor can it display finishes or textures. There is no such thing as ""feel-a-vision"" yet. Also the display settings on any computer can vary causing colors to look different among different screens.
Keep you color swatches in a sheltered place. Some materials are easily faded by exposure to moisture, dust, air or the sun. This also prevents paint or glue from spilling on those precious swatches.
Use the computer and it's many ways of storage to store things like detailed instructions, store information, magazine articles, model numbers. Many manuals are also downloadable via .pdf format online.

,(option) Looking at what you achieved can be awarding and inspire you to be more creative. If your home lacks room to display your finished pieces use your own craft room as a display room as well. This is your place to be yourself in purest form. Don't be afraid to change the display as needed or as you wish. Display your finished works in your studio as you wish.

Be sure to protect painted or stained projects with the appropriate sealer that is waterproof. Also store these things in appropriate containers.
Place paper works in an acid free album or frame with acid free mounting inside. Acid in some framing materials (also fabrics) will cause them to age quickly and become yellowed, discolored or have fine cracks in the material.
Store your finished projects in appropriate containers to ensure that they will last for a long time.

, Making messes is inevitable in an art craft studio and it's best to keep surfaces safe and clean as possible. If the room or floor is not really in good shape or you're into the spill design trend you can skip this step.

When doing a potential messy craft or painting cover the surfaces of the work station with a drop cloth. Use weather tarp, drop clothes or even rags to keep your surfaces clean and usable. When using things like glitter or beads that can be messy getting all over place, keep these medias in a container such as a paper plate and keep a properly sized funnel so they don't roll or fall all over the place. Keep the container being used in another container rather than on the main surface glitter and beads can also be returned to the original container saving inventory and money. This also is a great way to keep crumbly messes to a minimum.
Have anything thing you need handy for cleaning up the media in case of a spill. Water washable material can only needs a nicely sized pail of water or access to a sink.

,

Don't buy what you really don't need! Many of the ""useful"" items like, the colored pencil storage case or that carrying tote for brushes will sometimes just get in the way. Also it's not really necessary to buy huge containers of paint, or multitudes of the same color if your doing only a small project. Paints and glues will loss their quality very often when first opened. It's also easy to forget which identical glue container is already opened or brand new.
Tame those cords, ribbons, wires, threads and chains. It's best to keep long items on a reel like a thread is on a spool. If these are not storage correctly prepare yourself for a jungle of tangled mess and tripping hazards. Try to also keep those electric wires or air gun hoses under wraps with wire organizational products. You might want to use portable, chargeable, battery operated equipment to minimize cord hassles.
Do not keep old catalogs from art stores after a year or two! Prices and products change very often.
Many hobby and craft magazines have their articles online somewhere on the web or are often revamps of older articles and information written somewhere else or on a video site like Youtube. These subscriptions can get annoying and costly for the artist in the form of mental and spacial clutter. Before you subscribe to or buy that book or magazine make sure it's not available in some other more convenient, neater form. Also many magazines only describe the project in the magazine and then the reader has to go online to get the instructions.
Place paper in a container that keeps it from folding/rolling up the edges (becoming dog eared).

, Good labeling that is easy to spot and read will help keep you organized and prevent costly mistakes caused by confusion. If you are a visual person who keeps organization better with pictures use photos or drawings on the storage container. Keep different categories of things in different color containers in a color code system or simply put all similar colors in it's own container or section of the container.

Also if you use more than one of anything that looks very similar like unlabeled crochet hooks, make sure to label them or use a color code system with a color key written down. A color key tells what each color means.Green can be for synthetic brushes and blue for natural brushes. Good labeling also help you seperate your identical paper scissors from your fabric scissors if necessary. Nail enamel or a thin colored tape works great for this purpose.
Do not put any important thing of the studio in a nondescript , unlabeled or poorly labeled bag or box! It's too easy to assume such a container has nothing important in it and later realize that that box or bag going to the trash plant has your new ordered paper or finished project you love so much! Avoid this mishap by investing in clear containers or bags and labeling things in them with a fade proof permanent marker or label. At least you'll be able to see what's inside.

, Oil and/or clean machines and utensils regularly. Tape the ends of delicate ribbons or use fray prevention glue to keep them looking their best. Close glue and paint projects to increase shelf life. Protect delicate and sensitive materials from their enemies. When not in use cover sewing machines, glue guns etc to protect them from dust and grime., You'll want your masterpieces to last forever so you can proudly cherish them for years to come.

Be sure to protect painted or stained projects with the appropriate sealer that is waterproof.
Place paper works in an acid free album or frame with acid free mounting inside. Acid in some framing materials (also fabrics) will cause them to age quickly and become yellowed, discolored or have fine cracks in the material.

Spotting speed traps and police;
,
Taking control of radio, air conditioner etc.",How to Play Shotgun," Remember that the driver can veto any call of shotgun if he/she wishes.

, You are not allowed to call shotgun if you cannot see the car, and you cannot call shotgun in advance. It must be done when you are about to leave. Some other rules to follow are:


Entrance rule. If you call shotgun properly while approaching the car, and then return inside to get something, you have lost your position in the passenger seat.
Volume rule. When you call shotgun that no one else can hear, shotgun claiming is still fair game to anyone. Make sure that at least one person hears you claim your seat, or else anyone else is open to call it.

Barefoot rule. If you quickly grab your shoes, run outside, and then call shotgun, it doesn't count. You must have your shoes on while calling shotgun.
Touch car rule. Once someone is touching the handle to the shotgun seat, before shotgun was already called by someone else, they have automatically claimed the seat. You don't need to call out shotgun once you're touching the handle because you've already marked your territory.
When it's locked. You have called shotgun, and you are now waiting for the door to be unlocked. If you try to open the door while someone is unlocking the door, causing it to remain closed, you are excluded from participating in shotgun for the ride. Anyone else may then call shotgun.

, People will be pretty steamed that you've gotten the best seat in the first place, and bragging won't help. If you really try to be as obnoxious as possible, it could even result in you being kicked out of the vehicle. So stay quiet and enjoy the seat.

, Don't assume that if you call shotgun once, you have passenger seat rights for the rest of the week. Shotgun only applies to the car trip at hand, and does not affect the seating of any car rides in advance. Always be ready to claim your territory.

, The cruise control keeps the accelerator even and prevents sudden surges from stepping on the gas.


Cruise control won't work in favor of your gas mileage if you live in a mountainous area, as the accelerator will be constantly surging going up frequent steep hills.

,, Anticipate having to stop and slow down way ahead of traffic.

, A dirty air filter or worn-out spark plugs can also seriously drain your gas mileage and should be fixed or replaced.


Use the motor oil recommended in your vehicle owner's manual. Motor oil additives can also make a difference. Look for an oil in your car's recommended grade that advertises energy conservation or uses the API performance logo.

,, Not only will this easily increase your gas mileage, it will also reduce the wear and tear on your engine.

Don't use a gear that is too high.

, Anything extra on the outside of your vehicle increases drag.

, It's estimated that for every 250 pounds hauled, you lose 1 mile (1.6 km) per gallon.

, Combine trips to run several errands at once in certain areas of town.

, The drive components increase fuel consumption., Not only is this good for the wear of your car and safety, you may be able to get a modest increase in gas mileage.

Understand how an Airbag works during a collision.,
Position yourself and your children safely in your car.,
Learn how to handle an air-bag equipped steering wheel.,
Tow your car to a repair shop once it has been in a collision strong enough to cause Airbag deployment.

,
If your air bags have unexpectedly deployed, pull your car to the side of the road as soon as you safely can.

,
Schedule maintenance for your car as soon as you can if you get a recall notice regarding faulty air bags.

",How to Drive an Air Bag Equipped Car,"


The letters ""S.R.S."" stand for ""supplementary restraint system,"" which means the Airbag is intended to be used along with your car's seat belts. Your seat belts are the primary restraint system protecting you in an accident.
The seat belts in your car help keep you positioned safely so that, if you are involved in a collision, the Airbag won't injure you when it deploys.
During a collision, a sensor in the vehicle signals the Airbag to ignite a fuse. This fuse explodes and produces nitrogen gas. The airbag deploys 50 milliseconds after a collision severe enough to warrant Airbag protection.;
,


The air bags in your car inflate very quickly. You or your children could be seriously injured or killed if you're sitting too close to an Airbag..
Push the driver's seat back far enough so that, if the Airbag deploys, you aren't injured by the force of deployment. You should have at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space between you and the airbag if it deploys.
Ask passengers to push the front passenger seat back far enough so they won't be injured by the airbags deployment during a collision.
Place a rear-facing infant car seat in the center rear set so the baby in the car seat is at a distance from the Airbag and the force of a potential collision.
Depending on the laws in your state, children may be required to ride in the back seat until they reach a certain age or height. Because of their small size, a deploying Airbag can potentially kill a child.

,


Put your hands on the steering wheel in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions so you protect yourself from broken bones if the Airbag deploys.

Unrestrained bilge pumps can fall over, intake air and become damaged.;
,,,


Hoses sold with a corrugated interior can reduce water output by as much as 30 percent.

,


Bends and additional hosing also contribute to reduced bilge output, so when you wire a bilge pump, the hose should be both short and straight.

,


A submerged discharge will siphon from the surrounding water into the bilge only to have the bilge pump eject it again. This cycle continues until the battery is exhausted.

,,,


Always check the literature which came with your pump for suggested wire size and allowable distance. You may also attempt to contact the manufacturer for a suggested wire size should you be unable to determine the wire size on your own. It is recommended by the ABYC that the voltage drop be less than 3% for this wire run so the use of a voltage drop calculator and ABYC Wire Size Table can help ensure your wire is appropriate to the specifications of your pump and boat.

Keep a box of miscellaneous supplies.",How to Create a Craft Space in Your Home," An empty room is ideal for creating a craft space, but even a corner of a room will work. You can make a craft space out of a garage, shed, or large, walk-in closet as well. Look for a space that has access to natural light. It is also best if the space is quiet and not close to inside or outside traffic.Consider how much room you will need for your supplies and to carry out your craft making.
Choose a space where you will have easy access to electrical sockets.;
, Clear out the space until it is empty if there is already furniture or items there. Once it is empty, clean it thoroughly. Sweep, mop, dust, and remove any stains that may be present. You will want a fresh start to create your craft space., For a smaller space, you will not need to prepare it as much because it will probably already be painted and prepared. You may want to paint a larger space before adding furniture and supplies. Also consider the flooring. Think about carpeting, rugs, or tiling.You can buy paint for the walls at home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowes.
An easy fix for a floor is a large rug that will cover a large amount in the room.

, Consider the size of the space before purchasing or obtaining furniture. A small space will probably not be able to fit a lot of furniture. Your space should at least be able to fit a desk and chair. For a larger space, you will need a desk, comfortable chair, and table, along with organizational furniture.The desk should be large enough to work at comfortably.

, You will at least need to have a table lamp in your craft space. A table lamp is good for small-scale projects that require extra lighting. Look for an adjustable lamp that can be moved to be closer or farther away from the object you’re working on. For a larger space, consider at least two lamps to place around the room.You can purchase lamps at furniture and home improvement stores, like Ashley Furniture and Ethan Allen.

, You will need shelves and/or cabinets to store your crafting supplies. The amount of shelves and cabinets you put in the room depends on the amount of space you have. Choose a shelf or drawer depending on the type of supplies you will be using. Drawers are better if you need more depth, but shelves provide easier access to grab an item when you need it.Organize each shelf or drawer by item type. For example, put all sewing supplies in one drawer. In another drawer, put all of your ribbons and bows.

, Put a rack above the desk to hang items on for easy access. This will save space and will make certain items faster to find. You can hang a rack with hooks, or a rack that acts as a shelf. Racks are typically wooden or made of metal. They can be purchased at most home improvement stores.You can hang items like scissors and spools of thread on a rack.

, Use items like jars, small boxes, and dishes to hold small crafting supplies. Glass jars are best for pencils and pens. They can be kept on the desk. Small boxes are good for holding things like beads and pins. Use small plates to display small baubles and decorative items.Keep one type of item in each storage container. For example, keep all pens in a separate jar from all pencils.

, Hang a board somewhere in the room, like above the desk, to attach ideas and other items to. This can act as a “vision” board, or simply as a place to put reminders. A corkboard works best, but you can also use a board covered in fabric. Use thumbtacks or pins to attach sheets of paper or pictures to the board.A vision board is great for keeping papers, pictures, and fabric samples to aid with current and previous projects.

, Buy or create labels to label your organizational items. Labeling will make finding, returning, and keeping your crafting supplies organized easier. You can create the labels by using a label maker, or writing the labels out with a pen or marker.You can also create labels by attaching tape to small strips of paper.

, You will probably use paper at some point during your crafting. Some types of paper that are good to have in a craft room are scrap book paper, wrapping paper, white cardstock, and color paper. Paper can be bought at craft stores and stored in its own compartment in a drawer or shelf., Coloring and painting supplies are necessary for decorating crafts. Some coloring supplies to invest in are colored pencils, crayons, markers, and sharpies. Painting supplies to buy are acrylic, oil, or watercolor paint, chalkboard paint, glitter paint, and brushes. You should also have a palette and cup available for mixing and applying paint., Glue, tape, and other adhesives will come in handy at some point during crafting. Mod Podge, Fabric glue, Elmer’s Glue, Super Glue, and a hot glue gun with glue sticks are some types of glues that are good to keep in a crafting space. For tape, scotch tape, double sided tape, command strips, and painters tape are helpful to keep around.You do not have to invest in all of the types of glues and tapes listed above all at once. Consider what type of crafting you will do most before purchasing supplies.

, It is helpful to have cutting supplies nearby during crafting. You should have at least one pair of regular sharp scissors, although it is good to have a few pairs available in different sizes. An X-acto knife and/or box cutter is needed for projects that require a more precise cut.You should also keep a cutting board near your scissors and razors to avoid cutting into the desk or floor.

, If you will be sewing, keep your supplies together in a corner of the room. This includes a sewing machine, needles, thread, or any other items you may need to sew. Keep your sewing supplies in a box or drawer close to the sewing machine., Random supplies are sure to accumulate after multiple crafting experiences. Keep these items in a separate box marked “miscellaneous.” It is also helpful to purchase some miscellaneous supplies to keep around. Some items that may be useful are stamps, stencils, stickers, pieces of fabric, and a hole puncher."

Position the boat on the trailer securely.,
Hose down the exterior of the boat first.,
Clean the old wax from the surface.,
Wash with a proper detergent.,
Consider using a polish or buffing compound.,
Begin at the transom and work toward the bow.,
Follow up use of a buffing compound by applying polish.,
Choose an appropriate variety of boating wax.,
Use the same motion as with applying the buffing compound.,
Exercise care around fittings and in tight spaces.,
Allow the wax to dry.,
Buff the wax to a shine.",How to Wax Your Boat," Boats should be waxed out of the water, secured on the trailer, preferably parked on a flat, even surface. Because you'll be spraying products and moving all around the boat, you'll probably not want to have the trailer attached to your car, either.


Depending on the style of your boat, you'll probably want to put the cover on before you get started waxing and cleaning the boat. To keep the interior safe, keep the cover on.;
, It’s important to only wax a recently-cleaned boat, so remove all loose dirt and grime, as well as algae buildup and other gunk, especially if the boat’s been sitting in the water.


Start with plain water, spraying evenly across the surface of the exterior that needs to be cleaned. Use a clean, wet sponge to start scrubbing gently and get the grime running off.
If there are really serious spots of build-up, you can use some fine-grain 220 sandpaper to clean it off. Don't use a power washer on your boat, which can damage the finish and affect the efficacy of the gelcoat. Use a gentle spray, as opposed to a powerful spray.

, Use rags soaked with toluene or another dewaxing solvent to remove traces of old wax, which can keep polish and rubbing compounds from working evenly across the surface of the boat.


Sweep the rag in one direction, applying light pressure. It's not something you should usually have to scrub very hard to remove. Allow the solvent to evaporate before buffing.

, Finish washing the surface with a sponge and special boat soap or a mild solution of dishwashing detergent and warm water.


If the surface of your boat is stained, it's sometimes common to use a small amount of bleach to disinfect and clean thoroughly. It's also sometimes common to use lacquer thinner, Varsol or a special degreaser to remove sticky adhesive spots or greasy buildup. Don't use bleach on untreated or unstained wooden boats.
Rinse the boat thoroughly with clean water and allow to dry. You can use a squeegee to speed up the drying process, if necessary.

, Both polish and buffing compound are abrasives, which restore the shine to your boat’s fiberglass gelcoat by removing imperfections, discolorations and scrapes in the surface, increasing the reflective shine.


Choose polish if your boat only needs light refinishing. Go with a stronger rubbing compound if the surface is excessively pitted or chalky, signs that the surface needs a much more substantial cleaning.
Be very careful when using a rubbing compound. Gelcoat is extremely thin and an aggressive compound can burn through it quickly, necessitating an expensive and time-consuming repair job., Work in sections about 2 feet (0.610 meters) square to apply the rubbing compound or polish. Use a soft cloth if you’re working by hand, or fit the buffer with a foam polishing pad. Apply a circle of polish or buffing compound to the cloth or pad and rub it into the surface using a steady, even, circular motion. Buff until the surface becomes glassy looking. If you can see through the gelcoat, you’ve gone too far.


Some purists swear by hand buffing, while others argue that using a tool saves your muscles and helps eliminate streaks and swirls. Choose a low-speed buffer, not a high-speed sander, for better control. Tools with an orbital motion are less likely to leave swirling streaks.
If you’re using a buffer, start at the slowest speed. Touch the pad lightly to the surface before starting the buffer so the polish or compound doesn’t spray in all directions.

, If necessary, apply polish using the same method. Use circular motions and move in the same direction you moved when applying the rubbing compound. Hose off the boat and the work area to remove the dust raised by the polishing and compounding.

, The variety of boating wax you use will vary, depending on the style and the surface of your boat's gelcoat. Keeping gelcoat coated with wax can help the gelcoat maintain its shine for a long time, offering a protective buffer between the coat and the water.Collinite 885 is a commonly used and recommended boating wax, used also in surfing and for other purposes.

, As with polishing and compounding, you can apply wax by hand or with an electric buffer. Use the same circular motion to avoid streaking.


Different varieties of wax may come with specific directions, so defer to the product that you buy.

, Regardless of whether you use an electric buffer or a hand buffer, work by hand around non-removable fittings to keep the buffer from catching on or damaging them. Do the same in tight crevices.


Remove fittings ahead of time if possible, keeping the screws with the fixtures closely, so you won't get confused later.

, After a small amount of time, the wax should start to look somewhat hazy, which means you're ready for a second buffing. It's important to allow the wax enough time to set, so it'll be able to protect the gelcoat. This should only take 5-10 minutes in the sun.

, Use a soft towel or terrycloth bonnet if you decide to use an electric polisher, or a clean hand buffer and work in circles. The shine should really start to pop as you buff away the cloudiness of the wax.

Make reservations.,
Try to plan your route in advance for longer trips.,
Hire a captain or captain the boat yourself.,
If you're considering a ""bareboat"" charter, especially in saltwater, where you are the captain, you must meet basic standards the companies set for experience and competence on the size and type of boat you'd like to charter.,
Review boat safety procedures.",How to Rent a Boat," Boat rentals come in a variety of forms, from hourly and daily rentals to weeks-long charters. Rental operations may not offer a wide range of boat models, but they can provide a range of boat types for you to try. Rental fleets tend toward basic models, nevertheless, they can give you and your family a sample of the boating fun waiting for you on the water, and they are a great way to get your feet wet.;
, You may have no problem reserving a rental boat but if you are renting in peak season, reservations may be necessary to ensure the boat you want will be available for you.

, You can find most charts online and it will help if you have a working knowledge of the body of water before hand.

, Most boats are relatively simple to operate, although state regulations regarding powerboat operator licensing and certification may apply. A dock attendant will provide brief boating instructions to you before you set out. Consult your state Department of Natural Resources for listings of rental operations. If you are not comfortable driving the boat yourself, most rental facilities will either provide you with a captain (charter) or recommend one for you.

, Consult the company you're considering chartering from for policies.

, Especially if you have children on board. You should always have an emergency float plan.

You also want a buyer to be able to imagine his own gear on the boat, to really make it his own. Leaving your own things in the boat will add clutter and make it hard for the buyer to imagine the boat as his own., Be thorough and scrub every inch of your watercraft before you try to sell it. A dirty boat might turn off potential buyers, and even if the buyer is still interested it will be difficult to get your asking price. Try to make your boat look brand new, and your potential buyers will be impressed.Clean any carpets and upholstery on your boat. Nothing makes a boat look worse than shabby floors and seating.Wipe down the cabinets, lockers, and every other storage area onboard your boat., If you let a professional take a look at the boat, he can tell you about any repairs that the boat may need in the near future. Making those repairs in advance can help you get a better price for your boat. However, some boat brokers recommend holding off on replacing electronics, as sellers typically don't get a very big return on electronics upgrades., If your boat's coat is faded or scratched, it may need some minor touch ups, or even a whole new coat. Pay special attention to the bottom (if it's painted) and the outboard and stern drive skegs.If painting the hull, stick with basic boat hull colors like white or dark-blue. Buyers don't want any funky surprises when they see the boat's colors., No one wants to buy a rusty boat. Even if it's just a few minor spots, treating the rust beforehand can make your boat much more appealing to potential buyers.Use a spray-on rust converter to treat the rust. Apply a coat of paint over any rusted areas that need to be painted., You'll want the coat to look sleek and waxed when you take pictures and show the boat to interested parties. Some boaters recommend using spray-on furniture wax for a short time shine, but you can also buy wax that's made for boats that will stay on longer and look sleeker., Even a clean boat can start to smell a little stale if the windows and hatch are shut for a few days. Open things up and let the cabin air out. If an interested party comes to view your boat in person, he'll notice the difference., Before a potential buyer comes to see the boat, have all your paperwork in order. Keep the title, registration, warranty (if you have one), and any recent service/repair receipts in a single place, like a folder or binder. It will make things easier for you if the interested party decides to buy your boat, and it will make you look like an organized, responsible seller., In some places, the local or regional government requires all boat sellers to prepare a bill of sale for the buyer. Some laws even require the bill of sale to be notarized. This helps the buyer prove his ownership, and lets him have a record of the transaction in case he needs it in the future. Find out what your local and regional requirements are regarding a boat's transfer of ownership., In many places, the seller is required by law to notify his local authorities, in the Department of Licensing, Department of Wildlife, or other outdoor recreation-related agency, of any boat's sale or transfer of ownership. Some laws require swift notification, giving the seller as few as five days to notify the proper agencies about the boat's transfer of ownership. Find out in advance which agency or agencies you're required to notify, and obtain all the necessary paperwork in advance to help expedite the process., There are many, many websites that allow sellers to connect with potential buyers online. A website like Craigslist allows you to advertise to a broader range of people, but a specialty site like Boat Trader, for example, may help you reach a more targeted audience who know more about boats and are willing to pay more money for certain features.

, Boat listings with photographs included are always viewed more than listings without any pictures.Be thorough when photographing the boat. Try to give potential buyers a digital tour of the boat: include multiple views and different angles of the front, sides, back, deck, and cabin.Don't include anything that won't come with the boat in the photographs. For this reason (and for general appearances), it's best to remove any clutter from your boat and from the area around your boat where you'll be photographing. If your boat is parked on a trailer in your yard, mention in the add whether or not the trailer is included, or if it's for sale at an additional price. Failure to mention these specifics, or failure to remove items from the boat that aren't included, could be construed as a misrepresentation by potential buyers.Show your boat in action. If possible, have someone take a photograph of your boat cruising away from the dock. This gives a potential buyer some idea of how well the boat performs, and lets that buyer imagine the boat as something he or she could drive.Capture your boat's best angles. Look at some professional boat listings online and take note of what angles the professional sellers shoot from when photographing their boats. This may take a bit of research and some experimentation on your end, but in the end you will have your own stunning, professional-quality photographs to help sell your boat.Help illustrate size and dimensions. You don't need to use a boat load of gear for this, as that will only clutter up the photograph. But you can, for example, have someone take a photograph of you extending measuring tape inside the cabinets or storage areas, or across the inside cabin, to help potential buyers see what your boat's real dimensions are.Capture your boat's finer details. Offer close-up shots of any parts of your boat that you think might help persuade potential buyers, such as the boat's motor or the controls around the steering wheel.Make sure the lighting is right (but not so bright that it's blinding). Try taking photographs with the sun behind you, rather than staring into the sun, as this will only silhouette your boat and could cast unwanted gleams of light off of your boat. If you can, try photographing your boat on a slightly cloudy day, as this will ensure that the sky will still light up your boat but the sun won't create an annoying glare.Some websites have specific requirements for the size and file type of photographs. Boat Trader, for example, requires photographs to be .jpg files less than 100K in size.Know what the specific requirements are for any sites you intend to advertise your boat on.

, Chances are an educated boat buyer will want to know details like the overall size of the boat, the engine hours, and details about the motor (if it has one). Having that information up front, and including it in your advertisement, will help you secure a sale faster and with greater ease.


Include a thorough history of the boat. Mention in the advertisement any repairs, upgrades, and general maintenance you've put into the watercraft. If you bought it used, include what you know about the previous owner's maintenance and repairs., You'll want to do your research in advance to know what the going rate is for a boat that's as old and has as much wear and tear as your boat. You should also determine your absolute bottom price beforehand as well.The NADA, BUC, and ABOS pricing guides are a good place to start, but you should also check the prices of similar boats for sale at your local boat dealers, in classified ads, and online.


Know whether you're willing to hold out for the right price. It could take time to find someone willing to pay your top asking price, which means time that you'll be paying for for storage and continued maintenance.You may need to be flexible on the asking price. Some experts recommend pricing a boat at least five percent cheaper than the lowest-priced boat of your boat's make and age to ensure a speedy sale.Don't let potential buyers know what your bottom price is before they've seen the boat. If an interested party calls you on the phone or emails you and asks how low you're willing to go, tell him you'd like him to see the boat before he starts trying to negotiate a better price. If you've done your work cleaning, prepping, and polishing the boat, it should speak for itself.As you collect prices for comparable boats, save copies of this info to show potential buyers.
Ultimately, the price is up to you. You'll need to decide how much time and effort you're willing to put into making a sale.

, Interested parties will almost certainly ask you why you're selling the boat. They may be making conversation, or they may be trying to test you to see if there are any problems with the boat. Boating experts generally recommend telling interested parties that you're looking for a change in lifestyle: a different boat, a bigger boat, or even a smaller boat are all common reasons why someone might sell a boat. You don't need to lie to sellers, just know in advance what to say so you're not caught off guard if they do ask., Sometimes when you're selling something online, you'll get a lot of nibbles before anyone commits to an actual purchase. Whether they're just feeling out the water, so to speak, or they find something better along the way, anticipate that some of the interested parties will back out or completely flake out of the deal before they've even seen the boat., Some interested parties may wish to take the boat out for a ride-along before committing to a final sale. If this won't be possible for any reason, let the interested party know. If you can arrange to take the boat out with the potential buyer, limit how many people come along (ideally just the buyer and his or her partner, if it's a couple). This will help ensure that the boat rides smoother and faster, and it will help the boat feel less cramped if there are only one or two people with you.If an interested party has asked in advance about taking the boat out, get there early and start the engine to let it warm up for a half hour to an hour. This will help get the engine ready and will let you know if there are any problems, like a dead battery, before the buyer shows up., Some sellers are wary of checks (even banker's checks), as there's no guarantee that the money will be there when you try to cash the check. Getting cash in-hand, and counting that cash before the seller leaves, is the only way to be 100% certain that you'll get money from the buyer."
"
Resist the impulse to simply call your current insurance provider and purchase boat insurance from them.,
Decide whether you want an Actual Cash Value policy, or an Agreed Amount policy.,
Identify what coverage you need.,
Shop around to get quotes on policies that meet your needs.,
Pick the quote that gives you the best coverage for your money from your short list of quality providers and get out there and enjoy the water!

",How to Shop for Boat Insurance," Many general insurance providers lack the experience with boats to make sure you get all the coverage you need. While you may ultimately find that you go with your original provider, you need to do some additional work to be an informed consumer.;
,


Actual Cash Value policies pay for Replacement Costs *minus depreciation* at the time of the loss. If your boat is a complete loss, the insurance company will take used boat pricing guides and other resources to figure approximate market value of your vessel. While this form of boat insurance costs less, you also get a smaller return. Unless you think you can replace your boat for whatever your used boat is worth, it may not be a good idea.
Agreed Amount Value policies refer to an agreed amount you and the insurance company have set as the value of your vessel and that's how much you would get back in the event of a loss. Agreed Amount Value policies also replace old items for new in the event of a partial loss without any deduction for depreciation.

, Some of the things you may want to cover (or may be obliged by law to cover) are:


Physical Damage Coverage- this is the bread and butter of your coverage but you want to make sure it covers your hull, engine, and trailer. It protects against vandalism, theft, lightning, windstorms, and collision
Personal Effects Coverage- This covers all your personal property on your boat such as a TV, cell phone, cameras, radios. You won't usually find this coverage from a general insurance provider.
Boat Liability- This is coverage you have to have, is required if you financed your boat, and is required by most states. This covers any damage you do to someone or their boat.
Uninsured boat owners coverage protects you from damages received from a hit and run or uninsured operator.
Medical liability coverage ambulance and hospital costs if someone injures themselves in, on, or boarding/leaving your boat
Commercial Towing coverage reimburses you if your boat stalls and needs to be towed in to port. Additionally you can get coverage for towing if your boat becomes grounded ashore.
Salvage Coverage will cover the cost of salvaging a sunken vessel, which is required on most lakes/rivers
Spillage Coverage covers clean-up costs for oil/fuel spills in the water.

, The easiest thing is to start with a Google search ""boat insurance specialists"" and get a quote from the top ten providers. You'll want to do a back round check on these providers to make sure they are stable, quality insurers. Do this by seeing how long they've been in business. Search for any negative reviews existing online, and finally when you talk to them make sure their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

Assess the boat's condition.,
Decide whether to repair the boat or sell it as is.,
Clean the boat thoroughly.,
Take flattering photographs of your boat.,
Determine a price.,
List your boat on online sites.",How to Sell a Used Boat,"


Determine if the boat operates. Start up the motor (if it's a motorized boat) and make sure it floats. The standard of used boats range dramatically. Some used boats are sold in perfect condition; others hardly run at all. Selling a used boat that is in working condition is much easier than selling a poor-quality boat.
Check for surface damage. A boat can run just fine but be plagued with dents and scratches from use. Some of the superficial issues can be fixed prior to sale, but it's important to get a full account of the boat's problems.





;
,


Hire a professional to perform boat repairs or fix minor damage yourself. If the damage is extensive, you might not want to put too much money into repairs before you have found a buyer. Otherwise, you might end up paying more money to repair the boat then you will make off its sale.

,


Scrub the boat from bow to stern. If there is considerable grime, you might consider renting a power washer. A brand new boat would be hard to sell if it were dirty, so cleaning your used boat until it shines is key to selling it.

,


Snap photos from all angles for buyers who aren't located near you. The more photos and the higher quality of photos you have of your boat, the more likely you are to attract a buyer.

,


Browse the Internet for similar used boats being sold.






Use the official NADA guide (http://www.nadaguides.com/Boats?nozip=1&nopop=1) for another price quote.
Have your boat appraised by a professional to discover its worth.

,


Write a detailed description of the boat that contains the following information: when the boat was purchased, special features on the boat, when extra features were installed, price paid for the boat new and price for the special features, any and all maintenance records.
Use proper spelling and grammar when writing your description.
List the boat on multiple sites, including sites specifically for used boats and sites for the selling of all items (eBay, Craigslist).

Understand the duties of a flight dispatcher before you decide to pursue this career.,
Locate an FAA-approved flight dispatcher training school.,
Apply to the program of your choice and enroll in courses where you'll learn about flight planning, navigation systems, fuel requirements, plotting charts, and other necessary skills required for the job.,
Prepare strenuously for the FAA required aircraft dispatcher certification exam by studying and taking advantage of any practice exams administered by the school in which you are enrolled.

,
Pass the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher (ADX) certification exam to qualify for employment as a flight dispatcher.,
Apply for jobs as flight dispatcher with various airlines.

",How to Become a Flight Dispatcher," A flight dispatcher is responsible for ensuring that safety guidelines are followed during a flight, knowing what weather patterns to expect and how to work around them, determining how much fuel will be needed for a flight, and many other things. This is an important position and comes with a great deal of responsibility, so do some research and educate yourself on what being a flight dispatcher entails.;
, A comprehensive list can be found at the FAA's website.


Although no more than a high school diploma is necessary to enroll in an FAA-approved flight dispatcher certification course, a college background in air transportation or meteorology is beneficial to prospective students.

,


Be aware that training programs are rigorous and intense. They generally last 5 to 6 weeks and comprise 200 hours of training. Some programs are residential while others can be taken part-time. Night classes are generally not an option, so be aware of this if you plan to stay at your present job while training.
a. Be aware that course tuition at training schools can often be costly, often ranging from $4000 USD to $5000 USD. Financial aid is available at some institutions. Exams can cost several hundred dollars, but most schools include the price of exams in their overall tuition. The exams are administered by your school at the end of the 5 to 6 week training program.

,,


The test is comprised of 80 questions which you must complete in 3 hours.
The test includes assessment in 6 basic areas in the oral/practical portion: flight planning, pre-flight and takeoff procedures, in-flight procedures, landing procedures, post-flight procedures, and emergency procedures.

Look at the cost.,
Ask yourself what you are going to use the boat for.,
Decide where you will use your boat.,
Look at your passengers and riders.,
Consider your boat length.,
Decide on your method of propulsion.,
Choose between new and used.",How to Pick a Boat," This is the first thing to consider about a boat. Typically, people buy their 'dream boat' and soon realize how much more it will cost them on a monthly and an annual basis. The simple rule of thumb is regardless of how old your boat or personal watercraft is, you should expect to pay 10-15% of the replacement value per year. Yes, this means if you buy a boat for $10,000, but it's replacement value is $50,000 you can generally expect to pay between $5,000 and $7,500 per year in maintenance and slip fees. The range is given because if you trailer your boat, you will likely spend around 10%. If it is kept in the water, you have added expenses of slip fees, hull cleaning, and every 2-3 years a bottom job (more or less recoating and repainting of the hull). This rule of 10-15% does not include fuel usage. You will also need to keep in mind boats are tremendously inefficient gas or diesel users because they push the water out of the way.;
, Now that you have determined what your future budget will allow, determine what you want to do on your boat. Most boats can be narrowed down to the following uses: Fishing (freshwater or saltwater), water sports (wakeboarding, kneeboarding, water skiing, towable), sailing (using wind to power your boat), cruising (weekender camping on the water), personal watercraft (jet skis, wave runners, etc.), and luxury yachting.

, You will also need to figure out if you will primarily be on a lake/river or on the ocean (and subsequently how far out in the ocean you plan on going). For most fishermen who fish on a lake/river, the most popular boats range from 10-20' long and are typically aluminum or fiberglass hull boats. These boats tend to have a low profile so you can 'walk' your rod around the boat unobstructed. These boats have a shallow draft (depth into the water) and produce a very small wake. People who chose boats for watersports usually chose a combination of a fish/ski boat or a straight water ski oriented boat. These boats are either U or V hull in shape and can be modified to produce a wake or little wake. These boats typically have 150-400 horsepower engines with the bulk of the power used to get the towed person 'out of the water' and riding on top of it - sport pontoons have become a popular mixed use boat over the last 20 years. The next type of boat is a sailboat. While you do not have as much of the expense of using gas or diesel on a sailboat, you will need to replace the sail every few years (which, in the long-run can be as expensive as if you did use gas). Sailboats have a weighted keel to keep the boat from tipping over. Sailing instruction is recommended for anyone who wants to pursue boat use, because you will learn not only boater safety, but how the current, wind, and theory behind boating. Cruisers are typically 25-45' in length and are considered by those who want to 'camp' the weekend. These boats usually have 1-2 staterooms (bedrooms), a bathroom, a galley (kitchen), and many of the same amenities found in a RV (recreational vehicle). PWCs (Personal Water Crafts) are usually for those who want to experience the thrill of going fast on the water. PWCs are the most dangerous of all boat vehicles because of how fast they can go and the inherent risks associated with them. As with motorcycles, PWC riders have to ride within their limits and also ride defensively as many other boaters do not see PWCs coming their way in time to avoid them. PWCs, generally speaking, have the 'least rights' when it comes to the rules of the road. Luxury yachts typically are ocean going vessels (although you will find many on larger lakes). These boats are typically not towed (as the above others usually are). These boats are made for extended cruises away from shore. These boats usually have the capacity to live aboard with various items such as a freshwater maker, generators, GPS/Radar equipment, multiple staterooms, heads (bathrooms), and galleys. The luxury yacht will typically cost you over $1 Million to buy new. You can certainly use many of the above listed boats to go out to sea, but the luxury yacht will provide comfort and security of size.

, You should next figure out how many people will typically ride on your boat (don't forget to count yourself). Boats under 28 feet (8.5 m) do have limits to the number of riders, boats over 28 feet (8.5 m) typically do not, but many have strict rules if they are coast guard regulated and if you are a licensed captain you will need to follow passenger rules.

, Usually boats under 30' can be towed by standard full-sized trucks. PWCs can be towed by cars or SUVs. Sailboats and cruisers may require special set up to tow and yachts are rarely ever towed. You will need to decide do you want a boat you want to keep in the water or one that you can transport place to place. You will also want to determine the length of the boat you want by the conditions you will use it in. For instance, a skiff or a flat bottom boat is perfect for small lakes, but would be incredibly dangerous on larger lakes with more fetch (wind caused waves). A yacht doesn't make sense on lakes (even larger ones) that freeze over in the wintertime. Boat length determines the number of passengers and conditions you can safely operate the boat in.

, There are various types of engines and placement of those engines. An outboard is mounted on to the transom (back) of the boat and usually uses a jack plate. An outboard pushes the boat forward...literally. Outboards are great for fishing and watersports. An inboard engine is usually placed 'inside' the boat either in the center or rear of the boat. The shaft and propeller are usually extended to the transom of the boat. Most cruisers and yachts have inboards. A stern drive engine is mounted directly to the transom of the boat (unlike an outboard that is more easily 'removable'). A Jet engine is an engine that cycles water through jets and pushes the water at a rate fast enough to push the boat - most PWCs and small speed boats use this water 'jet' power. Sailing is the use of wind as propulsion. And finally, human power is normally considered for paddle boats, canoes, kayaks, and such.

, Once you have determined you are comfortable with the cost, type, size, propulsion, etc. of the boat you will now need to decide if you want a new or used boat. Either way, you should remember this...you will roughly spend 10-15% of the NEW VALUE per year in maintaining your boat. Used boats can be project boats and ultimately should be bought by people who can either A) afford to have someone fix it or B) have the time to fix it themselves.

The level of education you'll need will depend on which position you're looking for. Below are some of the common airline jobs and the level of education required.


Flight attendant. Being a flight attendant typically only requires a high school diploma. If you didn't finish high school, a GED is also an acceptable level of education.Air traffic controller. This job requires either a bachelor's degree or at least 3 years of responsible work experience. Any work experience is typically applicable, as long as you can demonstrate that you performed competently.After that, you'll enter the FAA academy for education on air traffic controlling.Technicians. There are a variety of technicians who work for airlines, with different specialties. These jobs usually require at least a bachelor's degree in engineering or a related field, and might require further post-graduate work. You'll also have to pass a certification test to get a job with an airline.Pilots. Pilots need extensive education and training. You'll need at least a bachelor's degree to be eligible for the job. Of course, you'll need to know how to fly a plane, so it would help if you already have a pilot's license before starting college. They will also need to attend an FAA certified flight school for the proper training to fly commercially.;
, Some airline jobs have physical requirements. These are to ensure that planes are operated safely.


Vision requirements. Pilots, flight attendants, and air traffic controllers must have 20/20 vision, or have corrective eye wear that brings their vision to 20/20.
Height and weight requirements. Flight attendants typically must be between 5' 0"" and 6' 3"", but this varies between airlines. There is no weight requirement, but they must be able to easily walk up and down the aisles of the aircraft.Strength requirements. Flight attendants will probably have to lift bags into overhead cabins. As such, some airlines set strength requirements. Being able to lift around 70 pounds is a typical requirement.Language requirements. Most airline positions require you to speak and read English proficiently.Citizenship. All airline jobs in the US require you to be able to show proof of being able to work in US.
Medical requirements. Most airline jobs will require you to pass a medical exam to make sure you are healthy enough to perform your job.Pilots typically have to be examined every 6 months to ensure they are capable of operating a plane.Age requirements. Most airline jobs will require you to be at least 18. If your job requires you to attend the FAA Academy, you must enroll before you turn 31., Like most employers, airlines will conduct a background check on applicants. This will typically be more extensive than a normal background check. There are a number of offenses that could cause concern for airlines.Click here for a complete list of offenses that the FAA will look for when performing a background check. Either have a clean record or be prepared to explain anything that may come up on your background check.

, You'll be able to locate all kinds of airline jobs on the internet. There are numerous ways you can find them.


If you want to work for a particular airline, try checking that airline's website. There will usually be a ""Job/Employment/Career Opportunities"" tab. If you can't find anything on the homepage, try typing in the airline's name and ""Jobs"" into an internet search engine.

Airlinejobfinder.com specializes in posting airline jobs, so look here if you don't have a particular airline in mind.
Jobs are also posted on more general sites like Careerbuilder.com, so browse these sites as well.

, If you aren't finding any jobs browsing the internet, you could try contacting airlines directly. Sometimes, there are job openings that aren't posted yet. If you're lucky, you might come across some of these by inquiring with airlines.


Try either calling or emailing the human resources department of specific airlines and inquiring about job openings.

, Whenever you're applying for a job, you'll need a resume and cover letter. In many ways, preparing these documents for an airline position is just like preparing one for any other job. There are a few things you might want to emphasize, however, depending on the job you're looking for.


Read Write a Cover Letter and Make a Resume for general tips on preparing your resume and cover letter.
For a flight attendant position, you'll want to emphasize any customer service experience you've had. Flight attendants spend most of their time helping passengers, so any experience you have working with the general public will be valuable. Examples include working as a cashier or receptionist.For any kind of technical position, you'll want to emphasize jobs and internships you've had that required electrical or engineering skills.
Always read job ads carefully, and put key words from the posting in your cover letter. For example, it's common for postings to look for ""highly motivated"" candidates. In this case, explain in your letter how you're highly motivated. This shows that you've taken the time to read the posting and put together a good cover letter. Basically, use phrases and words from the job posting to demonstrate why you're a good candidate.

, If you've done a good job on your cover letter and resume, you'll progress to the interview stage of the job. The particular interview process will vary depending on which job you're going for. A flight attendant may get the job after only a quick meeting, while a pilot will probably require several interviews and tests. It is important to follow whatever process the airline uses to interview job candidates.


Read Prepare for a Job Interview for tips on preparing for an interview.

, No matter what position you're applying for, you should always maintain a polite and professional demeanor during a job interview. Many positions in an airline -- like a pilot, technician, or air traffic controller -- are directly responsible for people's safety. Accordingly, interviewers will want to hire competent and serious individuals for jobs.Always remember to dress appropriately for the interview. Appropriate dress may vary depending on what job you're applying for. A good general rule is to dress a step up from what you would wear every day to work.Many airline positions, including flight attendants and pilots, will require you to interact with airline customers. As such, you should always maintain a friendly demeanor to demonstrate that you're the right candidate.
There really is no way to anticipate the types of questions you'll get during an interview. Generally, you should be prepared to talk about your strengths and have a few stories ready to tell that demonstrate your competence and/or responsibility."

Some days might be spent entirely in a classroom, while others could be spent in an aircraft cabin simulator practicing actual procedures for dealing with in-flight emergencies.You should expect to participate in a range of educational situations that will challenge you in different ways. Some example topics include:


Medical emergency response/first aid. This will likely involve a combination of in-class and hands-on training. You will need to know what to do if a passenger needs assistance of this kind during a flight.
Airplane evacuation procedures. Some cabin simulators are built with large pools next to them so water landing and evacuation procedures can be practiced. This kind of training will be all hands-on and will require that you perform the actual duties you would for the real event.
Theory of flight and plane aerodynamics. Since this is a theory-based subject, you will probably learn about it in the classroom without much physical demonstration. This is the kind of learning you would expect in a more traditional educational setting.
You could also be expected to demonstrate how you would handle an unexpected situation in a cabin simulator with several other flight attendants and involving actors playing passengers. These training exercises are intended to test your problem-solving and group interaction abilities.;
, If you are late to your flight attendant training sessions, you will feel distracted and unprepared for class. This will also be distracting to your fellow trainees and the instructor. Punctuality is a top requirement of flight attendants on the job, so it's best to get in the habit of being early or on time now.Your training program serves the additional purpose of being an extended interview. You will be constantly judged on everything you say and do during training, and you need to be able to impress your instructors. You are almost guaranteed to not be hired if you can't be punctual.
You are sure to perform better and absorb the material more effectively if you are in your seat (or at your assigned location, as the case may be) and ready to learn when class begins.

, Becoming acquainted with your trainers at the start of the program will ensure that they know you by name and will make you feel more comfortable with the training process. Since you will be interacting so closely with your classmates for so long (up to 2 months), you have the opportunity to initiate long-term friendships or (at a minimum) form study groups to help you pass your training exam(s).If your training is not being held near where you live, you will be staying in a hotel and probably rooming with another flight attendant trainee. You will have lots of opportunities to get to know your roommate well, and it is in your best interest to be friendly and courteous toward her.
Training is a grueling and stressful process. You should remain open to the idea of bonding with your fellow trainees and supporting each other throughout the program.
Flight attending is a people-oriented career. You should get into the habit of being friendly and talkative with people you meet, since you will have to do this in your daily line of work.

, You will be given a lot of information during training, much of which you will have to commit to memory for your flight attendant exam at the end of the program. Be sure to take notes on everything you can (even during your practical, hands-on training sessions) so you can study them again later. Much of what you learn will not be available in written format for you to read at another time, so don't count on that possibility.Be sure to have extra notepads and writing utensils with you while in class/training. You wouldn't want to run out in the middle of the day and have to ask someone else to borrow some. Your preparedness will also be judged heavily by your instructors.
Taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your instructor says. Focus on understanding what you are being told and taking notes that will allow you to remember the key points. You'll especially want to make note of any specific safety protocols you will be expected to know (or at least where they can be found in detailed written form).

, Flight attendant training days can be long (up to 12 hours!), so it is important to focus on other things (or nothing at all) every now and then.Even though you will need to devote almost all your ""free"" time to training and studying, you should not forget to take breaks when possible.Late night laps in the hotel pool, 10 minute TV breaks, or early morning jogs/workouts can be very effective at recharging your mind and relieving stress.You are likely to study more effectively if you don't try to slog through 4 straight hours of reviewing notes. Take a break every hour or two (even if it's only for a few minutes) to relax or do something else.
Since your training involves carrying out procedures as well as knowing airline policies and regulations, mix up your study sessions so you alternate between book/note learning and going through the motions of more physical tasks.
Enlist your roommate or other fellow trainees to help motivate you to balance your studies with leisure activities once in a while. If you make a plan to go for a run with a classmate in the morning, you're more likely to keep the appointment than if you have no one else to hold you accountable.

, Training days will be long and exhausting, and your brain will likely be fried by the time you get back to your hotel each evening. Don't try to study when you are tired -- you won't learn much and will only wake up feeling groggy the next morning (especially if you sacrifice sleep). This will be especially problematic if you are surprised with a quiz on something you learned earlier in the week.


Go to bed early enough to wake up a few hours before training begins. Use this time in the morning to review your notes from the day before while your mind is rested. This strategy will help you retain the information as well as possible.If you have a hard time waking up early, you can find an alternative study time that works for you. Just keep in mind that late-night studying carries the risk of making you tired for your next day of training.
Don't bank on your ability to use days off to catch up on studying. Depending on your training program, you may be required to participate in weekend ride-alongs or demonstrations that could take all day.

, You will have to commit a lot of information to memory, such as Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and potentially hundreds of airport codes.You should get in the habit of creating quizzes for yourself in order to test your comprehension and retention of the material you are learning. You may find it helpful to do this with a fellow trainee.


Flashcards are a great way to memorize lots of information and are especially useful when studying without a partner. Create flashcards for terms and their definitions, airport codes, or any other short bits of information you need to know.Make a note of the topics or definitions you have trouble remembering and set aside extra time to focus on these. This is a great benefit of quizzing yourself: you will identify your areas of weakness before being officially tested on them!

, Airlines differ as to the style of the training program's final exam; your exam could include written and oral components and might even involve simulated flight scenarios. In any case, the final exam passing requirement is usually set very high (around 90%).Some airlines will not allow you to retake the final exam, so you will have to pass it on the first try. Do not fail to study for your final exam, because a few small mistakes could end up making your training essentially worthless.
If you do not know the format of the final examination, find an appropriate time and situation to ask one of your instructors. They may choose to keep this information secret, in which case you should prepare yourself for all possible exam formats.
If your exam will involve a simulated flight practical, you will find it especially useful to study with a group. This way, your study partners can play other roles in the scenario (such as an unruly passenger) and evaluate your performance.
You will have a broad range of topics to know for your exam, many of which are required in order for the training program to be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified.These topics will likely include CPR and first aid, aerodynamics and theory of flight, air traffic control principles, airplane evacuation procedures, FAA emergency protocols, in-flight announcements, helping disabled passengers, and many more., Unless you are studying with a group, pick a spot in your hotel (such as a meeting room or ""business center,"" if this is an option) where you are unlikely to be disturbed. If you study in your room, make sure you are not watching TV, talking to your roommate, using your phone, etc. while you are supposed to be focusing on your work. If you have trouble focusing at your hotel, go to a coffee shop or other public place nearby.If you have trouble reading with noise, make sure you go somewhere quiet to do your reading.
If you choose to study away from your hotel, pick a location that is easy to get to and that has hours of operation that will accommodate your schedule.
Feel free to switch up your study locations if need be. Some nights, studying in your hotel room might work fine, but on others, perhaps there is too much going on. It can also be nice to get a change of scenery now and then.

, Even if you are accepted to and pass a training program for a specific airline, you are not guaranteed a position with that airline. This is a preliminary step in the process of securing a job as a flight attendant.If you sign a contract of conditional employment when you are accepted into an airline's flight attendant training program, then you are guaranteed a position if you pass your training course.
If you wish, you can take a course on general airline procedures from an outside company before applying to an airline training program to improve your chance of success. These courses cover general procedures that apply to all airlines and airports; this may include airport codes, airline terminology, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations, First Aid, and CPR. These classes are not a substitute for airline-specific training programs.

, The exact duration of your training will depend on the airline, but most are over a month long and very intense. Training programs are conducted on location, so you will have live away from home for its duration unless you happen to already live near the training facility.You will stay in a hotel paid for by the airline and which is also likely to provide breakfasts and dinners at no cost to you.
Training days are very long (up to 12 hours), so don't expect to have much free time during training. Although you will have days off, you will probably want to use that time to study.
Some airlines pay their trainees, but this is uncommon. It is safer to expect to receive no income during training.

, Your potential employer will send you a packet with lots of information a few weeks prior to the start of training. This packet might include a list of things you need to already know by the time you start training. Typically, training will be 95% procedures and safety. Here are a few things you should plan to learn (or at least introduce yourself to) before training:Airport codes. You may be tested on your knowledge of these as soon as your very first day of training, and you'll need to know a lot of them. Quiz yourself on them often until you have committed a large portion of them to memory.
Your airline's dress code. Most airlines have extremely specific rules about flight attendant attire. You should plan to know what you can and can't wear as a flight attendant, and dress accordingly during training.
Your airline's grooming guidelines. This can include anything from makeup dos and don'ts to required and prohibited hairstyles, to facial hair rules for men (which are most likely that you can't have any).

, Although there are many good flight attendant training programs out there that are not affiliated with an airline, this alone is not sufficient to secure a flight attendant job with an airline. If you complete a general training program on your own time, be aware that you will have to repeat the process with your new employer if you are selected.Think of generalized training as a good way to boost your likelihood of doing well in your next training course. By doing this, you won't be going into the second class without any experience or knowledge. However, don't expect this to be an advantage in getting selected for training in the first place.
Airline training programs are only good for a specific type of aircraft. If you are hired by your airline and later assigned to different aircraft, you will have to undergo training for that specific type of plane.
If you train or have experience for one company in a specific plane and later switch airlines, you will have to re-train even if you'll be working on the exact same model of aircraft.

, Be sure to consider what you might need during your several-week training program in order to make your training period as comfortable and stress-free as possible. You will likely be away from home for the entire training period, so a little planning will go a long way. Although you may get a list of suggested items to bring to training in your introductory packet, it may not be totally comprehensive.Bring plenty of school supplies, such as notebooks/paper, spare writing utensils, a book bag, etc. Although flight attendant training can be unconventional in some ways, you are still a student and you will need to study like one.
Plan for the climate you are traveling to. Your training may be held in a place very different from your hometown, so consider the typical weather there during the time of year you will be training. If you are from Las Vegas and your training is in Chicago in December, you'll need to prepare for much colder, wetter weather than you are used to.
Consider your comfort during training. Although you will be limited by the airline company in terms of how you are allowed to dress, do not bring clothing or shoes that you can't be comfortable in for 12 hours at a time.

Pack enough of all the essentials you will need to make it through an extended trip while maintaining a professional appearance.,
Socialize within reason.,
Fine-tune your study skills, and always be prepared to pay close attention and take detailed notes.,
Treat others in the manner in which you think your airline management would expect of its employees.",How to Survive Flight Attendant Training,"


Unless otherwise specified in your correspondence from the airline, bring business attire for classroom and training sessions. Bring business-casual attire for down time. Some airlines may provide you with a uniform during training, so you won't need to pack as many of your own clothes.
Bring anything that will help you have more comfortable and restful sleep, like an eye mask, your own pillow and calming music. Training sessions are intense, and it is important to be well-rested.;
,


You will likely have at least 1 roommate, and you will also meet many new colleagues during training sessions. Get to know these people, as they will provide support throughout the overall experience, and you may be able to arrange group study sessions for exams. They are also the starting point for your professional network.
Some colleagues may act like they are on an extended vacation instead of a business trip. They may stay out late or drink heavily. Try to avoid getting in the habit of joining them. It is important to be able to perform your best during training and testing, so you should always be well-rested and sober. Since flight attendants are not allowed to be under the influence of alcohol on the job, many airlines institute a no-alcohol policy during training that extends to business hours and down time.

,


You will learn aircraft specifications, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines and safety procedures. Much of what you are trained on is not common knowledge, so it is essential to pay attention and take notes so you can study properly. Some airlines give daily tests during training, so take advantage of every possible opportunity to review your notes, and always ask questions if something isn't clear during training.

,


Trainers, fellow trainees, passengers and crew onboard your training flights, and anyone else you come in contact with, should be treated with patience, respect and courtesy. The only exception is when someone is putting themselves or others in danger, in which case you should act according to your airline's emergency guidelines.

You will also need over a year of practical experience, so you realistically might not be able to apply until you are over 18., You also need to be able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language. However, if you live outside the United States, then the FAA may waive the English language requirement.If waived, your certificate will only be valid outside the United States.

, They must be at least 18 years old and pass the same types of tests. In addition, non-citizens must meet the following requirements:Demonstrate that you need a mechanic certificate in order to maintain civil aircraft that is registered in the U.S.
Show that you are not a U.S. citizen or a resident alien in the U.S.
Get a detailed statement from your employer explaining what specific types of maintenance you perform on each aircraft and the length of time you have performed it.
Get a letter from the airworthiness authority in the country where you got experience, or get a letter from the advisor of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICA) which validates your maintenance experience.
Pay a fee for document review.
Show the examiner your passport.

, You can search a database on the FAA website to find schools. You can search by city, state, and country.Once you have located a nearby school, you should contact them and ask for information.


You usually need a high school diploma or General Education Diploma (GED) in order to get into most schools.
School usually lasts from 12-24 months.Graduates usually get higher starting salaries than those who don’t graduate from a technical school, so you should seriously consider attending.

, If you don’t want to go to a technical school, you can get 18 months of practical experience with airframes. If you want a power plant certificate as well, then you could get 30 months of experience that covers both airframes and power plants.Many people get their practical experience with on-the-job training in the military, though you can also get civilian on-the-job training., You should get pay receipts and a log book signed by your supervising mechanic. You should also get a notarized statement from your employer as to your experience.


If you get military experience, then you can count only the time you got working in the specialty (not training for it). You should obtain an official letter from your military employer certifying your length of service, as well as the amount of time you worked in each specialty. The letter should also state the make and model of the aircraft or engine on which you got practical experience and where you got that experience.

, If you are relying on practical experience, then you will have to interview with the FAA Airworthiness inspector. This person will review your paperwork and credit your work experience after a satisfactory interview., You need to take three different tests in order to qualify as an aircraft mechanic. There are oral, practical, and written exams., A Designated Mechanic Examiner will administer the oral and practical tests. You can get a list of examiners from your local FAA office. The tests last for about eight hours and cover 43 different technical subjects., You can register by showing your proof of experience to an FAA inspector at the local FAA office. There are different tests for airframe and power plant mechanic certificates and a general test that covers both. Based on your experience, the FAA inspector will decide if you meet the requirements to take one of the tests.You will then register an appointment to take the test at a computer testing facility, which are located worldwide. The FAA has a list of testing centers at their website.To register, you will need to have an acceptable form of identification, which should include a recent photograph, signature, and actual residential address. For example, you could use a drivers’ license, passport, or military identification card., You can get sample questions for the general, airframe, and power plant tests. The sample questions are available in PDF format at the FAA website., You must take and pass all three exams in a 24-month period. After passing, FAA will issue your certificate to you.


If you fail a test, then you have to wait 30 days before taking it again. However, you can take it earlier if you give a letter to the Examiner stating that you have gained additional training in the area you failed."

If you are boarding a small, off-peak flight, try asking the ground crew before the flight for a quick peek into the cockpit.,
Try to ask a member of the cabin crew or cockpit while on the ground.,
When boarding the aircraft, have a look toward the cockpit.,
If you once again miss the opportunity, wait until the flight has landed.,
You're in!",How to Visit the Cockpit of an Airliner," Beware that this is highly unlikely and that your best bet is probably on boarding or disembarkation.;
, Once again, this may be a struggle during busy flights.

, If a member of the cabin crew or cockpit crew notices that you would like to visit the cockpit and invites you over, then hooray! If not, continue reading.

, Try to be one of the last to disembark. As you leave the jet, ask a member of the cockpit crew to see the cockpit. Given how busy the cockpit crew are before a flight, you're far more likely to be accepted after landing.

, If you do manage to be allowed into the cockpit, have a chat with the pilots and ask to take pictures/videos, to retain this memory.

Get a good case.,
Some people feel that scopes should be dismounted before travel.,
Use a NON-TSA approved lock.,
For guns, the first step on arriving at the airport is to proceed directly to the baggage check-in -- you cannot use curb-side check-in.,
The attendant will ask for a declaration that the gun is unloaded.,
Ammunition can be packed separately in your checked luggage or in the same case as the gun (as long as it is .75 caliber or less, that is).,
The TSA inspection is usually pretty cursory.,
Once the inspection is complete, close and lock the case and put away your key.",How to Travel on Airplanes With a Gun1," The best cases are those made by Pelican, Starlight, and similar companies. These cases are tough! Supposedly a tank can roll over them without damage to the contents. TSA and airline baggage handling is rough on cases, so the best case is a requirement. The typical Walmart case simply will not do.


The best cases have foam linings that can be cut to fit your gun(s). In many cases, you must make cutouts since the guns will not fit without cutting. Do not cut openings for ammunition -- even for car travel it is often illegal to have ammunition packed with the weapon. You can provide for magazines and other gear, though.
Pistols can be packed inside of regular luggage. Since theft of any gun is a consideration, having a case that does not resemble a gun case can be an advantage. Obviously, having your pistols enclosed in regular luggage provides this obfuscation. Some people pack rifles in golf club travel containers. The Pelican-like cases are not as obviously ""gun"" cases as these are also used for demonstration equipment, tools, and instruments.;
, With cases such as suggested with very thick foam, this is probably not required but is a simple step that may prevent problems.

, While many will tell you to use a TSA approved lock, this is actually prohibited by 49CFR 1540.111, the regulation that governs firearm transportation. It should be noted that the TSA usually allows the use of TSA locks but in reality they are not legal as they are designed to be opened by a TSA master key, which is expressly prohibited by the above regulation. The TSA will ask you to unlock the case or provide them a key (do not give them the combination if a combination lock is used), then they will visually inspect the packing of your gun, after which they will either have you re-lock your case or they will re-lock it and return your key. TSA agents are not trained or allowed to handle firearm, so no contact should me made in that manner. If an agent feels the firearm requires in-depth inspection, they must have a law enforcement officer come over to perform that function. If re-inspection is deemed necessary after the bag is checked, they will locate the owner and have them open the case again, so it is wise to remain in the area or on the aircraft after checking the firearm. Buy the best non-TSA locks you can find.

, Declare to the attendant when you get to the counter, ""I have a gun to check."" (Note, airgun/air rifle/air pistol are not considered firearms and do not require declaration but do have to be placed in checked baggage and it is wise to alert the agent as to avoid a delay due to a misunderstanding.) Air tanks are not allowed past TSA without internal inspection. That said, a tank attached to a gun is considered to be part of the gun and not a tank. Thus, limit yourself to one attached tank -- if you must have additional tanks, either prepare them for internal inspection (X-Ray is not enough, unfortunately) or ship them separately. Just-in-case, it is a good idea to travel with the tools to allow internal inspection of an airgun tank. The tanks should all have air pressure released before inspection or take the tool to release the pressure if necessary. There is no danger of explosion from travel.

, There is a form you fill-out with this declaration that goes into the gun case. You will get a baggage tag for you gun and other luggage. Your gun will be sent to the TSA inspector for the next stage of processing.

, There are state restrictions on having ammo packed with the gun that may apply, too! There are usually airline limits on how much ammunition that can be carried, typically 5 kilograms (11 pounds) per person. Check with the airline for these limits. Again, you can always ship ammunition separately. While it is relatively easy to ship ammunition, shipping guns is not simple.

, As stated above, they are only allowed to visually inspect the firearms packing and the content of the case. They are allowed to search the case in depth which may require manipulating the firearm somewhat along with the packing, but no manipulation of the firearm in terms of opening the action, removing parts or magazines or dis-assembly of any type. If this is deemed necessary by the agent, they must have a law enforcement officer come to the area and perform that action. While unlikely, you may be asked to explain your reasons for travelling with a gun. If so, be nice. A short and simple answer is all that is needed. Something like ""protection while on my trip,"" ""hunting,"" or ""attending a shooting event"". Most likely nothing will be asked. The most I have encountered to date have been statements of positive admiration for my firearms by the inspecting agents.

, Your gun should then become ""luggage"" except for possibly being routed to special handling upon arrival at your destination. While the airline may tell you that your guns will arrive in a different area than you baggage (think skis), in practice they will often just be luggage and arrive with your other bags. Ask the agent where to expect them if not informed and immediately check with the staff at the arriving airport as well but be ready to check both special handling and regular baggage arrivals.

In addition to the above, for international travel you must obtain the rules and regulations for US Customs and the country (countries?),
If possible, plan your travel with direct flights.,
Get all necessary forms from the host country early.,
Get a US Customs form 4457 signed in-person by a Customs officer prior to leaving.",How to Travel on Airplanes With a Gun2," you will be visiting or transiting.

, This avoids not only possible delays but lost baggage and any problems with transporting a gun through a third country.

, Also back that up with a call to the host country embassy here in the US and make sure you're not missing anything. Event organizers can often provide most of the required information for getting a rifle into their country; pistols may be far more difficult.

, This is so that you can get your gun back into the US without paying duty (especially applicable to guns made outside of the US; this also applies to cameras and other foreign-made items). Once you have this form, hang on to it as it can be reused. This can be done on departure day, but make sure you have a Customs Office available at your departure airport. Call the office directly, and do not depend on information from your airline regarding Customs availability.

Pack smart.,
Dress for comfort.,
Take some safety precautions.,
Enjoy the airport.,

Soothe the savage beast: Whatever soothes your child, such as a pacifier or stick of chewing gum, is a must-have.,
Provide tons of opportunities for playtime.,
Use the on-flight entertainment.,
Encourage sleep.",How to Travel by Plane with Children," Avoid the stress of last-minute packing! As soon as you book your flights, start making a list of what you need, at least mentally. Make a list and divide it into categories: What you'll need and what each child will need (within reason—don't forget, they have stores where you're going!).


Some first-line items include: bandages, children's pain reliever, wipes, a sippy cup, lollipops, chewing gum, change of clothes, and extra Ziploc bags for wet clothes and nausea. Hide away a few in-flight surprises (deck of cards, stickers, coloring books, new crayons).
You'll be doing a lot of lugging, so remember: less is more. You will need free hands, so consider backpacks for your carry-on bags. Older tots can ""help"" pack their carry-ons. Make sure each child can carry his or her own pack (or else it will end up on your back!).;
, Forget your Sunday best. Put yourself and your family in layered, washable, elastic-waisted, slip-on outfits.

, Plan to dress your children in bright-colored, easy-to-spot clothing. Tuck a card with name/address/cell phone info in their pockets in case they get separated from you. Take a Polaroid the day of your flight or have a very recent picture of them with you. If your toddler is a real wanderer, especially if he is not verbal, insist that he remains strapped into his stroller until you board. Think about investing in child harnesses.

, Arrive at the airport with lots of time. While you ""hurry up and wait"" before boarding, walk around the airport with your child. Watch planes, shop, people-watch. Walk up and down the stairs, jump in place, do some yoga poses or dance moves. Burn off that extra energy (and calm any preflight nerves) before you are cooped up on board.

, Airplane bathrooms are tiny. Before boarding, head for an airport bathroom. Change all diapers and disposable underwear. Put toddlers (and yourself while you're in there) on the potty, just in case. Put disposable training pants on potty-trainers just in case. Don't forget a change of clothes and an extra plastic bag.

, Many flights no longer provide meals, especially foods that will appeal to your child. Bring plenty of portable, non-messy, nut-free snacks on board such as small crackers, juice boxes, cheese sticks, and grapes. Keep yourself and your children hydrated with bottled water.

, During takeoff and landing, offer a stick of sugar-free gum, lollipop, or pacifier for sore ears. This is a good time to nurse or bottlefeed babies.

, These days, iPads and iPhones are one sure-fire way to keep kids entertained with games and videos; you may not like resorting to electronics, but on a long flight, they can be a lifesaver. Just make sure your devices are fully charged and you bring chargers with you, if there are any on-board plugs. Coloring books, stickers, quiet games (Legos, puzzles), and books are all great distractions, too. Pack small ""toy kits"" for each child in Ziploc bags so the pieces all stay together.


Throughout the flight, hold some back as surprises. Don't reveal all your cards at once, or the kids will burn through the entertainment really fast. Hold back some really enjoyable toys, books, or activities for later in the flight, when they're tired and bored.

, Many longer flights now include movies, TV shows, or even games on board through seat-back devices. Let your kid watch and enjoy! Make sure you come prepared with some headphones that fit comfortably, and let them enjoy the novelty of shows and games they don't have access to at home., Jet lag is a big part of travel, and your kids are going to be tired, no matter what, after the flight. Don't worry too much about whether they're sleeping during the ""day"" for your destination's timezone; if they're tired on board the plane, let them sleep. You can even encourage it by putting on pajamas or other comfy clothes, bringing along a favorite pillow or blanket, getting snuggled up, and playing them some soothing music; some people have even been known to use a low-dose allergy medication to help the snooze fest along. On a very long flight, you probably won't regret any moment of peace you can get!"

,
Weigh yourself.,
Pick up your piece of luggage.,
Wait for the scale to settle on a weight.,
Subtract your initial weight from the weight holding the luggage.,
Compare your luggage weight with the airline’s restrictions.",How to Weigh Luggage Before Your Flight1," Scroll to the bottom to find the general restrictions for baggage weight. Go to the airline’s website and type “baggage” into the search bar to find a complete set of baggage rules.;
,, Get on the scale and look at the weight reading below. Write down your weight.

, If your baggage is heavy and you have back problems, you may want to ask a healthier family member to do this for you. Keep the luggage in the air while you get on the scale.

, Then, write down that weight.

, This is the current weight of your packed bags. Remember that if you add anything to the luggage after this point, it will no longer be accurate.


For example, if your initial weight was 160 lbs. (72.5kg), and then you weighed yourself with your bag and it was 184 lbs. (83.5kg), then the weight of your luggage is 24 lbs. (11kg)., Remove items from the bag and repeat until you drop under the weight requirement.


Some experts report that baggage scales are often wrong. It is ok to ask the airline to reweigh the bag on another scale or reset the scale, if you weighed it at home and found it was less than the limit.It is a good idea to keep the baggage at least a lb. under the limit to avoid problems with scales.

Research your luggage allowances before you weigh your bag.,
Purchase a handheld luggage scale from a travel store or an online retailer.,
Insert the required batteries into the back of the handheld scale.,
Select whether you want to use lbs.,

Check the rear dropout shape.,
Determine your gear ratio.,
Take off unnecessary parts such as derailleurs, shifter cables, cable housings, and shifters.,
Most older road bikes have a double chain ring crank set.,
Using a freewheel remover specific to your brand of freewheel, remove your old freewheel and replace with a new single speed freewheel.,
Your rear wheel may require what is called ""re-dishing"" in order to insure that your wheel runs straight in the rear triangle.,
Using a chain tool, shorten your chain for the new ratio.

,
When installing your rear wheel ensure that the chain tension is not too tight and not too loose.",How to Turn an Old Road Bike Into a Singlespeed," Does the bike have horizontal dropouts in the back? This is necessary to be able to adjust chain slack in the final step. Alternately, you can buy some kind of doohickey to do it, but that ruins the clean look so vitally important to most conversions. What this means is, can you adjust where the back wheel goes, in a front-back direction. Some bikes have vertical dropouts, some have slanted ones. There has to be some way to adjust wheel position and chain tension. In a normal bike, the rear derailleur does this job. You could leave it on, but your little fixed gear friends will snort.;
, This is the tooth ratio of your front chain ring to your rear cog. The best way to do this is by riding around for a few days trying various combinations between your front and rear. A typical ratio is a 48 tooth chain ring on your crank set, and a 16 tooth freewheel on your rear hub. Alternatively a 52 tooth chain ring and 17 tooth freewheel works for many as well. Keep in mind that the lower your ratio (less teeth in the chain ring or more teeth in the freewheel), the better you'll climb hills, but the slower you'll be on the straightaways and vice versa.

, For a freewheel equipped single speed bike its highly recommended that you leave on both front and rear brakes. Unlike a fixed gear bicycle, a freewheel equipped single speed relies 100% on the brakes for stopping. Thus for safety you need both. With a fixed-gear bicycle, pushing back on the pedals can take the place of the rear brake and used for light braking, though at least a front brake should be fitted and used as the primary brake.

, In order to attain that ""clean"" look you should remove both and either install a new chain ring or one of the older ones (depending upon your preferred ratio.) Usually it helps to install the single chain ring on the INSIDE of the crank spider so that your ""chain line"" is straight. Pay special attention to clearance with the lower drive side chain stay if you're using a large chain ring (48 or larger) on the inside. In most cases you will need to use chain ring bolts specifically for single ring applications.

, Alternatively you can buy and install a new ""flip-flop"" wheel which would allow you both to ride single speed and fixed gear. If you have a cassette on a free hub body, you can either use the complete cassette, or for a cleaner look install a single speed cog and use spacers to make sure the chain is straight (adjust chain line).

, Sometimes you can get away without doing this, but if your wheel runs leaning to one side or the other, consider re-dishing.

,, Holding the bike up spin the cranks to make sure everything is spinning smoothly. Excessive noise, or a dropped chain means that something is wrong, most likely in the chain line.

Flip bike upside down, or put the wobbly wheel in a truing stand if you have one.,
Locate the bend in the rim by noting where the wheel comes nearer to the brakes.,
Understand how spokes are tightened and turned.,
Grip the spokes around your problem area and squeeze lightly, checking for looseness.,
Note which side each spoke pulls towards to find the ones causing your wobble.,
Tighten the spoke just below your problem area with a half-turn of the nipple.,
Loosen the two spokes next to the one you just tightened, using only quarter-turns.,
Spin the wheel and check the truing.,
Continue this 3-spoke adjustment process until the wobble is gone.,
Check for ""flat spot"" wobbles, or a bike that is not ""radially"" true.",How to Unwobble a Bicycle Rim1," You need to be able to spin the wheel freely, allowing you to see where it wobbles and make subtle changes. Usually, turning the bike upside down is more than enough, but precise mechanics can use a truing stand, which holds the wheel in place and has small calipers that let you notice even the smallest wobble.


If you've got a serious wobble or issue, it can help to take the tire off first. At the very least, take some air out of the tires. If not, one will likely pop while you work.;
, Spin the wheel, watching near the brakes to see where the wheel swings to either side. Either stop the bike at this point with your fingers, noting where it is, or use a permanent marker to measure the wobble. Simply hold the marker evenly at one height, and spin the wheel so that any wobbling are hits the marker and makes a streak.









Looking to protect your beautiful wheels from marks? Take a small piece of masking tape and use it to make the spots where there is some wobble.

, The way you tighten spokes seems a little counter-intuitive at first, since you'll be turning spokes on both the top and bottom of the wheel. It seems like it's breaking the ""righty-tighty"" rule you've grown up with, but there is an easier way to think about it. Imagine you're looking straight down at the top of the spoke where it meets the rim. If you were to take a screwdriver and stick it into the top of the spoke, you would turn the spoke clockwise, like normal, to tighten it, and counter-clockwise to loosen it. If you're ever in doubt, imagine which direction you would turn this screwdriver, and turn accordingly.

, If you're not sure what ""loose"" is, feel your other wheel or the spokes on other sides of the wheel. While not all wobbly wheels have noticeably loose spokes, most do, which will point out the exact spoke where there is an issue. If a spoke is extremely loose, tighten it until it is about the same tension as those around it.









If a spoke is extremely loose, you should still go ahead and try to fix it. That said, you may need a new rim if this happens regularly-- it should be a rare occurrence.There are rare cases where a spoke feels too tense, which can cause a wobble as well. The technique to fix it (shown below) is the exact same, just with loosening instead of tightening.

, The spokes will alternate which side of the rim they go to -- half to the left, half to the right. The balance between these two sides is what keeps your wheel true and prevents wobble. So, if your wheel wobbles to the left, that means the spokes on the right side are too loose to keep things balanced, or the spokes on the left are too tight. This is why you only get wobbles in certain areas -- one spoke that is too loose only affects the wheel in the precise spot.


Trace the spoke down from the rim down to the center of the wheel to see which side it pulls towards., The golden rule of rim truing is go slow. Using your spoke wrench, a small tool with notches made to fit perfectly around the ""nipple,"" the small sheath where the spoke meets the rim. Tighten it with a half-turn clockwise, then check again. Remember -- go slowly! This first turn won't fix the issue immediately, but don't keep turning just yet.









Don't have a spoke wrench? A pair of needle-nose pliers will work in a pinch, but you should buy a spoke wrench cheaply as soon as you can.
Remember to get the right side! If the wobble is to the left, you need to tighten the spoke that pulls the rim back to the right., This is how you keep the radial tension (up and down the rim, keeping it perfectly round) even without too much work. Say you just tightened a spoke on the right side of the rim, because it wobbled to the left. On either side of this spoke are two more spokes for the left side of the rim. Instead of continuing to crank on the right side, which can put too much pressure on one spoke, just loosen the spokes that pull it to the left. By using just a quarter turn on each spoke, you undo the same amount of tension on the left that you just added to the right, further balancing your wheel.


Keep this simple math equation in your head as you work -- ""if I tighten one spoke, I need to loosen the two spokes next to it half as much to make sure it stays balanced."" The opposite equation, loosening one spoke and then tightening the other two half as much, also applies.

, After every set of adjustments, spin the wheel and check your work. You should be keeping an eye on the wheel frequently -- don't just blindly tighten the spokes without seeing if you're making any progress.








, You may need to take another set of three spokes and do the same thing. Just remember to keep the forces even, balancing out every adjustment on both sides. Never turn more than a half-turn at a time, and only work on one set of spokes at a time, allowing your to quickly undo something if you make a mistake.


You will likely get smaller and smaller adjustments as you work -- using only turning the nipple by small increments. At this point, you should be spinning the wheel after every tightening, making only the smallest adjustments until you hit perfection., The most common issue is when the rim wobbles left to right, but bike tires can also wobble up and down as well, forming egg-shaped wheels or small flat spots where the tension isn't quite right up and down. After fixing the rim from side to side, make sure you didn't accidentally pull the wheel out of radial true as well. Usually, you'll have a few simple adjustments to make, but they should be easy."
"
Check that the bike is laterally trued first, as best as you can get it.,
Spin the rim and watch it from the side, noting any high spots using calipers or your fingers.,
Tighten the two spokes that are on either side of the rubbing area with a half turn.,
Move the calipers, pen, or your finger closer in, spin the wheel, and adjust as needed.,
Check that parts of the wheel don't dive inwards now, making flat spots, and loosen as necessary.",How to Unwobble a Bicycle Rim2," You'll always want to finish laterally truing the bike before attacking a radial wobble. Radial wobbling is when the bicycle rim loses its perfectly round shape, and you can usually feel a little bump when riding. This has more to do with the overall tension on the bike and is easier to fix once you've got side-to-side areas ironed out.

, Spin the bike and place your finger, a marker, or a set of calipers underneath the wheel, just below where it would touch the tire. Then spin the wheel and note where it rubs against the caliper. This is where the rim has elongated, and you'll need to pull it in to get this bump out of the rim., One of these spokes will go to the right side of the bike, the other to the left, so tightening them both equally will pull the high spot in without ruing your radial truing.

, Keep working these two spokes until you've pulled the rub out of the rim, using smaller and smaller are turns (like a quarter-turn) to get more precise truing.


After every set of turns, spin the wheel and double-check the lateral truing again, making sure you've not introduced a new wobble., This often happens on the opposite side of the wheel as the part you're working on, but it is an easy fix. Just find the two spokes on either side of your low spot and loosen them with quarter turns until you're even again."
"
Know when a rim is damaged and not simply out of true.,
Tighten any extra-loose spokes until they feel as tense as the rest, then make the finer adjustments.,
Make sure the wheel is seated perfectly and the brakes are even if you can't seem to true the bike.,
Replace any broken spokes as soon as you can, as one broken spoke often leads to more.",How to Unwobble a Bicycle Rim3," If your wheel can't stay in true, shows noticeable bending or denting, or your spokes won't stay tight, you'll need a new wheel. Oftentimes you'll need to true a wheel after a crash, which can loosen spokes, but it is not always possible. If you find yourself working and working without results, the rim is likely shot., The half turn, two quarter turn system won't work if the spoke is noticeably looser than the rest. Simply tighten this spoke on its own until it feels about as tight as the spokes around it, then move on to the more precise adjustments.

, Is the rim really out of true, or do you not have the wheel in the frame properly? The best way to ensure this is to release the wheel as if you were about to take it off the bike. Then squeeze the brakes to hold the bike in the center of the frame. Re-tighten the wheel into the frame and then let go of the brakes, leaving the wheel in the dead center.

, When you lose a spoke, you can keep riding for a bit if you have not other option to get home. But the increased pressure on the other spokes will warp and bend your wheel if left for too long, eventually causing more spokes to break and potentially ruining your rim permanently."

Comfort: Some airlines give out blankets and pillows, however it's not in their best interest to clean them thoroughly, so to avoid any unwanted germs take your own.,
When you're at a high altitude your ears may 'pop'!,
Entertainment: Even though you may get incredibly bored you still have to respect the other passengers, so bring headphones to keep the noise private.,
Health: It's important that you stay as healthy as possible on the plane or you will feel terrible when you get to your destination.,
Every hour or so go to the bathroom, even if you don't need to go.,
Change your watch to the time zone you will be going to.,
If you want to take a nap, try to read VERY boring stuff on newspapers you get from boarding gates, and read sections like politics.",How to Survive a Long Plane Ride," Special travel pillows can be bought from supermarkets.;
, To prevent this, you could chew gum or candy.

, iPods are great, as on some models you can play films as well as music! If you're lucky your plane may even have provided TVs for you.

, Drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated. If you are not a fan of water try a sport/energy drink. Try to stay away from alcohol. Some airlines provide food for you but don't bet on it. Pack some of your own food if you have certain requirements. However, remember to stick to the restrictions.

, Get up and walk down the aisles every hour or so. You can freshen up and also stretch your legs.

, Try to live by that time, for example, sleep if it's their nighttime. If you look at your watch regularly, the time will seem like it is going slower, so just have a nap or sink into a good book and let the time pass.

, You may eventually fall asleep by the time you finish a few paragraphs!

"
The first step to travelling by plane is the packing.,
Bring important documents.,
Try to check in online or on your phone, as this means that you have the chance to make multiple copies of boarding passes as backups and makes it a lot easier and a lot less stressful when you get to the actual airport.,
Dress appropriately for safety and security.,
Keep clothing loose but warm.,
Keep carry-on items to a minimum.,
Take your own pillow and blanket.,
Bring a few health items.,
When you are traveling overseas on a night flight, Sleep!,
Bring your own meal or snacks.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Travel by Air," Like for any holiday, only pack the things you need, and one crucial thing you should do is before flying, check the airline's baggage allowances so you get a rough idea of how much stuff you can bring. If necessary, buy a luggage scale from any store to help with an accurate measurement of how much your bags will weigh. For help with packing, read this wikiHow page: Pack for a Trip.;
, Bring your visa, passport, tickets, and other documents you may need when you are on this trip. Be sure to bring these in your carry on or pockets—not in your checked luggage! The best thing to do would be to bring your important travel documents in pockets with zips, as it reduces the chances of the documents falling out of the pockets and you having a very hard time explaining to security.


Photocopy important documents. Keep one copy of your documents with you but separate from the original. Leave another copy to a trusted friend at home. These copies will help in replacing your documents if you lose your luggage.

, Did I mention much quicker?

, Though rare, airline accidents do happen. Should it become necessary to evacuate the plane by using that inflatable slide, or worse, walking out onto the wing, the last things you want to be wearing are shorts, a tank top or spike heels. Keep it simple: cotton or other natural fiber clothing (synthetics are more flammable), long sleeves and pants, sensible shoes, preferably sneakers. If you don't wear sneakers, wear sturdy, comfortable shoes that are easy to put on and remove for security. Slip-on athletic or walking shoes are a good choice.


Keep your footwear on at all times on the plane. You'll be able to evacuate more quickly in an emergency, and it's just polite.

, Don't wear tight clothing, unless you are wearing airplane socks that specifically help with circulation. Many people swell during a flight due to the altitude and air compression and tight clothing may become uncomfortable. Air conditioning can get cold, especially sitting still for so long on a long flight, so long pants and top are ideal., Most airlines allow only two (2) carry ons nowadays, and that includes a ""personal item"", such as a purse or backpack. Pack necessities in your carry-on. This can include medications, reading materials, information pertinent to your trip, your passport if traveling outside your home country, a small travel kit (in case your luggage is lost or delayed), a snack, and anything else you feel you can't do without, such as your digital music player. Also choose a small carry-on bag that will fit into the overhead compartment and keep the already limited foot space free.

, Long flights, particularly overseas, can be almost unbearable without these essential comfort items. This doesn't mean you need to bring your bed pillow and your down comforter. Check out travel stores and websites for neck pillows and blankets that fold to the size of a DVD case. You never know who might have used the airline's pillows and blankets before you, or what their hygiene practices are -- or aren't.

, Gum may help keep your ears clear. Earplugs soften the drone of the engine. Even if you don't usually get airsick, Dramamine can be a lifesaver if you hit some rough turbulence. If you have a cold or sinus problems, take a decongestant well before you board the plane, but bring nasal spray just in case.

, You will want to eat and watch the movie, but when you get there, it may be morning depending on where you are going, and having jet lag is no fun.


To make it easier when you get to your destination, on the plane, instead of tuning into the time of the place you left, tune into the time of your destination, so you can sleep and get your body clock ready for the destination before even landing. This means that when, in your destination, it is time to sleep, you should try to sleep, or at least close your eyes.

, Many airlines have eliminated this 'frill' and the packed meals they provide for a charge are often pretty bad. Make sure you avoid liquids (drinks, soups, etc.) which might not pass security inspection and are messy to deal with. Instead, try foods like sandwiches, chips, cookies, and cut up fruits and vegetables.

, Air in airplanes is often very dry. You can take an empty water bottle through security and fill it once inside, or you can purchase a bottled drink inside security. If dry skin is a problem, you may also wish to use plenty of moisturizing lotion or cream. Avoid consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and salt, as these will dry your mouth, and just add to the dry atmosphere.

Locate the baggage claim office.,
File a written report.,
Review the laws or regulations that apply to your flight.,
Keep in contact with the airline.,
File a police report.,
Escalate your claim.",How to Take Action for Stolen Airline Luggage1," If you're still in the airport when you discover that your luggage was stolen, find the baggage claim office of the last airline you were on and report the theft immediately.Most airlines will have a baggage claim office located close to their baggage claim carousels, or along the outside walls of the airport's baggage claim area.
Even if you have no idea when your bag was stolen, you should report the theft to the last airline you were on. Let them sort out the details of where your luggage was stolen.
If you notice the theft in the airport, you should report it right then. However, if you have a situation in which items you packed were stolen from your bag, you may not discover the theft until later.
Airlines typically require you to file a report within 24 hours. For this reason, you should open your checked bags at your earliest convenience – for example, as soon as you've checked into your hotel – and evaluate the contents.
If you notice something missing after you've left the airport, call the airline's toll-free customer service number or search for a claim form on the airline's website.;
, Whether in person or over the phone, insist on completing a written report and make sure you have a copy of the report for your records. Not only will you need it for reference, but you may need to submit it to an insurance company.Some baggage agents may want you to wait a few days to see if your bag turns up. Essentially, they'll want to categorize it as missing first, then re-categorize it as stolen if it doesn't show up after a few days.
However, if you go along with this, you've lost valuable time during which you could have been filing reports with law enforcement agencies such as the local police and airport security.
The agent will allow you to report your luggage stolen if you insist. You may need to exercise the same assertiveness if you're filing your report over the phone.
If you file your report online or over the phone, make sure a written copy of the report is emailed to you so you have it for your records and to provide to law enforcement or insurance agencies.

, The extent to which the airline is liable for your loss varies among airlines and whether you were on an international or U.S. domestic flight. You should be able to find a basic summary of the applicable regulations at the airport or on the airline's website.For example, airlines are not liable for the loss of the contents of your stolen bag that are in excess of around $3,000. Some airlines may extend this coverage if you pay a small fee when you book your flight.
Many international carriers have even lower limits which may not even come close to covering everything you had packed in your stolen luggage.
Airline liability for lost or stolen luggage on international flights is governed by two international agreements. The Montreal Pact covers Canada, Australia, and European countries, as well as some others. Most other countries are covered by the Warsaw Pact.
Consumer agencies and travel publishers frequently have summaries of these agreements and how they affect you if your luggage is lost or stolen.
It can be a good idea to see if you can find a brochure that outlines your rights and the airline's responsibilities, so you can reference it when speaking with airline baggage or customer service agents.

, After filing your report, set reminders for yourself and check on the status of your claim at least once a day until it's resolved. The airline may not be in any rush to assess the situation unless you keep on them.The airline should give you a claim number when you file your written report. You can use that number to access your claim and get status updates, either online or over the phone.
Many major airlines have online apps you can use to check the status of your claim and set notifications when there is any significant change.
Start a log, and write down the date and time you talk to anyone at the airline, as well as the name of the person with whom you spoke. Get a first and last name, as well as a job title, so you can identify them if you speak to anyone else.

, Particularly if specific items were stolen from your bag, but not the bag itself, you must file a police report as soon as possible after you discover the theft. The airline and airport security agencies may require a copy of a police report before they take any action.Even if the local police insist that they don't have jurisdiction inside the airport, or that you have no way of knowing where your items were stolen, insist that the report be created.
If you're flying on a U.S. domestic flight, you also should file a theft report with the TSA. The agency has an online claim form you can use.
You also want to file a police report as soon as possible – typically within 24 hours of your discovery of the theft. The sooner you report the theft, the greater the likelihood that your luggage might be recovered.
Make sure you get copies of all written law enforcement reports you file so you have them for your records.

, If you're dissatisfied with the response you're getting from the airline, ask to speak to a supervisor and work your way up the chain of command. This can be especially effective if you have an airline agent claiming the airline isn't liable for your losses when you know legally they are.Any time you're speaking with a supervisor or manager, take the time to go through the timeline of your claim and correct any inaccuracies.
As with customer service or baggage claim agents, get the name and job title of anyone with whom you speak.
Repeat their words back to them or ask them to put anything significant they say to you in writing so you can hold them accountable.

"
Review your insurance policies.,
Contact your insurance company as soon as possible.,
Provide detailed information.,
Submit a copy of any theft reports.,
Follow up on your claim.",How to Take Action for Stolen Airline Luggage2," Some or all of the contents of your luggage may potentially be covered under a number of different insurance polices, including your homeowner's or renter's insurance as well as any travel insurance you purchased for your trip.This will be easier if your luggage was stolen on your trip home than if you're currently traveling, but use your best efforts to find the information you need.
Particularly if you were carrying relatively new items, it's possible a single item is covered under multiple insurance policies.
For example, if your laptop was stolen, it may be covered under the device warranty, your homeowner's or renter's insurance policy, and an insurance policy offered through the credit card you used to make the purchase.
When there are multiple policies in play, the key for you is to find the one that will give you the best recovery that will allow you to replace the covered item.
For example, if your travel insurance only covers depreciated value, while your homeowner's policy provides replacement value, you want to file your claim with your homeowner's insurance company.

, Insurance companies typically have deadlines that limit the time you have to file a claim for theft. The deadline may only be a few days, as measured from the time you noticed or reasonably should have noticed the theft.Understand that taking care of the situation may take a day out of your vacation, if you're still traveling. Ideally you want to file all the necessary reports and make your claims within 24 hours of your discovery of the theft.
Getting in touch with your insurance company may be difficult if you're traveling internationally. Keep time zones in mind when you make your call.
If your insurance company has a local office nearby, you may be able to save yourself some time and hassle by going into that office to file your claim rather than working with a representative on a customer service line or trying to file a claim online.

, The more factual details you provide, the more likely you are to get a fair recovery from the insurance company. You should provide details about the flight, including dates and times, along with specific descriptions of your luggage and the contents of your bags.List everyone with whom you spoke about the theft, including names and job titles for each person, so a claims agent can get in touch with the same people if necessary.
You'll need to make copies of all documentation of your flight, as well as any proof you have of the contents of your luggage.
If you're traveling and unsure where to get copies made, talk to the front desk clerk at your hotel. They may even make copies on the hotel's copier for you at no charge if you explain your situation.

, If you have a written report that you filed with the airline, you should provide a copy of that report to the insurance company. This makes it easier for the insurance agent to assess your claim and determine the airline's liability.Some insurance companies may require a police report before they'll accept the claim. If so, this requirement should be noted on the claim form.
It's possible you filed reports with the airline, local police, and airport security. If so, you should provide copies of all of them.

, It can be difficult to keep track of the status of an insurance claim if you're traveling. However, you need to keep in contact with the insurance company and make sure they can get in touch with you if anything changes or they need more information to process your claim.Once your claim is received, you should be assigned a claim number. Keep that number with all your other forms and information regarding the theft. You'll need it if you want to check on the status of your claim.
You may be contacted by a claims agent to ask questions about the theft and the contents of your bag or the specific items you've listed in your claim.
Keep in mind that honesty is the best policy here. If you fudge on your descriptions of items in your luggage and the insurance company finds out, you could find yourself charged with insurance fraud.

Avoid packing valuable items in checked bags.,
Keep an inventory of the items you packed.,
Secure your bags with approved locks.,
Choose luggage that stands out.,
Get to baggage claim quickly.",How to Take Action for Stolen Airline Luggage3," International agreements and national regulations limit airline liability for the contents of lost or stolen luggage significantly. Even insurance policies typically have limits and won't cover expensive items.You also need to avoid packing items in checked baggage that is unique or untraceable. Examples include signed contracts and cash.
If at all possible, arrange to carry electronic devices such as laptops or tablets in your carry-on luggage. The same goes for expensive cameras and camera equipment.
Most airlines accept no liability for loss of these types of items, and list them explicitly as exclusions. If you're going on a trip that requires you to bring along expensive equipment, you might want to check into having it shipped to your destination.
You also want to avoid including jewelry, fragile items, and anything with sentimental value. Essentially, if you cannot afford to replace it or if it is one of a kind, don't pack it in your checked baggage.
If you have expensive or irreplaceable souvenirs that you've picked up during your travel, consider having them shipped home rather than carrying them in your luggage. You may have to pay a little more for international shipping, but the items will be insured and handled by professionals.

, Before you head to the airport, make a list of the items in your checked bags. You also can take a picture of your open suitcase on your smart phone so you'll have it with you.Make sure you keep your inventory list on your person. For example, you might keep it on your phone. An inventory list would be pointless if you packed it in the checked bag.
Review the liability limits and keep them in mind when you're packing. If you have items that you know will push the value of the total contents of your bag over the top, consider packing them in a carry on if possible.
If you have a particularly expensive or important item, such as a laptop or a camera, that you regularly take with you when you travel, you might want to take out a separate insurance policy just for that item.

, Closing your bag properly and securing the closures with a lock makes your bag less attractive to potential luggage thieves. Theft typically is a crime of convenience, and if your bag doesn't look easy to open most thieves won't bother.On the other hand, having a lock on your bag may signal to would-be thieves that your bag contains something valuable or worth stealing.
When purchasing a lock (or luggage that comes with built-in locks) make sure it's approved by the air travel security agencies in the areas where you'll be traveling.
If you use an unapproved lock, security agents may break it or the fasteners that close your bag while conducting a routine search. This would make your bag more vulnerable to theft than it was in the first place.

, When purchasing new luggage, try to find something loud and colorful. Would-be thieves typically target plain black or navy blue bags that don't have any distinctive features. This makes it harder for you to identify your bag if you happen to catch them in the act.Another reason thieves often prefer nondescript bags is that, if stopped by security, it gives them the ability to pretend the whole thing was a mistake.
They'll tell a security agent that they didn't intend to steal the bag, they just thought it was theirs because all these bags look alike.
There's something to be said about choosing the gaudiest, loudest piece of luggage you can find. It's less likely to be stolen because nobody would want to be seen with it.
In addition, you may be able to get it at a lower price, since stores often discount ""ugly"" bags that no one wants.

, It takes awhile after you land for bags to start rolling through the carousel. If you don't dawdle in the airport, but proceed directly to baggage claim when you get off the plane, you may get their before your bag does.While most airlines provide claim tickets for checked baggage, these tickets are seldom checked and matched with the tag on a particular suitcase unless there's a blatant issue.
Additionally, the baggage claim area typically is located very close to the airport exits, so travelers can easily leave once they get off their plane.
This relatively insecure system makes it fairly easy for someone to simply walk up and take a bag off the carousel and head out the door before they are discovered.
When you get to the baggage area, stand as close as you can to the opening where bags are placed on the carousel. If you have a bright bag that stands out, you should notice it immediately and be able to take it home before it's even exposed to a would-be thief.

Avoid packing inappropriate or disallowed items, as that will prevent you from having to open your bag and remove them in the airport. This will weaken your other security steps, making your bag more vulnerable., Most common suitcases are made of fabric and open and close through zippers. A resourceful thief can easily bypass your lock by cutting through the fabric or using a pen to open the zipper. A hard case with clasps will be much more difficult to break into, and many thieves are looking for easy marks., The last thing you want is for electronic or battery-powered items from turning on in flight or while getting checked by security. Items running can draw the attention of security, and make it more likely they search your bag, making it less secure. Remove batteries or other power devices before packing to make sure nothing goes off at an inopportune time., Make sure you, and anyone who finds your luggage, knows it belongs to you. Your label should give your name, a destination address, and contact information like an email address and cell phone number. This way, if something happens to your bag, it will be much easier for the person who finds it to let you know where it is.One other good travel tip is to remove tags or stickers from previous flights. This will help to prevent the airline from accidentally sending your bag elsewhere than your destination.

, Close up your bag and use a lock to hold it shut. When you buy a lock for your luggage, make sure what you buy fits the case, otherwise you won’t be able to close your suitcase properly. A thick shackle is better, as it will be harder to pick or cut off. If your lock opens with a key, remember to keep that key with you at all times, probably best with the rest of your valuables.TSA-approved locks can be opened with particular keys held by TSA agents. Be warned, though, that those keys can be copied, and are not difficult to acquire online. In addition, many can be picked or broken relatively easily. You do not need to have a TSA-approved lock on your luggage, though if you don’t have one, TSA will break it if they feel they need to get into your bags.
If you use multiple locks, consider mixing the type of lock you use. This will help protect against criminals who only have one way to get through a lock, and can discourage would be thieves.
If your carry-on bag has a lock on it, be sure to use it when you board the plane. It can be a hassle to open again if you need something, but that way it is always locked if you should go to the bathroom or take a nap., Do your best to never let your bags out of your sight. Carry it with you everywhere you go in the airport, and watch them carefully. This will lessen the chances of someone walking off with your bag, or digging around where they shouldn’t be.In the few places that you can’t hold on to your bags, like at security, do you best to keep an eye on it. Watch to make sure your bag or bin goes into the X-ray machine, and to make sure it comes back out. Once your items are through, grab them and get away from the security point. You can put on your shoes elsewhere.

, This includes items you will want or need on the plane like your wallet, boarding pass, passport, driver’s license, or medicine. You want to keep valuable items near you as much as possible, which limits the chance of their being lost or stolen., Keeping these things in one place will help you if you need to look for them, as they will all be together and easily accessible. Alternatively, if you can’t find them quickly, you’ll notice right away that things are missing, and can alert the proper authorities., One way to discourage potential thieves is to wrap your suitcases in saran wrap or other plastic coverings. This won’t necessarily prevent someone from getting into your suitcase, as it is very easy to cut. However, it will let you know almost immediately if someone has tampered with your luggage when you retrieve it. This may cause potential thieves who are looking for stealth may skip your bag.Some major airports have wrapping service stations. You can pay for a machine to give you the plastic to wrap the bag after arriving at the airport., While you don’t want to bring expensive, fancy suitcases on your flight, you should be willing to add some kind of customization to your luggage. A fun sticker, colorful ribbons, or even just a different color luggage strap should be enough to let you know which bag is yours at a glance. This will make it easier to find when you arrive, and let you know very quickly if your bag is missing. It will also make it less likely that someone will take your bag by mistake., This will guarantee you can get space in the overhead bins and won’t need to check any luggage at the gate. You will also get your pick of the bins, so you can make sure your bag is close to you during the flight.Consider purchasing priority boarding privileges with your ticket, or signing up for a frequent flyer program that may give you that access in order to get on your plane quickly.

, Once you get on the plane, your need for items in your wallet like cash is minimal. Take the chance to bury it in your luggage, deep in the bag, which will make it harder for someone to slip it out during the flight. If it’s deep enough, someone who wanted to take it would need to take your entire bag and empty it out., Some people, when travelling at the back of the plane, like to store their bags up near the front, thinking it will make it easier to get off the plane. This will separate you from your bag, and make it much harder to keep track of who may be looking into your stuff. The closer your bag is to you, the easier it will be to watch.One good place for storing your bag is the overhead compartment across from your seat, rather than the one directly above you. This will allow you to see the compartment if someone should open it.

, When you load your luggage into the overhead compartment, make sure it goes in with the zippers and pockets facing inward. This will make it harder to open your bag, at least without you or someone else noticing.Alternatively, make sure the pockets are toward you when you put the bag under the seat. You don’t want the person in front of you to be able to reach down and pull something out that you can’t see. If you can see the pockets, you can see who is accessing them.

, If you notice someone handling your luggage who shouldn’t be, say something. Firmly acknowledging the potential theft should be enough to stop what is going on. If you do notice theft, stealing from luggage or stealing the luggage itself, let the flight attendant or security guard know immediately."

, If you bring something battery run, bring extra batteries. If it requires charging, fully charge it before the trip. Some airlines will offer USB ports to charge devices (as well normal home plug-ins if possible), but you will have to see if your seat has it. The top essentials for a carry on bag are a tablet with a few movies on it, headphones, a few snacks, a charger, your phone, and gum to help your ears when you land.

,, Make sure you drink lots of fluids, especially water

, Even in summertime, the planes are cold.

, This will also help you prevent your ears getting plugged when you're so high up in the air.But don't forget it on the plane!

Roll your clothes to avoid awkward wrinkling and have more space.
If you can wear it on the flight, do so instead of wasting luggage space. Dress in layers so you can bring more. Wear your jacket or sweatshirt onto the plane to avoid getting charged for the extra weight.

Enjoy your trip!",How to Pack for Japan (Teens)," As you will most likely be traveling by plane, you will have limits on how much you can take on board with you. Most flights will allow you to have two bags, one being a carry-on and the other being a checked bag, but neither can exceed a certain weight limit, and in the case of carry-ons, they are not allowed to exceed a certain size limit, either.


Keep in mind that not all things should go in your checked bag - some things should go in your carry-on. It's best to keep electronics, reading material, toiletries, and a change of clothes in your carry-on, as well as money, in case you don't get your suitcase back immediately. This can help decrease the weight of your suitcase.
Depending on how long your trip will be, you may not need a checked bag, which makes things much easier.
Most airlines allow a personal item, which can be a small bag. The general rule is that the bag can carry things onto the airplane, but it needs to fit under the seat in front of you. Things in the bag should consist of what you want to have while in flight, as you won't be able to access your carry-on.;
, There are basics that you will need when traveling, and it's best to create a checklist and cross items off as you pack them. Make sure not to pack too much, though!


The basics of what you will need will consist of clothes, toiletries, and money. It's best to take an extra pair of clothes in case one pair gets stained or dirty during the trip, but you don't need more than that.

The bare minimum you will need for clothes will usually consist of underwear, socks, pants, shirts, and a jacket. Keep in mind that this will also be dependent on the weather - if it's going to be rather cold, you may need gloves and a hat.


Toiletries consist of your toothbrush and toothpaste, hairbrush or comb, deodorant, and for girls, makeup and menstrual supplies. Be aware that liquids cannot exceed a certain size if they are being brought on carry-ons.
Make sure to convert money to the proper amount. As Japanese currency - known as yen - is different than your country's currency, you will need to make sure you have enough money. Do not rely on credit or debt cards, as you may not be able to use them abroad.
If you have a cell phone, take it with you. However, make sure that it can be used while abroad. Some cell phone companies may not cover areas that are outside of your home country.
If you take medications, these will need to go through airport security. However, don't leave them behind! You don't want a medication deficiency to ruin your trip to Japan.

, What you will need will differ depending on what you plan on doing during your trip. If you plan on mostly shopping and learning about the culture, that will require different things than if you plan on going on nature hikes and long tours.


Keep the weather in mind. If the temperatures will be cold, don't pack shorts!

, If you are bringing electronics with you to Japan, keep in mind that you may need to bring outlet adapters to plug things in. Power outlets in Japan are typically two-prong outlets, so a plug with three prongs will require an adapter.

, If your trip is short, you may only be taking a carry-on bag, in which case, things are much simpler. However, if you need to take a checked bag, this can be more difficult.


It's best to keep things such as phones and money in your personal bag. These are things that will be needed soon after getting off the plane, and you don't want to dig through your carry-on or your checked bag to find them.
Know the weight limits. Airlines have weight limits on checked bags and carry-ons, so make sure that however you pack, it doesn't exceed the weight limit.
Keep in mind that a checked bag runs the risk of getting lost or stolen. It's best not to put valuable items in checked bags for this reason.

, Whether packing a carry-on or a checked bag, it's best to put heaviest items on the bottoms so that they don't end up crushing something in your bag. Shoes, for example, are considered heavy, so it's best to put those in the bottom of the bag and then work your way up.


It's best not to pack more than two pairs of shoes. More than two pairs will cause the bag to get heavy and it may not fit the weight restrictions.

, Instead of packing your clothes while they're folded up, try rolling them instead. It will leave more space in your bag. However, keep in mind that this can wrinkle clothing, so it's best not to roll something you don't want to get messed up.

, When packing toiletries, for example, it's best to put them in a small bag so that they don't get separated when the bag gets jostled around. It may also be a good idea to put shoes in plastic bags for sanitary reasons - you don't want markings all over your clothes!

, Know how long the flight will be, and pack things to keep yourself occupied in the meantime. It's usually best to bring things such as reading material, as you may not be able to charge electronics or have Wi-Fi on a plane. Just remember that some airlines will provide charge plugs and/or Wi-Fi, depending on Airbus or Boeing fleet.

, As the flight may be long, it might be a good idea to purchase food before leaving the airport. Make sure you have currency to exchange, as Japanese money (yen) has different currency values.


Do not rely on a credit or debt card. It's possible these won't be accepted, the shop doesn't have a machine for it, or another thing that could go wrong. Make sure you always have some money on you no matter what.

, As you are a teenager, you're probably not going to need to go to a business meeting right after getting off the flight and into Japan. It's generally best to wear a comfortable pair of pants and shirt, as well as a jacket, since planes can get cold.

, As there's typically no Wi-Fi or reception on a plane, your cell phone won't be a source of entertainment unless you have games on it. Common ways of passing time include reading books, writing or drawing, finishing any work you may have with you, or sleeping. Depending on your airline and the fleet of Boeing or Airbus, Wi-Fi might be available. Check with your airline to make sure.

, Know that the flight is only part of it - a beginning to fun and great memories in Japan!

The second and final thing you should pack are the things that are for entertainment.",How to Pack a Carry on Bag Full of Fun for a Long Plane Ride," A good carry-on bag should be small enough and light enough that you can carry it easily. However, it should not be so small that it cannot fit everything you need. It also must be small enough that it fits under the seat in front of you or in the overhead bin. There are many types of bags that work well as carry-on luggage. Any one of the following choices are valid alternatives These bags include:

A duffel bag. If you choose to use a duffel bag, it should have good handles and/or an over-the-shoulder strap.



 


A small wheeled suitcase
This should be small enough to fit in the overhead bin.






A backpack.
This backpack should be of a fairly large size with many pockets. It also should be sturdy and durable. If it gets dirty or broken, you shouldn't have to worry about it.






A messenger bag.
This bag should have an adjustable strap. This is one of the lesser alternatives, as it is much less comfortable to carry a messenger bag over one shoulder than it is to carry a backpack on two.





;
, This list should start broad. Put down everything and anything you may want or need. And only after you have put everything down, begin to narrow down the list. Cross things you don't really need off.

A rucksack is a good choice for a bag. It has lots of pockets and is easy to carry.;
, Try a track suit, leggings that aren't too tight and a vest top with a jacket in case it's cold on the plane.


Don't wear a mini skirt or shorts even if you are going to a hot country. Long haul flights can be uncomfortable, and if you want to sleep on the plane, it will be harder to do so in shorts and a mini skirt.

, Remember to think about keeping it simple and not over packing. Things to consider are:


Gadgets- iPad, kindle, 3DS, camera, computer, phone, etc. (If you don't have any of these, then don't worry. You don't need them.)
A journal- it may sound silly, but it's a good thing to record what you did on your ""holiday"" when you go. It's also good entertainment for the plane.
An eye mask, ear plugs, a mini pillow and/or a blanket and comfy bed socks. You wouldn't need these sleep items if you were going on a short flight, but on a long haul flight, it's nice to sleep on the plane. You don't have to take all of this but it's nice to have some of this. Usually, the plane provides a pillow and blanket, but in case yours doesn't, you can take these items.
Moisturizer, pot of face wash, hand cream, hand sanitizer, roll on, deodorant, mini bottle of perfume, lip stain, concealer, mascara and wet wipes. Put in a Ziploc bag if you're taking liquids that aren't in your suitcase. You could also put a mini fold up brush in there along with a travel toothbrush and toothpaste and anything else you might want to freshen up after your flight.
Feminine products- Us girls have to stay fresh and it's always good to have them in there just in case.
Purse and passport- It's always good to have a purse to keep your money in, and you have to have your passport so you can go on holiday.
Accessories- These are things like headphones, a pen, a scrapbook to scribble in, a bobble on your wrist, your sunglasses and your sun hat.
Snacks. Try buying sweets or snacks at the airport because the airplane food isn't the best. Sweets, cereal bars, a sandwich, and a non fizzy drink at the airport are good choices.

, Don't overpack, but use all the pockets in the bag.

",How to Pack a Carry on Bag for Girls," Your bag should be light, big enough to carry what you need and cute. Try not to get a bag that looks flashy/expensive because it might be stolen. If you're going on a long-haul flight, try to carry a backpack, because if you have a handbag/purse, everything will seem heavier.;
, Some items that are almost always handy are:


iPod/iPhone. Try to download some new podcasts (these are free on the Internet), or download some new songs from iTunes or a CD.
Books/ Magazines. If you like books, bring something you like to read, such as your favorite novel. If you want magazines, bring a bunch that have all your favorite gossip, tips and other things you like.
Earphones. These are vital. Try to bring 2 pairs, in case one of yours stops working. (This occasionally happens and the plane earphones are not good at all)
Portable DVD/Game player. If your plane has Auto-Video on demand, then you will not need the DVD player. Having a Game player is always handy though, just make sure you charge it.
A journal. If you already started one, bring it along. If not, then it's the perfect time to start one on the plane! That way you'll have a record of your trip.

, You do not want to be stuck on an 18-hour flight in your tight mini skirt or your graduation suit (it's possible). Try something cute and comfortable, the best of both worlds. Try loose jeans, (Not skinny jeans!) a tank top/ T-Shirt, and a light jacket, since air planes can get cold. If you are going on a long/ overnight flight, you may want to think about bringing an extra pair of comfortable clothes such as loose sweat pants and an extra T-shirt. Unless your night-clothes are appropriate/ warm enough for the plane, these things are your best bet.

,, Do not wear long/dangling earrings. Try studs or better yet, none at all Necklaces and bracelets will get in the way, and belts can be uncomfortable, especially with the seat belt. Try to keep it to just 1 watch (with the time of the place your going to) and studs, if you have your ears pierced.

, Other things you may want include sleeping pills (herbal or medicated) and a small pillow. You might also want to bring a small blanket. 

, If you do bring one, leave it in your bag.

, Airplane food might be gross to you, and sometimes they won't give you a free meal. Try those cute little cereal boxes, snack mixes (Chex-mix, cheese-it mix, Cheerios-mix.) If you are on a diet, or want something healthier, try granola mix, some of your favorite, non-sugary cereal in a plastic baggie. Also, if you want, you could order a special meal from the airlines, such as low sodium, vegetarian, or diabetic. They are usually served first and taste better.

, If by some weird reason, you're with other people and let's say your suitcase is too full, you may have another small suitcase to drag along with you. Try to keep that one quite light and easy to pull around. You don't want start breaking sweat when you leave the airplane.

This is particularly true during peak traveling times such as around the holidays.
When there are hundreds of passengers who are delayed, the airline may be unable to accommodate everyone. If there's a legitimate reason the airline should make an exception for you, be prepared to explain the situation. For example, you may be traveling for a serious personal reason such as a funeral. In a case like that, airline staff may be more sympathetic to your plight.
Keep your emotions in check. Although you may be angry, it won't do you any good to take that anger out on airline staff who are just doing their job. You'll get a lot further if you're courteous and polite to everyone with whom you speak.
Make sure you get full names of anyone with whom you speak. If you end up filing a claim for compensation, you will need to provide this information.;
, Unless weather has grounded all flights to your destination, you may be able to find a plane flying out at a similar time that is run by another carrier. If you find an appropriate flight, ask airline staff for an endorsement.If the first airline endorses your ticket, the amount you paid will go towards the price of a seat on the new flight. However, you'll still have to pay the difference if your new ticket is more expensive.
Make sure the first airline won't charge you a cancellation fee if you switch, and confirm the price of the new ticket.
You'll typically have more luck doing this by calling the airlines' toll-free customer service numbers than you will trying to work with airline staff in person at the ticket counter.

, If you purchased your plane tickets using a credit card, you may be able to use the chargeback process to get your money back for the cost of the flight.The chargeback process is available any time you purchase something with a credit card and the item or service is faulty or not as promised. Significant flight delays can qualify for chargebacks, especially if the delay was caused by a mechanical failure or something else within the airline's control.
Keep in mind that there are deadlines for initiating a chargeback, so you need to start the process as soon as possible. The deadline ranges from 60 to 120 days after you had notice of the problem.
To being the chargeback process, call the customer service number of the company that issued the credit card you used to purchase your tickets. Some credit card companies also allow you to initiate a chargeback from their website.
You will be expected to provide your card number, the date of the transaction, and the reason for your chargeback. To safeguard your private information, avoid doing this while you're at the airport. Wait until you're alone.
A chargeback won't help you at the moment, since the chargeback process can take weeks or even months, but you could eventually get compensated in the form of a refund. However, there's no guarantee that the airline will accept the chargeback, and they may turn around and argue that you're in breach of contract – especially if you ultimately flew with them despite the delay.

, If you're flying within the EU on an aircraft operated by a carrier headquartered in the EU, compensation for flight delays is governed by EU regulations that require carriers to compensate passengers for some delays. Your claim letter should include the following information:Your name, street address, phone number, and email address
The names of any other passengers for whom you purchased tickets, such as family members traveling with you
Any reference numbers associated with your booking or itinerary
The dates of your travel
The flight number and the airports associated with your departure and arrival
Details about the delay, including the length of the delay and the reasons given to you for the delay
Names of all staff with whom you spoke regarding the delay, and a summary of their statements
Copies of any receipts, confirmations, boring passes, or other evidence of your booking

, Check the airline's website or call their customer service number to find out where your claim letter should be sent. Before you mail your letter, make at least one copy of it for your own records.There are various websites and mobile apps that claim they will submit your claim for you. Some of them may charge a fee for their services. Use these at your own risk, keeping in mind that it doesn't take tremendous effort on your part to submit the claim yourself.
Mail the claim letter using a service that will allow you to track the progress of the letter and confirm when it is received. Keep this tracking information with your copy of the letter.
If you don't hear from the airline within a week or two, call their customer service line again to follow up on your claim.

, In addition to filing a claim for compensation with the airline, you may want to contact the government agency responsible for regulating air travel in your country and describe the situation.You also may want to file a complaint if the airline refuses your claim and you believe you have a valid claim and are eligible for compensation.
To figure out which country regulates your flight, you'll need to consider the country from which your flight was scheduled to depart, and the country in which the airline was headquartered. Any of these countries may be responsible for regulating either your flight or the airline, depending on your departure and destination locations.
If you were departing from within the EU and are seeking compensation for a flight delay from an airline headquartered in the EU, you also may have the option of filing a lawsuit in small claims court if the airline has refused your claim., Look over the airline's policy when you book your tickets so you have a good idea of their procedures if your flight is delayed. Print out or save a link to the airline's policy for flight delays and cancellations before you get to the airport so you can access it easily.Mark or highlight information about flight delays, as well as the airline's customer service number, so you can find them easily. You may want to put the customer service number in your mobile phone.
There also may be limited information regarding compensation for flight delays or cancellations on your ticket or boarding pass.
Keep in mind that airlines don't provide any guarantee regarding the time when the flight will depart. There are many reasons for delays, including air traffic congestion and bad weather, over which the airline has no control.

, Your flight typically will be regulated by the country from which the flight departs. You also may want to look at the regulations in the country in which the airline is headquartered, if it is different from your departure country.Identify which country is responsible for regulating your flight before you depart. Look for the national transportation agency's website to find more information about traveler's rights.
If there are any guarantees of compensation for flight delays required by law, you'll be able to find out more about these regulations on the transportation agency's website.
Print copies of any information related to compensation for flight delays so you can keep it with you as you begin your travels.

, As soon as possible after your flight is delayed, speak with airline staff and find out why your flight is delayed and how long they expect the delay to last. The official reason for the delay may impact whether you are entitled to compensation.If you're at the mercy of the airline policy, keep in mind that even the most generous of those typically don't provide compensation for flight delays caused by weather.
Within the EU, you generally may be entitled to compensation unless that airline can prove that the delay was caused by ""extraordinary circumstances."" This phrase is a legal term which generally includes serious circumstances outside the airline's control, such as severe weather, security risks, or political instability either at your destination or en route that makes flying dangerous.
Keep in mind that sometimes airlines will claim extraordinary circumstances despite the fact that none exist. In those cases, you are free to challenge the airline's decision. You typically must present evidence to support your argument. For example, if the airline claims severe weather was the reason for the delay, you may point to the fact that flights operated by other airlines were making the same trip without delay as evidence that severe weather wasn't the real reason for the delay.

, You may be entitled to compensation for a delay under the denied boarding regulation if you are flying within the EU on a community carrier which has its headquarters and main place of business in the EU.You also are entitled to compensation if you are flying out of an EU airport, regardless of where the airline is headquartered.
If your flight departed from an airport outside the EU, you are only entitled to compensation under EU regulations if you were flying on an airline that is headquartered or has a principal place of business in the EU.

, If your flight delay falls under EU regulation, you are entitled to varying amounts of compensation depending on the length of the delay and the distance of your flight.For flights delayed by more than three hours, you are entitled to 250 Euros if your flight was less than 1500 km (932 miles).
If your flight was more than 1500 km (932 miles) and was entirely within the EU, you are entitled to 400 Euros compensation if your flight was delayed by more than three hours.
When flying from an EU airport to an airport outside the EU, you are entitled to 400 Euros compensation if your flight was between 1500 km (932 miles) and 3500 km (2175 miles) and is delayed by more than three hours.
If your flight was between 1500 km (932 miles) and 3500 km (2175 miles) and entirely outside the EU, but on an EU-based airline, you are entitled to 400 Euros if the flight is delayed by more than three hours.
For flights more than 3500 km (2175 miles) that are between three and four hours delayed, you're entitled to 300 Euros.
You can get 600 Euros compensation for a delay of more than four hours if your flight is more than 3500 km (2175 miles).
You are entitled to free meals and refreshments appropriate given the time of day and length of the delay, two free phone calls or faxes, and free hotel accommodations if the delay requires you to stay overnight.

, As you're planning your trip, review the average weather both at your destination and along the flight path to determine the likelihood of severe weather delays. While weather is unpredictable, there are certain times of the year when the likelihood of severe weather is greater than others.For example, you may face a greater likelihood of severe weather delays if you fly into hurricane-prone areas such as the Caribbean during hurricane season.
Likewise, you may run into significant weather delays if you're flying to a northern location during the winter months.
In addition to weather, you also want to be aware of political events, upheaval, and security risks at your destination and along your flight path. These sorts of situations also can cause delays or even cancellation of commercial flights.

, Because airlines don't guarantee their flight schedules and the time of your departure may change, do everything you can to avoid booking a flight that is scheduled to land at the last minute.For example, if you're flying in for a business meeting that starts at 2:00 p.m., it would be risky to book a flight that is scheduled to land at 1:00 p.m. Even a delay of less than an hour could cause you to miss your meeting. If you're allowed to expense an extra night in a hotel, consider arriving the night before. If not, pick a flight as early in the morning as possible.
The earlier in the day the flight departs, the less likely that it will be delayed. keep this in mind particularly if you have one or more connecting flights.
If you're traveling for pleasure and you have hotel or cruise ship reservations, try to book a flight for the day before or overnight so delays won't ruin or overly complicate your plans.

, Even if you aren't flying into or out of an EU airport, you can still take advantage of the EU regulations entitling you to compensation for flight delays if you fly on an aircraft operated by an airline headquartered in the EU.Airlines that are headquartered or have their principal place of business within the EU are covered by the EU regulation requiring compensation for flight delays.
If you're not sure whether an airline is considered an EU-based airline, check on the airline's website. In the UK, you may also check with the Civil Aviation Authority to see if the airline is regulated by the EU.

, Particularly if you are planning a lengthy and extensive international trip, travel insurance may provide you with compensation if any of your flights are delayed more than a few hours.Travel insurance has broader coverage for delays, so you may want to consider travel insurance even if you're traveling within the EU and entitled to compensation under the EU regulations.
Typically you can get compensation for delays for almost any reason, including severe weather, civil disorder, or mechanical problems. Travel insurance also covers delays caused by something on your end, such as a lost or stolen passport or wallet.
However, your flight typically must be delayed by at least five or six hours before travel insurance kicks in. At that point, you are only entitled to reimbursement for costs you incur as a result of the delay, such as meals and accommodations. Make sure you retain all receipts to submit when you file your claim.

, If you have a choice in the method of payment you use to book your flight, look for a credit card that provides compensation for delayed flights and use it to purchase your tickets.Most preferred travel cards will reimburse up to $500 in expenses. Like travel insurance, you only get reimbursement for expenses you incur – not any additional payment or compensation – and you must keep receipts for any expenses you expect the credit card company to reimburse (even if you charge those expenses on the same card).
This coverage typically only kicks in if your flight is delayed for more than 12 hours. At that point, even $500 may not go very far depending on where you are, the time of year, the reason for the delay, and how many travelers are affected.
Another thing to keep in mind is that many of these cards have average fees of several hundred dollars, which can negate the value of delay coverage. For example, there are at least three preferred travel credit cards that reimburse up to $500 of expenses if your flight is delayed by three hours. However, each of these cards has an annual fee of $500.
Ultimately, using a preferred travel card may be more beneficial to you if you travel frequently, particularly if you make regular international trips.

The earlier you check in, the better position you will secure for yourself. Check-In begins 24 hours prior to your departure time.The earlier you board the plane, the more seating options will be available to you.
Set an alarm on your phone to alert you before you want to check in.
Depending on your departure time this can be inconvenient. You may need to wake up early, stay up late, or leave a meeting. Consider this when you are booking your flight.;
, EarlyBird Check-In gives you a head start of half a day on the average passenger. Southwest will automatically check you in 36 hours prior to your flight, giving you a better chance at an A or B boarding position.Since the system checks you in automatically, you don’t have to worry about remembering to check in on time or waking up in the middle of the night to do it yourself.
After being automatically checked in, you can download your boarding pass to your phone, or print it at a kiosk when you arrive at the airport.

, The only way to ensure that you are in Group A 1-15 is to purchase a Business Select ticket. While Southwest Airlines does not have a First Class or Business section, they do offer this perk for the extra cost of $30-$40 depending on your trip.Purchase your ticket early to ensure that the Business Select fare is still available on your flight.
Additional bonuses include a coupon for a free alcoholic beverage, earning bonus reward miles, and access to the Fly By lane at security to ensure you make it through the airport and to your plane on time.

, Once you have flown 25 legs of flights on Southwest Airlines, you will reach the level of an A-List Member. This will earn you preferred status and one of the A position boarding passes reserved for advanced reward program members.After flying 50 legs, you will reach A-List Preferred status and you will be in the front of the line even above A-List Members.

, If you are traveling with a child who is six years old or younger, you can board the plane during family boarding. Southwest allows Group A to board first to accommodate passengers who have paid for early boarding or earned status in their rewards program. After Group A boards, they take a break to allow people with young children to board.


Even if you aren’t able to find seats together, you are likely to find someone who will trade seats in order to allow children to sit with their parents. Ask around and get a flight attendant to assist you., Once everyone has boarded the plane, the flight attendant will take a head count of all the passengers. Once they have completed their count, you are allowed to change seats before the plane moves away from the gate. If you are seated next to someone, but there is a row with two empty seats, ask the flight attendant if you can move.


Don’t worry about offending the other passengers in the row, they will be happy to have an empty seat as well.

However, you only have seven days from the date you receive your bag to file a claim for missing items, or for damage to the bag or its contents.
The time is longer for international flights, but for domestic flights you may have only 24 hours to report the loss or damage of your bag or your claim will be denied.;
, If you notify the airline that your bags are missing while you are at the airport, you should receive a reference number you can use to check the status of your claim.Make sure you provide the airline with a phone number where you can be reached, as well as the address where you will be staying. Don't put your home address or phone number if you're not at home.
Typically you also will have the ability to check the status of your bag claim by checking online after you provide the airline with notification that it is missing. The airline representative who takes your report will give you more information.

, You typically must provide a description of your bag, including its approximate size, color, and composition.Keep in mind that the details you provide also are intended to assist baggage handlers and other airline personnel in locating your bag. Be sure to include any particular details that set your bag apart from everyone else's and might make it easier to recognize.

, If you had to purchase any items to replace those you'd packed in your lost baggage, the airline may reimburse you for those purchases.Some airlines provide a daily stipend to cover reasonable expenses you incur as a result of being without your bag. For example, Delta will give you a stipend of up to $50 a day for the first five days your bag is missing. Additional expenses may be covered depending on your situation.Airlines and travel guides typically recommend that you include toiletries and a change of clothes in your carry-on so you're prepared in the event your flight is delayed or your baggage is lost. #Calculate the value of your claim. The total value of your claim includes the value of the contents of your bag as well as the luggage itself.Keep in mind that you will have to provide proof that your bag and its contents are actually worth the amount you've entered. Without receipts, this can be exceedingly difficult – and you are unlikely to have receipts for items such as personal clothing you purchased months or even years before your trip.
Typically your bag will be found after a few days. For this reason, many airlines such as Delta and American Airlines don't accept the claim form until your bag has been missing for five days., Creating a list of the items in your bag can assist you in calculating the value of your bag in the event the airline loses it.You also should consider taking an inventory of the items in the bags you plan to carry on with you, in case something is stolen. It can be difficult to remember exactly everything you had in your bag when you no longer have it.
Keep in mind the relative value of the items you pack, and avoid taking something expensive when you have something less valuable that would fulfill the same need.

, Photos can be used to back up your inventory and support your calculation of the value of your belongings.


Snapping a photo often is easier than making an itemized list of everything in your suitcase – just be careful if you've got some items covered by others or zipped away in pockets.
Keep in mind that proving the value of your possessions can be very difficult without receipts. However, photos of the items in good condition can help prove a reasonable value.

, Receipts are the easiest way to prove the value of something.If you've purchased something that has sentimental value as a souvenir of your adventure, consider carrying it on the plane with you if at all possible rather than including it in your checked bag.
Particularly if you're going on a long trip, consider packing a soft-sided carry-on in your checked suitcase. The bag will lay flat and take up little room, but can be opened and used to pack the souvenirs and mementos you acquire over the course of your trip.

, The airline will only pay up to a maximum dollar amount for your lost or damaged baggage, regardless of the total value of your claim.


For domestic flights, airlines are required to compensate you for the value of your bag and its contents, up to $3,300.If you're traveling internationally, your baggage is probably covered by the Montreal Convention, which requires airlines to compensate you up to around $1,750 for lost or damaged baggage. that total amount may vary depending on the exchange rate at the time of your travel.
Other countries may have their own regulations that provide you with more or less compensation, depending on where you were flying and where the flight originated.
In addition to the maximum dollar amounts, airlines may exempt certain items such as cameras or computer equipment in checked bags that can easily be damaged., The insurance you already have may provide additional coverage for the property you take with you when you travel.Your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers your property if it is lost or stolen, and may include luggage while you are on a trip. You should call your insurance carrier to make sure before you rely on this coverage.
In some cases, your insurance company will pay you and then seek reimbursement from the airline. This generally is to your advantage, since you probably will get money to replace the lost items more quickly.
Keep in mind that your homeowner's or renter's insurance policy likely only covers loss or damage of your property against ""named perils"" such as fire, vandalism, or theft. Read your policy carefully to determine exactly what is covered.

, Travel insurance policies likely compensate you for lost or damaged baggage beyond the airline's maximum limits.If you travel often, you might consider getting a separate baggage policy that will cover all of your checked bags for a year.
Some travel-oriented credit cards offer travel insurance as one of their perks. Check your credit card agreement to see if you have it and what the restrictions are. Keep in mind you typically must purchase your plane tickets on that card to use the coverage on your trip.
Read your policy carefully and make sure you understand what it covers before you begin your trip. Report to your travel insurance carrier if the dates or cost of your trip changes to avoid having your claim denied., If you're traveling with something you can't live without or can't afford to replace, carry it on or arrange to ship it separately.


Keep in mind that valuable items such as computers, cameras, and jewelry typically don't fall under an airline's liability for loss or damage.Keep airline liability limits in mind as you pack your bags. If you start to go over the threshold, consider moving some items to a carry-on, checking two bags, or leaving some of the more expensive items at home.If you have little choice but to check a high-priced item, ask your airline if it provides additional baggage insurance. Some carriers allow you to purchase coverage for property that exceeds an airline's limits. For example, you can buy insurance from United for $1 per $100 insured, up to $5,000 in value."

If you feel especially tense at any point during the flight, go back to your calming music/ nature sounds, squeeze and release your stress ball, do some small, in seat exercises, and try this effective technique:Starting with your feet, and moving up your whole body, tense and squeeze all the muscles in your body as hard as you can.,
Bring something that makes you happy or comforts you.,
Make yourself comfortable!,
The biggest thing is to distract you mind and control your stress when it reaches a high point.",How to Distract Yourself on a Plane," Planes ARE safe and statistically, they are actually the number 1 safest way to travel! There is a very, very, very low chance of anything happening- a much lower chance than when you drive in a car, even.;
, This will help because you won't have to look down.

, If you feel stressed, then bring along a small squeeze ball or stuffed animal to discretely squeeze. Believe it or not, this will help alleviate tension.

, Sometimes, just the noise of the engines is enough to stir someone up. Audiobooks are also very calming and distracting.

, Watch the movie, read a good book, listen to music, do a craft project or a crossword puzzle- anything to keep you busy.

,, Sometimes, the simple act of wearing a cozy hat can relieve mental insecurity and make you feel more at ease.

, Hold this as long as you possibly can and then gently, from head to toe, release all you tension and FULLY relax every muscle in your body as much as you possibly can. Take a few slow sips of water, take a few deep breaths and repeat if necessary. This should help.

, This might include a favorite, small plush animal or maybe a comfort food to indulge yourself in.

, It's hard not to feel stressed when you're too cold or sore from the hard seat. Be sure to bring along a small throw blanket, a pillow, a shawl, slippers, a sweatshirt or whatever will make you comfy while traveling.

, If you try to do these things, you should be fine. Remember, flying makes everyone at least a LITTLE nervous, but, if you follow these techniques, you'll be there before you know it!"

Pick an outfit that is comfortable.,
Some ideas for what to wear are leggings, a t-shirt, a hoodie, yoga pants, or long-sleeved shirt.,
Shoes are also really important.,
For hair, choose something simple.,
If you must take a purse, bring a small one.",How to Dress for Air Travel (for Girl Teens)," This is an airport, not a catwalk. Comfortable clothes are best because they don't annoy you on your flight.
, Try to wear layers in case it gets colder or warmer on the plane!, Sandals may seem like a good idea, but it can get cold on the plane. Opt for slip-on flats or comfy sneakers. Slip-ons would be the best to wear because you may have to remove your shoes for a security check. Also try to avoid high heels. They can easily compromise your ability to move if you must run to the gate., Wear it down or in a ponytail, but be aware that it's hard to comfortably get your head on the headrest with a ponytail sticking out., Put all of your small things in a carry-on bag to store beneath a seat, instead of an open-topped purse (which things could fall out of)."

Head to the back of the plane.,
Sit in the aisle seat.,
Get help from your travel companion.",How to Have an Empty Seat Next to You on Southwest Airlines2," Planes tend to fill from the front to the back. Many people choose to sit near the front of the plane so they can get off quickly once it lands. The elderly may choose not to navigate the aisle all the way to the back. Choose a seat at the back of the plane. Less people will make it that far.


Once the aisle and window seats fill, the flight attendant will make an announcement to let people know they should take the first available seat. People tend to sit near the front once they hear this announcement.

, Obviously no one chooses to be sandwiched in the dreaded center seat, so your choice is between the window or the aisle. Sit in an aisle seat in a row where there is already someone in the window seat. People don’t like to ask someone to get up and will pass you by to find a less imposing option., If you are traveling with someone, never sit next to them on the plane. One of you should sit in the aisle and the other in the window. This forces anyone entering the plane to choose the center seat when they get to your row, which is less appealing. You and your travel partner are more likely to have the row to yourselves.If the plane does fill up and someone must sit in the center, it is likely that they will gladly trade with one of you for the window or aisle so that you can sit together.
If you aren’t traveling with a companion, you can still employ this tactic by sitting in a row where the window or aisle seat is already occupied. This will keep couples from sitting in the two available seats in the row.

"
"
Act sick.,
Make a lot of noise.,
Use your size.,
Create an inconvenience.,
Go to sleep as soon as you sit down.,
Attempt to save the seat for someone else.,
Follow the rules.",How to Have an Empty Seat Next to You on Southwest Airlines3," Whether you are actually sick or not, carry some tissues with you and do your best to look miserable. People on planes are usually on their way to work or vacation. No one wants to or can afford to contract your illness., No one wants to sit next to an annoying, loud passenger. Speak loudly into your phone. An even better option is turning up the music in your headphones. This is a noise that will continue for the duration of the flight even after cell phones are disabled.


Either way, you will appear not to be able to hear anyone or respond if they ask you to get up from the aisle seat so they can get into your row., Southwest Airlines will allow larger passengers to occupy two seats. They prefer that you let them know beforehand by purchasing an extra ticket, so they can reserve that seat on the plane. The distance between armrests is 17 inches. If you do not fit, you qualify for the extra seat.Once you complete your trip you can apply for a refund of the cost of the second seat.
You can be awarded the second seat free of charge at the gate, but run the risk of the flight being full and not having an additional seat available.

, Put down your tray table and spread out. Use the things you have at your disposal to appear busy and spread across the empty seat while others are boarding the plane. You don't want to just set a bag in the seat and save it, but you can make sitting in the empty seat far less convenient to other passengers.Put down your tray table on the aisle seat and start working on your laptop to make moving a disturbance. Spread your files across the empty seat.
Set up a meal on your tray table. Spread the bag of food and some of the food items on the seat next to you.

, This is especially useful in the aisle seat. Get out your neck pillow and close your eyes to deter people from disturbing you to enter the row.You can also lean your head on the empty seat to make it seem like an uncomfortable seat option.

, This is sometimes frowned upon, but not explicitly disallowed. Tell the other passengers that you have a travel companion with a later boarding position and you would like to save the seat for them. You can also say that your companion is in the bathroom, but will be returning to that seat.Sell this by placing your carry-on bag under the seat you are saving.
Be prepared to be met with contention from boarding passengers wishing to sit in the empty seat.
If you don’t actually have a companion you are saving the seat for, you can be found out and lose the seat or anger some passengers.

, While the flight attendant hopes to help you have a comfortable flight, the main concern is every passenger's safety. Ultimately you want to follow the rules and do as the flight attendant says. In fact, if you are too unruly, you could be removed from the plane. Don't make your seat the empty seat!"

Find an airline agent.,
Insist on filing a written report.,
Get an arrival estimate.,
Determine which law applies.",How to Request Compensation for Delayed Airline Luggage1," The moment you realize that your bags are not on the baggage carousel, locate the airline's baggage claim office immediately. Tell the agent that your bags did not come out with the other bags on your flight.There's no legal requirement that you report your missing luggage immediately, but it does increase the chances you'll receive compensation. Some airline policies may require it.
Keep in mind that you probably aren't the only passenger with missing bags. You may have to wait awhile before you can talk to an agent. If you have somewhere you need to be, take this into account before you get in line at the baggage claim office.
Be prepared to show the agent your boarding pass and photo identification. If you have a claim ticket for your checked bags with the barcode, it can help the agent locate your bag.
When you just finished a trip with several connecting flights that involved multiple airlines, any one of those airlines may be responsible for the delay. Report your missing bags to the last airline you boarded and let them sort it out.;
, Often a baggage agent will tell you that bags are put on the next immediate flight, and all you have to do is wait an hour or so. However, this assumes that your bags were identified before that flight left.Typically the baggage agent will give you a form to fill out. Make sure you get a copy of your form before you leave.
On your report, include all details of your flight, including where you started, any connections you made, and any other airlines that were involved in your travel. Be sure to list the flight numbers, which can be found on your boarding passes or flight itinerary.
If you don't have time to fill out forms at the airport – for example, you may be on a tour and had to get on the bus departing the airport – you usually can file a claim later by visiting the airline's website or calling the airline's toll-free customer service number.

, After you've completed a written report and the baggage agent has checked the airline's system, they should be able to tell you where your bags are and when they will get to the airport.An estimate of when your baggage can be retrieved may determine whether it is classified as lost, or simply delayed. This classification can affect the compensation to which you're entitled.
While U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations don't address this, on international flights your bags must be classified as lost if they are delayed more than 21 days.
Provided the agent is able to locate your bag, they typically will classify it as delayed at that point. If they are unable to locate it, they may initially classify it as missing – but this doesn't mean it won't later be found.
Even if your bag is categorized as completely lost, it typically will be recovered within the next week. Most lost baggage is found within 48 hours.

, Before you request compensation for delayed airline luggage, you need to understand your rights as an air traveler and the airline's responsibility with regard to your checked bags.Domestic U.S. flights are governed by DOT regulations, while international flights are governed either by the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention.
The Montreal Convention is more traveler-friendly than the Warsaw Convention, and entitles you to greater compensation and more protection for delayed airline luggage.
The more than 100 countries who have signed on to the Montreal Convention include all of Europe, Canada, and Australia. If the Montreal Convention does not apply to your situation, the Warsaw Convention most likely does.
Knowing the law that applies can help you assert your rights to the airline. You may be more likely to get the compensation to which you're entitled if, for example, you say ""I'm claiming compensation under the Montreal Convention.""

"
"
Assess your situation.,
File a claim to cover immediate needs.,
Save all receipts.,
Consider filing an insurance claim.",How to Request Compensation for Delayed Airline Luggage2," Generally, compensation for delayed airline luggage takes the form of reimbursement for essentials, such as toiletries and underwear, that you need to purchase to get you by in the interim until your bag arrives.This means you're probably not going to get much assistance if the delay occurred on the final leg of your flight home. The airline will assume that you have items such as toiletries and underwear at home beyond what you packed in your bags for your trip.
If your flight was covered by the Montreal Convention, you are entitled to a set amount of compensation for each day your bags are delayed. The Warsaw Convention offers similar compensation, although the amount is less than that offered under the Montreal Convention.
Keep in mind that if you're traveling within the United States, there are few regulatory requirements regarding baggage delays.
Check the airline's policy. Some airlines such as Delta offer flat compensation of $50 a day for baggage delays, but you may need to mention the policy to enforce it.

, Depending on your situation, there may be things that you need immediately. If so, you should try to secure replacements before you leave the airport. Get the airline to assist you.Some airlines will simply give you a voucher to pay for replacement toiletries and the like. They also may have branded items to give to passengers in your situation. This typically takes the form of a small bag with travel sized shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion.
If you have special needs or were carrying items for someone with special needs, let the agent know. For example, you may have to use a particular shampoo because of allergies.
Many airlines will offer immediate compensation in the form of vouchers to cover your immediate needs, particularly if it's estimated you won't be able to retrieve your bags for at least 24 hours. However, you have to ask. The agent typically won't offer you anything voluntarily.

, The airline cannot reimburse you without proof of the expenditures you made. If you purchase items to replace things in your delayed luggage, keep the receipts together in a safe place.International agreements may restrict the airline's liability. This means you won't get any more compensation than the liability ceiling set by the agreement.
However, that doesn't mean you should treat that ceiling as an excuse to go on a free shopping spree as long as you don't spend over that amount. The airline may contest your expenditures if they don't seem to fall in the range of necessity.
Be prepared to justify your expenses. Business attire, if necessary, can be expensive – especially if you have to buy something at the last minute within a short period of time. Other expenses, however, may be harder to explain.
For example, if you need to buy underwear and go to a discount store, you'll likely be fully reimbursed. However, don't expect the airline to reimburse your entire purchase at a luxury lingerie boutique.

, many air travelers purchase travel insurance to protect them in situations such as when baggage is lost or delayed by the airline. If you have travel insurance, you may have quicker results going through your insurance.In some situations (and depending on the contents of your bag), your homeowner's or renter's insurance also may cover the loss.
Keep in mind that typically the insurance company won't act until the situation has been resolved – meaning either you have your bag and the period of delay can be assessed, or the airline has notified you that your bag is lost entirely.

"
"
Track your claim.,
Ask the airline to deliver your luggage to you.,
Complete a claim form.,
Go up the chain of command.",How to Request Compensation for Delayed Airline Luggage3," Many airlines allow you to follow the progress of your baggage by plugging your claim number into an online app, or calling a toll-free number. Take advantage of these options to monitor the situation.Find out from the agent how to track the status of your claim before you leave the airport, and write down all contact information.
Make sure you provide a valid phone number that will work in your location. For example, if you're traveling in Europe, don't give the baggage agent your mobile phone number if your mobile phone company does not provide service in Europe.
Information about the status of your bag can change rapidly, particularly if a baggage agent initially classified your baggage as ""lost.""
Keeping up to date on any changes can help you continually assess the situation and determine the amount of compensation you may be due.

, It may be inconvenient or virtually impossible for you to make a return trip to the airport to pick up your delayed luggage once it gets there. Airlines typically will deliver it if you ask.If the airline has located your luggage and believes it will arrive at the airport within a few hours, they might encourage you to stay.
Keep in mind that even if you don't have set plans, it's okay not to go along with this. Most people aren't interested in hanging out at an airport for several hours, and the airline can't insist that you stay.
If you do decide to stay, ask the agent for meal vouchers or any other compensation the airline typically provides for passengers on delayed flights.
On the other hand, if you need (or want) to leave, you can insist that the airline deliver your luggage. Provide the agent with an address or the name of your hotel.
If you have to return to the airport to retrieve your luggage, you may be able to get the airline to compensate you for those travel expenses – particularly if you are away from home and had to take a cab to the airport.

, After you have your bags, get a written claim form from the airline and file it promptly. In many cases, you must file a claim within a week of your flight if you expect reimbursement.Don't be afraid to request compensation for the stress or inconvenience involved with the luggage delay. Maybe you missed a connecting flight, or had to alter your travel plans. Any costs you incurred as a result can be included in your claim.
You'll want to attach your receipts. Make copies of them beforehand if possible, so you can keep copies for your records – or ask the airline to make a copy of your entire claim.
If you're in the middle of a trip and unsure how to get copies, ask at the lobby of your hotel. You also can take photos of the receipts from a smart phone.
You'll also need your boarding pass to prove that you were on the plane, and any luggage labels (if you got a barcode ticket when you checked your bags).
Keep in mind that unless your baggage was delayed for more than 24 hours, you typically won't get reimbursement for anything beyond essentials.
In other words, if you needed to buy replacement clothing, don't expect reimbursement for the cost of those items if your bag showed up four hours later. However, if you had an important reason for doing so – for example, you were traveling for a business meeting that occurred soon after your flight landed – you have cause to insist that the airline reimburse you.

, If the baggage agent is unwilling to work with you, don't be afraid to accelerate your claim to their supervisor. Even if you're legally entitled to compensation for your delayed airline luggage, you may not get it without a fight.Review the international agreements or national regulations (in the case of U.S. domestic flights) that apply to your situation, and be ready to reference them to the airline representatives with whom you speak.
If you're not satisfied with the airline's response or its handling of your delayed luggage, consider filing a claim with a government regulatory agency. The agency with jurisdiction typically will be the one in the country where the airline is based, or where the delay occurred.
You also may have the option of suing the airline. In case of luggage that was merely delayed and that you ultimately recovered, however, this may be more trouble than it's worth.

Use flight search engines for budget airlines.,
Be flexible with your travel dates and times.,
Be flexible with your travel routes.,
Book your flight about seven weeks before your trip.,
Search for one-way ticket prices.",How to Choose a Low Cost Airline1," Familiarize yourself with the budget airlines available in your country so you can take advantage of flight search engines that cater to them. Flight search engines will provide airfare pricing for every budget airline that accommodates your travel dates/times. This allows you to easily comparison shop for the cheapest price.Use multiple flight search engines to make sure you don’t miss any additional results or cheaper fares. It is very common for prices to vary from search engine to search engine.Examples of these flight search engines include TripAdvisor and Expedia.;
, Budget airfare costs fluctuate depending on day of the week and time of year. Winter and summer are both busy times for flying. European travel peaks in the month of August. Airfare will cost the most during these busy times of year, so avoid them whenever possible.Fly during the middle of the week. Airfares tend to go up on the weekends.
The cheapest flights will have very early morning or very late evening departure times.
Flights tend cost a lot less immediately following major holidays.

, Nonstop flights are usually the most expensive options. Flights with connections may extend your travel time a bit, but they can be a far cheaper alternative. Be aware of the major cities surrounding your destination and look into flights landing there, too. Explore a variety of options before buying your flight.


For example, a nonstop flight to Amsterdam could be far more expensive than first flying to London, then taking a budget flight from there to Amsterdam.Don’t forget to check into regional airports, as well. The flight search engines rarely include these, but you might find some great prices. It’s definitely worth a look., While it’s not an exact science, data seems to indicate that about seven weeks before you intend to fly out is the best window for getting cheap airfare – for domestic travel and short haul flights only. Eighteen weeks ahead is the best time to shop for cheap rates for long haul destinations, such as flights that will take you over an ocean to another country.


Avoid waiting to book your flight at the last minute. Sometimes you can score a cheap flight by taking advantage of airlines trying to fill seats at the last minute. However, it's not a dependable strategy.

, Don’t limit yourself to round-trip flight searches only. With a little research, you may find that purchasing two one-way tickets is a cheaper deal. One budget airline may have a great price on a one-way flight to your destination, and an entirely different airline may offer a return one-way flight for a highly discounted price.


Don’t be afraid to shop around at different budget airlines and mix it up if it will save you money.If you use this technique, don’t forget about airport parking. Different airlines don't always use the same airports. Your return flight may land in an entirely different airport than the one you departed from.

Find out baggage policies and costs.,
Look for and take advantage of any discounts and/or special offers.,
Sign up for email alerts.,
Join frequent flier programs offered by budget airlines.,
Book your flights online.",How to Choose a Low Cost Airline2," Many budget airlines charge for every piece of luggage you travel with. Often this cost is not factored into the original price quote, which may be the reason why the flight looked so cheap at first. These fees are often tacked on to the total right before you check out.


Low-cost airlines often charge a specific amount for different bag sizes and weights, so read their policies carefully.Look out for airlines that limit how many pieces of luggage you are allowed to carry. Check into their policies and prices for carry-on baggage and personal items (such as a purse or backpack).

, Students under the age of 26 are often eligible for a variety of different discounts. Look for student discount codes when you're shopping on airline websites. Discounts and reduced fees are sometimes available for large families or groups booking flights.If you don't see anything listed online, you can always call the airline and ask them directly if any discounts are available to you., Visit a few budget airline websites and sign up for their email lists and newsletters. You will get information from each airline about flight sales, new routes with introductory rates and cheap fares on last minute flights, all delivered straight to your inbox. This can take a lot of the leg work out of hunting for the cheapest airfares.


Tuesday afternoons are a common time to receive email offers for last minute weekend flights, since airlines will know by then if the weekend flights are full yet.
If there are still a lot of empty seats, they often heavily discount the prices and send that information out to their email subscribers., Even if you only fly occasionally, you should still sign up for rewards programs. These programs allow you to collect “points” or “miles” each time you fly with that airline. Once you collect a certain amount of them, you are able to use these points or miles to pay for future flights and obtain other related discounts.Rewards programs are especially helpful to frequent flyers, since they are able to amass a large amount of points or miles fairly quickly, resulting in access to very cheap (or often free) airfare.

, It’s not unusual for low-cost airlines to provide discounted prices to those who purchase their airfare online. Call the airline and ask questions if you have them, but when you’re ready to actually purchase your flight, always do it on the airline’s website. Airlines typically advertise about current discounts and promotions on their homepage – if you call to book your flight, you may not be made aware of these offers.


Booking online also allows you to look over everything carefully before you purchase anything and easily opt out of hidden fees.

"
Watch out for hidden fees.,
Double check and follow the rules about luggage allowances.,
Be aware of what low-cost airlines don’t provide.Budget airlines are able to offer such cheap prices because they don’t offer the typical perks that major airlines provide.,
Learn everything you can about the budget airline.,
Get insight from reading customer testimonials and reviews.These can tell you a lot about what your flight experience may be like when you use a new budget airline.",How to Choose a Low Cost Airline3," Many low-cost airlines provide great pricing when you’re searching for flights, but then hit you with hidden fees when you're ready to pay. Search the airline’s website for possible hidden fees and read the fine print before you check out.Don’t click “buy now” to book your reservation until you’ve looked the page over carefully for any charges (like travel insurance) that are automatically tacked onto your total. Often you can opt out of these charges and save yourself some money.


Be aware of the airline’s cancellation policy – often there are fees associated with cancelling a flight.
If something looks too good to be true, it might be. If necessary, call the airline to confirm their fees.

, Budget airlines usually have very strict rules about baggage and breaking these rules can result in a significant amount of fees. Always weigh and measure your baggage before you leave for your flight – don’t try to guess or eyeball it. Make sure your baggage stays within the boundaries of these restrictions.Check their rules on how many pieces of luggage you are allowed to have, as well. Many budget airlines enforce a limit.

, The planes are older and the seats are usually smaller. You won’t have a lot of leg room. Low-cost airlines typically don’t provide complimentary food and beverages, wi-fi access or in-flight entertainment. Baggage rules are often very strict and can result in steep fees.


If you want to fly with a low-cost airline, you can’t expect the perks of a full-service flight.

, Before you make a purchase with an airline you are unfamiliar with, look into the airline’s safety record, record of maintenance issues, the frequency of on-time flights versus layovers and so on. There is more than one website out there dedicated to airline reviews and ratings. To explore an example of one of these sites, visit http://www.airlineratings.com.

, Testimonials and reviews will definitely let you know about any hidden fees that previous customers got stuck with, allowing you to avoid them more easily yourself. Keep in mind that reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.


However, look out for complaints that are repeated frequently by different customers – these grievances are most likely to be accurate.
Go to the airline's website and look for customer review/testimonial links. If you don't see anything like that, do a Google search for reviews on the airline you're interested in.

,  Since you're traveling alone, you don't want to be weighed down with 50+ pounds of luggage.  Pack a small suitcase or medium-sized bag with:


entertainment for the flight, such as books, colored pencils, a sketchpad or journal, headphones, etc.
any medication you might need, such as ibuprofen for headaches or a stomachache relief tablet
clothes and other important things (contacts, spare glasses, hearing aids, toothbrush) in case your luggage gets lost, delayed, or stolen
snacks (even if there will be a meal served)
gum, lollipops and hard candy or mints to suck on and relieve pressure and ear popping

, If you are blind, deaf, mute, in a wheelchair, etc., make sure a flight attendant on the plane is able to help you in case you need anything or would be able to assist you in the case of an evacuation.


If you are blind or physically limited in any way, make sure you can get to the lavatory easily.  If you can't, alert a flight attendant.  Some planes have flight-attendant alert cords to pull if you can't reach the alert button.

,  Be sure you can receive a call, place a call, or turn the phone on and off.  This is important for communicating with your parents and the person picking you up at the end of the flight.

,  Your bag may be the same as someone else's, but you will be able to tell yours from theirs if yours has a colorful ribbon tied around the handle, or a strip of polka-dot duct tape across the front.

,  Put your name on the tag of your sweater and inside your shoes.  This may prevent you from losing them and from people walking off with them.

,  Keep your ticket, cell phone, your passport, and any cash you're bringing in the purse.  Don't let it leave your side until you reach your destination.

,  Don't wear anything that will be removed for security but takes a long time to be put back on.


Girls, do not wear anything form-fitting.  You will be alone, and the airport is a very dangerous place for young girls.  Wear clothing that fits properly but does not show off any part of your body.

,  Be sure that your suitcase(s) is/are fixed with labels and left with airport employees.

,  If you were dropped off at the airport and are fending for yourself, make it look like you know where you are going and are determined to get there, even if you're not quite sure where to go.  Make a point of asking for help if you get lost.

, When you reach security, remove your shoes and sweater before you get to the line.  If possible, load all of your belongings into a bin and carry the bin to the line, to help you move through faster.


When you leave security, ensure that you have everything.

,  If you realize you forgot something, like gum, you can buy it at one of the convenience stores.  This might be a good time to buy breakfast or lunch if you haven't already and it isn't being served on the flight, or go to the bathroom.

,  Bring them into the bathroom stall with you and keep them right beside you in line for coffee or a magazine.

,  Pay attention to what the flight attendant is saying.  You don't want to miss your category.

, If someone on the flight is making you uncomfortable, don't hesitate to call a flight attendant.  You are, after all, an unaccompanied minor.

,  In case of an emergency, you need to know what to do.

,  Get a drink and a snack when the cart comes around.  If a meal is being served, eat it.  You don't want to be hungry or thirsty. That being said, listen to your body. If the food is gross and you get nauseous easily, pass on the meal and go for some pretzels and ginger ale instead.

,  Breathe deeply and try to sleep.  Distract yourself with books and other things to do.  Eat some pretzels.  Drink some soda.

,  Dispose of any garbage.  Make sure nothing is left behind.  Tie your shoes and put on your sweater even if you're feeling warm: you don't want to lose it.

,  If items up above shifted during the flight, you'll be safe from falling objects.

,  Inform them that you are off the plane and you will be at the baggage carousel.

,  Before taking up a spot beside a carousel, make sure it has the luggage from your flight, otherwise you'll be standing there for a long time.

, When you have your luggage, call the person meeting you again and ask them where they want to meet up with you.  Make your way there, or stay at the baggage claim and wait for them if they tell you to do so.


Don't leave with anyone that you don't recognize.

, While you are walking to meet them or waiting, call your parents and inform them that you landed safely and have all your luggage, and that you love them.  Parents really appreciate that last bit.

Book nonstop flights whenever you can.,
Fly in the middle of the week.,
Choose a morning flight instead of a later departure time.,
Use smaller airports.,
Obey all baggage and carry-on restrictions.,
Try not to fly during notoriously busy travel periods.",How to Avoid Flight Delays," If your flight makes a stop, or you need to rely on a connecting flight to get to your destination, there is a greater chance for a delay.


Pay attention to weather. If a connecting flight cannot be avoided, make sure you are not connecting in the Midwest during winter, or in the Gulf region during hurricane season.;
, Most airports have less traffic on Tuesdays and Wednesdays than they do during the beginning or end of a week. The lighter number of flights means your flight has a better chance of not getting stuck in traffic on the runway or in the sky.

, Flight delays tend to have a ripple effect. Therefore, flying early will diminish your chance of being late.


Ask for an originator flight. Most people book flights online, but it might help to call the airline and ask for help. Originator flights are those that begin at a specific airport at a specific time. These are the first flights out, and are often not delayed.
Try not to book the last or latest flight available. If that is delayed, you run the risk of having to stay overnight at the airport, or having your flight canceled.

, Flying in and out of major hubs, such as Chicago O'Hare and LAX in Los Angeles increases the chance of delays. In Chicago, use Midway and in Los Angeles, try Burbank.


Access resources with the National Air Traffic Controllers. Check out www.avoiddelays.com, which rates each airport for its timely departures and on time arrivals. Travel and Leisure and other publications also maintain lists of the best and worst airports to use.

, Avoid holding up your own flight by keeping your trip from the check-in desk to the boarding gate as smooth as possible.


Pack carry-on luggage loosely so it is easily scanned and searched.
Take off your shoes, coat and metal accessories while waiting in line at security. Keep your identification and boarding pass handy.

, Thanksgiving week, spring break periods and the week between Christmas and New Year's Day are busier than usual, and the chance for delays increases.

You made it to the airport.,
Find the computer screen (TV like) that will tell you where to check in.,
Get in the correct queue.,
Queue patiently, and when you arrive at the desk, greet the check-in clerk and hand over your flight ticket with your passport.

,
If you have any baggage to be checked in, after he/she has checked your documents, you will be asked to place these on the conveyor belt one at a time.,
Providing that your baggage is within the correct weight range, you will then say goodbye to your suitcase (until you land at your destination) and it will be labelled with an identification tag, which will have a code that matches one which will be stuck on your passport cover (to track your luggage) and other info like a ""HEAVY"" tag or ""TRANSFER AT"" tag.

,
The clerk will then give you back your flight ticket, passport and a boarding card with a seat number.

,
You should now proceed to security.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight!

",How to Check Into a UK Airport," This is probably one of the most important steps in this article. You need to arrive 2 hours before you are due to fly. Even if you know you are delayed, arrive before the time stated on your booking confirmation.;
, Now, before you head for check in, you should have to hand: - Your passport, your flight ticket, your booking confirmation (in case of a problem).

, At most UK Airports these will be signposted. Generally, each flight will have 2-3 check in desks to keep queues down.

, If you are unsure, ask an airport attendant.

,, NB: Most airlines charge for checking in baggage so please, to help yourself, check before you go. If it says 15kg, stick to 15kg. If it says 20kg, stick to 20kg or you may need to pay extra at check-in!

,,,, They will help you meet the requirements of that specific airport. However, 2 rules which are followed at all airports are: your carry-on baggage weighs no more than the specified weight (your airline will tell you once you have booked online), and that if you are taking liquids in your hand baggage, you place them in a resealable plastic bag, with only 100ml or less containers, making sure the bag is not to full. Take your coat off and if you have steel toe cap shoes take them off and put them through the X-ray. If you have a laptop or any other electronic items with you, take them and your liquids out of your bag and place them in a tray. Then when you are called to go through the scanner walk through at a steady pace. If it bleeps, you will be asked to step to the side and be metal detected and searched.

, Then check your boarding card which will show the time that you should be at the gate. It will also tell you which gate you should be at. If it doesn't, refer to the computer screens in security and the departures lounge which will tell you which gate to proceed to at what time (like the ones that told you which check-in desk. It usually says things like 'Wait in lounge' and 'Proceed to gate' or nothing usually until the run up to your flight.

, For special tax-free discounts, you will need to show your boarding card. (Please bear in mind that it can take up to 60 minutes to walk from one side of the airport to another depending on how large/busy it may be.) There may be shuttle services and there will be boards telling you where to go.

, There may or may not be a queue, so when you are asked to come forward, hand over your passport and boarding card, have them checked, and board the flight.

, Place any hand baggage in the correct overhead locker, or under the seat in front of you (under the seat in front of you is usually more convenient)

,, When asked to do so, pay close attention to the in-flight safety demonstration (this may be in-person or on a film). If you fall asleep keep your seat belt on and keep it visible at all times.

Pack a few light snacks.,
Bring along a bottle of water.,
Supply your own reading material.,
Make room for other essentials.",How to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses at the Airport1," Load up on packaged foods that you can munch on during the flight, or devour a large meal that you know will hold you over until you land. That way, you’ll be less tempted to make a stop at the food court, where the options tend to be quite pricey. If your appetite gets the best of you, seek out a vending machine or snack kiosk instead of a restaurant.Items like chips, granola bars, mixed nuts and candy make perfect snacks for flying.Airports can get away with charging exorbitant prices for food because they know many travelers have no other alternative.;
, Fill up a small portable container that you can bring on the flight with you or stash in your bag. This will prevent you from getting thirsty and having to order a drink on the plane. If you’re unable to have a beverage on standby, be sure to stop at a water fountain and drink your fill before you board.Consider carrying an empty bottle or two that you can refill once you’ve made it to your terminal.In some cases, you may only be permitted to pack a certain number of fluid ounces in your carry-on. If you exceed the regulated amount, you may be forced to simply throw your drinks away.

, The thought of facing a long flight with no means of entertainment can be cause for dread. Slip a book, magazine or newspaper into your carry-on so that you’ll have something to occupy yourself while you’re in the air. Travelers who are unprepared for boredom often find themselves forking over big bucks for novels in the airport bookstore.Take this opportunity to catch up on paperwork or journaling that you’ve been putting off.
You might also consider downloading eBooks to your smartphone or eReader device. This will present you with a wealth of literature right at your fingertips., While you’re at it, don’t forget about other practical necessities, such as earplugs, cold medicine, tissues and hand sanitizer. You can expect to pay more for these in airport convenience stores than you normally would. Basically, plan on reserving room for anything that you might end up having to purchase should you find yourself without it.Write out a checklist and go over it while you pack to make sure you’re not leaving behind anything important.

Economize on parking.,
Exchange currency in advance.,
Leave banned items at home.,
Avoid stores and gift shops.",How to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses at the Airport2," Everybody wants a coveted spot closest to their terminal, but these will almost always come at a high price. You’ll have better luck leaving your vehicle somewhere off-site and taking a short shuttle trip to get you where you need to be. Don’t forget to account for extra driving or walking time when scheduling your day.Look into online parking services like BestParking.com and LongTermParking.com that will help you locate the most convenient parking solutions in the area for little or no cost.
If possible, have a friend drop you off in time for your flight, or hire an Uber or Lyft driver. Both of these options are cheaper than airport parking.

, Rather than waiting until you get to the airport to swap out your money for a foreign currency, take it to a bank and have it done ahead of time. There, they’ll provide you with the currency you need without demanding outrageous service fees. This is especially helpful if you’re traveling on a budget.There may be charges for exchanging currency at a local bank, but they’ll rarely be as high as at the airport.Be sure that you convert enough money to pay for transportation and other basic services when you arrive in another country.

, Hygiene products and other belongings that don’t meet security requirements often go straight into the trash. You’ll then have no choice but to purchase replacements later, which can drain your wallet quicker than anticipated.Familiarize yourself with the types of items that are forbidden by the airline you’re flying with so you’ll be clear about what is and isn’t okay to bring.

, This is the culprit of most airport spending. It’s also the worst kind, because you’ll be losing money on things you don’t need. If you’ve got some time to kill before takeoff, use it to read, plan your itinerary or call your loved ones instead of window shopping.To be on the safe side, it’s often best to avoid temptation and stay out of airport stores altogether.
Get your souvenirs from small local shops after you reach your destination.

Book your flight at an opportune time.,
Take advantage of travel rewards.,
Don’t check a bag.,
Give up your seat.",How to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses at the Airport3," Do a little research to find out when airfare is least expensive and plan your trip around this window. It can also pay to compare rates and purchase one-way tickets for both your departing and returning flights, if you can save that way. Keep in mind that airfare is often lower outside of popular tourist seasons.Searching for flights weeks or even months before your actual travel date can help you land the best possible deal.
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays are generally the cheapest days of the week to fly—airplanes tend to be less crowded on these days., If you travel often or tend to use your credit card to pay for things, it’s possible that you’ve built up enough frequent flyer miles to enjoy a free (or significantly discounted) flight. Even if not, you might still be able to score snacks or other in-flight goodies. Accumulated perks can lighten your financial burden significantly, so it's best to use them when you have the chance.Check your points before booking your flight to see if you can cash in on some money-saving benefits.
Save your perks for a time you really need it, like an international flight or an emergency trip back home., Luggage fees account for a major part of most people’s travel costs. If possible, cram everything you need to bring along into a single carry-on bag that you can keep with you throughout the flight. Make it a larger suitcase or duffel bag to maximize the amount of space you have.Review the airline’s bylaws to see what their baggage policies are. Certain companies, most notably Southwest, allow patrons to check up to two bags without paying any fees.
Assuming you can’t get away with just one bag, keep your checked luggage under the maximum weight limit to avoid incurring additional fees., Airlines will sometimes offer incentives to selfless customers who are willing to take a hit so that a flight can depart on time. These include free or reduced airfare and hotel rates. It may be inconvenient, but it can save you a considerable amount of cash in the long run.This tradeoff will work best if you’re alone or traveling on a flexible schedule.
You might also be able to secure accommodation through the airline for flights with long layovers."

, While confirming your flight, you may have the option to choose meals for your flight. Be prepared to pay for them, since most domestic flights no longer include free meals. Each airline has slightly different food policies and options, so make sure you know what is available on your carrier.Contact the airline in advance if you have any unique dietary restrictions or food allergies. Call the airline directly or contact them via e-mail if you need special food or have severe food allergies so they will be prepared the day of the flight. There should be a number of options that are available for a variety of diets.
International flights often offer complimentary meals.

, Most airlines charge for both checked and carry-on luggage. Make sure to check-in and pay for all bags before heading to the airport. If you did not pay for checked or carry-on bags when making the initial flight reservation, you can pay for bags when checking in online for your flight, or at your airline’s service desk in the airport terminal.


If you know how many bags you will be checking, enter the number and pay for them ahead of departure with a credit card.
Checked and carry-on luggage is often more expensive in the 24 hours leading up to the flight than prior to that time period. Plan to pay all baggage fees well in advance.

, For most airlines, you can specify the seat type you prefer (window or aisle) or choose your specific seat, if a seat hasn’t already been assigned to you. Some airlines have individual fees for different types of seats, while others charge more for first-class seating or seats with extra leg room.


Most airlines will allow you to choose your seats ahead of time. Check in and find the seat that’s in the best location for your travel.

, If you are traveling with pets, make sure you’ve verified all details with the airlines beforehand. Flying with pets can be logistically difficult, and you’ll want to know that everything is ready when you arrive for your flight. Smaller pets can sometimes be taken as carry-ons. Verify your kennel meets the appropriate sizes and regulation for the airline. Larger animals cannot be carried on and need to be kept underneath the cabin.There are size requirements for both carry-on kennels and checked kennels. You can find these guidelines on your airline’s website or by calling the airline’s “Contact Us” number.
Make sure that you check in advance about any special weather restrictions. Airlines often have travel restrictions for pets based on the time of the year. Verify with your airline that you will meet the appropriate restrictions during the time of your flight."

Make sure to check-in all final baggage, seats, and pets online prior to your flight time.
Finalize all baggage, seats, and pets on your check-in. If you added them beforehand, verify that these special requests are all being honored by the airline.

, After you’ve checked your online check-in, you’ll be ready to complete the final check-in at the airport. Bring your driver’s license, passport, or other government-issued photo ID when you travel, as the airline will need to verify your identity. Airport terminals are busy places, so being ready to show the attendant all necessary documents will make sure you get through the line quickly and easily.


Print your flight confirmation or boarding pass at the terminal kiosk when you arrive at the airport. If you think you’ll be in a rush once you arrive at the airport, you can also print your boarding pass once you have checked in to your flight online., Make sure you have your checked luggage ready to give to the attendant at the terminal. Keep your luggage secure and ready to be kept under the plane. Before checking your luggage, verify that your checked luggage meets the weight requirements. Most airlines charge extra for luggage over 50 pounds.


Keep your luggage well marked and easy to locate. Much luggage looks the same. Do something to make your luggage distinctive so you’ll recognize it when you see it again at your arrival destination.

, If you’re traveling with pets, make sure your pets are secure and ready to travel in their kennel. They need to have been fed and be calm for the flight. Give yourself extra time to check your pets, so the attendant can verify your paperwork.Pets usually need to be a minimum age to fly. Most airlines suggest 6 to 8 weeks.
Small dogs and cats also need to have a health certificate issued by a vet close to the time of departure and arrival. How recent the health certificate needs to be depends on the airline.

, Small bags can be carried onto the plane. However, it is important that both meet the requirements for carry-on luggage and are easy to store in the cabin. Make sure your carry-on bag meets the size requirements. Most carry-on bags need to be able to fit into the overhead compartment. Airports usually have a measurement box so you can test out your baggage.


Verify that your baggage is not too heavy. Heavy baggage can make it difficult to maneuver around the plane and in the terminal.

, Small pets can also be carried on the plane, although they may need to be kept in a kennel under the seat in front of you. Verify also that your pet is calm and ready to fly. You don’t want to have a noisy pet when you come onto the airplane. Noisy pets make for a long and annoying plane ride for your fellow passengers.

Before boarding, make sure your pet kennel meets the required size and weight requirements. You can find the size and weight requirements on your airline’s website.

Unscrew the brake lever to move it up, down or to the side of the handlebar if needed. Screw it back tightly into place.

, Clean your hands with soap and water. You may wear gloves to keep from getting the tape dirty., Secure any cables that run along the handlebars with strapping tape or electrical tape. Some bikes feature cables that run along the handlebars to the brake pads. This cable system allows you to brake the bike with your hands instead of using the pedals to come to a stop.,

Remove the brake hood. The brake hood lies on top of the brake lever and protects it from damage.
Detach the two short pieces of tape that typically come with a new roll of handlebar tape.
Place each one of the strips over the back of each brake lever.
Bring the tape up around the brake lever.
Wrap the break lever a few more times.
Replace the brake hood.

,

Attach the beginning of the roll of tape to the bottom end of the handlebar. Keep some extra tape loose at the end of the bar.
Wrap the tape around the handlebar. Move up the curve and along the flat part of the bar towards the center of the handlebars.
Wrap in a counter-clockwise direction on the right handle and a clockwise direction on the left handle.
Keep the tape tight as you wrap. Do not pull so hard that you wrinkle the tape or tear it.
Overlap each pass slightly as you continue taping. Make sure all spots are taped.
Wrap past the brake lever. You have already taped the levers with the smaller portions of tape.

,

Cut the bar tape with scissors. Stop wrapping the tape as close to the middle of the handlebars as desired.
Wrap electrical tape around the end of the bike tape and the bar. Ensure that the electrical tape sticks to the bar.

,

Place the remaining tape at the end of the curved part of the handlebar into the hole at the end of the bar.
Insert the bar plug into the hole at the end of the bar.

Maintain a healthy diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Take a supplement.,
Get a flu shot.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Avoid Germs on an Airplane1," One of the easiest ways to keep from getting sick on a plane is to make sure that your immune system is working optimally before you board. Eating a healthy diet will boost your immune system and make sure that your body is ready to combat the germs waiting on the plane. Make sure that you are eating lots of whole grains as well as fruits and vegetables.Healthy foods include things like apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, carrots, broccoli, spinach, avocados, as well as rice and other whole grains.
Avoid saturated fats and try to eat leans proteins like fish and nuts.;
, In order to boost your immune system, make sure that you drink enough water. On average, a man should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) and a woman should drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water.Maintaining proper hydration will ensure that your immune system is strong and prevent the cold or flu.

, A number of different vitamins and minerals may help boost your immune system, although it has not been proven that they can keep you from becoming sick. Take a daily multivitamin to ensure that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need.


Be sure to talk with your doctor about taking any supplements.

, A flu shot is one of the best preventive measures that you can take to keep from getting sick. The shot will boost your body’s production of antibodies that protect against the various strains of influenza virus. In order for the vaccine to protect you on a flight, you should get it at least two weeks before you travel.Talk with your doctor about getting a flu shot, especially if you have an allergy to eggs or any of the ingredients in the vaccine or if you have ever had Guillain-Barre Syndrome., To keep your immune system strong, you should regularly get at least eight hours of sleep a night. It is not enough to get a good night’s sleep just before you fly. You need to develop a habit of consistently sleeping eight hours. This will ensure that your immune system is operating optimally before you fly.If you want to sleep better, make sure that you establish a regular bedtime and stick to it. You should also try to get up at the same time every day.
Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, or pop before bed.
Limit your screen time before bed. Try not to watch TV or look at your phone right before you go to bed.
Get plenty of physical activity each day. Getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise will help you sleep better at night.

Wear a mask.,
Keep your hands clean.,
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.,
Stay hydrated.,
Allow for air circulation.",How to Avoid Germs on an Airplane2," If you are sitting next to someone who appears sick, a mask may prevent you from catching an airborne illness. A mask is particularly effective against the cold, which is commonly transmitted through the air. Be sure to use a mask that covers your nose and mouth.You can find surgical masks at your local pharmacy.

, Because your hands will encounter many germ-covered surfaces in an airplane, you will need to wash them regularly. The best way to prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms is to scrub your hands with soap and running water for at least 15 seconds and dry thoroughly with a paper towel. However, you can also use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol.You should wash your hands after going to the bathroom or before eating food.
You may also want to use disinfectant wipes.

, These areas are the easiest access points for microorganisms looking to enter your body. Although washing your hands will remove many of the germs looking to enter your body, it will not get them all. In order to keep from getting sick, you should generally try to keep from touching your eyes, nose and mouth., The air on an airplane can be 55 percent drier than in a normal indoor setting. This can severely dry out the protective membranes in your sinuses. This makes your more susceptible to catching a cold or developing a sinus infection. To prevent this, you should drink plenty of water during the flight and use a hydrating nasal spray.Because airplane tap water can have high levels of bacteria, try to drink bottled water on your flight and avoid brushing teeth using the bathroom tap water.
Avoid drinking coffee, tea or alcohol. These diuretics will further dehydrate you.
Use a saline nasal spray before and after your flight to keep mucus membranes moist., Regular airflow helps prevent the circulation of airborne illnesses, so be sure to have your vents running. The HEPA filters on most planes filter out nearly 99.9 percent of airborne particles. Airplanes also circulate fresh air from outside into the cabin’s mixture."
"
Bring your own stuff.,
Order a hot meal.,
Change your seat.,
Try not to directly touch anything.",How to Avoid Germs on an Airplane3," If you are going on a long flight, try to bring your own blankets, pillows, headphones, and entertainment. Airlines wash blankets and pillows infrequently. Unless you are flying right after they are washed, you are likely using things that other people have used and covered with their germs., If it is an option, try to order a hot meal during your flight. Properly heating your food will kill any germs that might make you sick. If a warm meal is not an option, consider bringing your own snacks or foods.Prepackaged snacks like crackers, pretzels, and nuts should be fine.

, If you are sitting next to someone who is ill, ask a flight attendant if you can change seats. Sitting in close proximity to someone who is ill increases your chances of getting sick by nearly 10 percent. Aisle seats are also dangerous because of the high amount of foot traffic. If the plane is not full, you may be able to sit somewhere else.Say something like “Do you mind if I switch seats?” or “Is it possible if I switch seats?”
If moving is not an option, you should consider wearing a mask or asking if the sick person would mind wearing a mask.

, Because hundreds of people will pass through a plane on a given day, almost every surface in the plane may be covered in germs. This is particularly true of the bathrooms, tray tables, and armrests. If you can, use a tissue or paper towel when touching things on the airplane and always wash your hands.Do not store your things in the seat-back pouch because this area may harbor bacteria due to people storing tissues and sick bags here.

Finding a box: Locate a proper cardboard bicycle box.,
Calculating the cost: Measure the length, height and depth of your box.,
Bicycles can also be shipped from Amtrak Express which delivers them from station to station.,
Trimming the box (if needed): Cut two or three inch slots into the four corners of the open end of the box (between the flaps).,
Test fit: It's best to conduct a few test fits.,
Finished.

",How to Ship a Bicycle Cheaply1," Local bicycle shops will usually give away bicycle shipping boxes. (Occasionally they charge a nominal fee, no more than $5.) When picking up a box ask for a smaller size - this will help you save on shipping.;
, Plug these numbers into the shipping calculators at websites such as http://www.FedEx.com and http://www.UPS.com along with the shipping address for the bicycle. A safe estimate for the package weight is usually around 35lbs. If you're lucky, the bicycle box measures under the ""dimensional weight"" restrictions of the carriers. If you notice an extra $25 or $35 dollar charge in the estimate you'll need to trim your bicycle box.

, They must be securely packed in boxes and boxes can also be purchased at the stations. Visit http://www.amtrak.com for more details.

, Fold the flaps inward (you'll have to trim the long flaps) and take down your new measurements. The length and depth will have remained the same, but the height of your box is now less - with luck the box now comes in under the size restriction and the $25 or $35 additional charge is gone. If the box is still large try to trim it again removing an additional two or three inches from the height.

, In order to fit the bicycle into a smaller box, you may need to remove one or both of the wheels, pedals, seat post, or possibly even the handlebars if by loosening the stem and turning the handlebars sideways will not work.

Know that, in general, you must take apart your bike before you can ship it.,
Remove the pedals with a pedal wrench.,
Remove the wheels.,
Remove the faceplate on the handlebars to take them off.,
Pull out the seat.,
Take off any extraneous features.",How to Ship a Bicycle Cheaply2," There are very few services that will ship a bike whole, and they are generally expensive. Luckily, taking apart your bike is pretty easy overall, and doesn't require a lot of mechanical knowledge.


Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty, as there is a good chance you'll get grease on you as you work.
Put the bike in a bike stand, or turn it upside down to remove everything but the handlebars.

, In a pinch, a normal adjustable wrench will do as well. Attach the wrench on the hexagonal bolt where pedal meets the crank arm to unscrew the pedal. However, each pedal unscrews in a different direction:


The drive-side pedal (by your gears) unscrews normally, counter-clockwise.
The opposite pedal unscrews in reverse, so you must turn clockwise.
Some pedals have an allen bolt on the outside edge that you can unscrew, instead of needing a pedal wrench.

, Most wheels have a small lever in the center that you simply lift up to unlock. From there, you may need to unscrew this part (known as the skewer) to get the wheel off. Simply hold the skewer on one side while you loosen the other side (counter-clockwise, or ""lefty loosey"") until the wheel is easily removed.


Shift your gears into the smallest ring in the back in order to easily get the chain out the way of the back wheel.
You may need to unhook your breaks in order to get the wheel off, or deflate your tires.

, The faceplate is the small, square, metal piece attaching your handlebars to your stem. You can see it in the center of your handlebars when you look at the bike straight on. There are four screws that are easily removed with an Allen key.


Do not jerk the handlebars or let the fall rapidly, or they may stress the brake and derailleur cables that are still attached.
Reattach the faceplate when you are done so that you don't lose it or the screws.

, Most seats are attached with a quick release -- the same small lever your might find on your wheel. If not, there is a small bolt where the seat post meets the frame that you can quickly unscrew to pull the entire seat post out.

, Mudflaps, water bottle cages, lights, etc. can get in the way of a tight pack job. You can, however, simply place them back in the box with the frame, as they will fit in the many spaces you still have left in the box.

"
Know that you must buy the right frame for your style of riding.,
Take your inseam measurement, the most important bike measurement there is.,
Use your inseam to calculate seat post length for road bikes.,
Use your inseam to find the proper length of your top tube for mountain bikers.Multiply your inseam (in inches) by .67, then subtract 4"" to 5"" from the answer to get the length of your top tube.Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible if you are a mountain biker, as seat tube (pedals to seat) measurements are tricky and change from manufacturer to manufacturer.For example, if you have a 33 inch inseam, you would need a 17.5"" top tube (17.75"" tubes are hard to find):33"" x .67 = 21.75""
21.75"" - 4"" = 17.75


Specialty bike makers Lapierre & NeilPryde have different geometry that requires different calculations.,
Use wheel diameter to help purchase children's bikes.,
Adjust the seat height to fit your legs before testing a bike frame.,
Find the ""reach"" that is most comfortable for you.,
Test out your suggested frame size before buying.,
Use an online sizing guide if you cannot test out bikes.,
Remember that your comfort comes first.",How to Size a Bike1," The frame is the metal body of the bike, and, unlike the handlebars, saddle, and pedals, it is not adjustable. Thus, buying the proper frame is the most important thing you can do when shopping for a bike. There is a variety of frames available on the market, but the frame shape generally changes based on the type of riding the bike is made for. Know, however, that there are as many different frame configurations as there are bike makers, each with ""specialized"" functions. However, the general shape of the bike helps determine it's function more often than not:



Road bikes are most often used by commuters, fitness, and racing fitness riding. The frames are usually large, isosceles (all sides the same length) triangles with a top bar, or top tube, that is parallel to the ground. Racing bikes usually have smaller frames, while touring or commuter bikes often have larger frames. Road bike frame sizes are measured in centimeters.

Mountain bikes have a lower center of gravity to keep you on balance riding over roots, rocks, and mud on the trail. The center triangle is more compact, with the top tube angling down, away from the handlebars. Mountain bike frame sizes are measured in inches.

Cruiser bikes have odd, sideways S-shaped or curved frames that allow you to sit nearly upright while riding. The handlebars are high above the seat and the pedals slightly in front of you so that you comfortably cruise around town. Sometimes called ""city bikes"" or ""commuter bikes,"" these are made for short distances. Fitting these bikes is less about measurements than pure comfort on a test ride.Kids bikes have smaller frames similar to mountain bikes, helping them keep their balance with a lower center of gravity. They are very adjustable to compensate for quickly growing kids. They are usually measured by wheel size.;
, Stand with your feet 6 inches apart, then measure from the inside of your foot up to your crotch, where your leg meets your waist. Think of the seam on the inside of a pair of jeans. You need to measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to where your seat should be. If you are sizing a mountain bike, measure in inches. If you are sizing a road bike, measure in centimeters. For the most precise measurement:


Take a thick, hardcover book and ""sit"" on the spine as if it was your bike seat.
Still standing, measure to the top of the book from the floor.

, Multiply your inseam measurement, in centimeters, by .67 to get your suggested seat tube (bar reaching from seat to pedals) length.The seat tube is usually, though not always, measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft.Know that this measurement is simply a starting point -- you will likely need to make specific adjustments later on.

, Multiply by .62 instead of .67 if you are getting one of these bikes.Some mountain bikers prefer to measure by seat tube length, like road bikers. If your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length, take your inseam and multiply it by .185. The resulting number is the recommended distance between your seat and the middle of the crankshaft, which is the circular piece the pedal rotates on., Most kid bikes are adjustable, accommodating random growth spurts so you don't need to buy a new bike every year. That said, a child's bike should still fit them so that it is safe and easy to ride.



Child's height is 28-38 inches: 12-inch wheels

Child's height is 38-48 inches: 16-inch wheels

Child's height is 48-60 inches: 20-inch wheels, The height of the seat is easily modified on a bike to fit you, and the right size frame will feel wrong if the seat isn't high enough. You want to have it raised so that, on the bottom of your pedal stroke (one foot is at the lowest point), your knee is slightly bent, not straight. Have a friend or someone at the bike shop hold the bike in place while you get on. Pedal backward, stopping with one foot at the very bottom of the pedal's rotation, and adjust your seat height so that it is slightly bent.It is very rare that the last person who tested the bike needed the same seat height as you, so you must adjust this before claiming the frame is the wrong size.
Make sure you are not shifting or dropping your hips with each pedal stroke, as this will make your foot drop lower than it should and result in an improper fit., There are a lot of measurement out there for finding the proper length between your seat and the handlebars, but they all end with the same advice -- pick one that you're comfortable with. At the end of the day, you'll feel like the reach to the handlebars is right if:


You can touch every shifter and breaks comfortably.
Your elbows are slightly bent.
You can bend from the waist, not the back, to reach down.
In general, casual riders will want closer, higher handlebars while racers want a longer reach., Everyone's body is a little different, and the proportions of your arms, legs, and torso might mean you need a different frame to feel comfortable. Use your inseam measurements to get a starting frame size, then go to a local bike shop and test it out. Then test out a size bigger and size smaller. If you are in between sizes that both feel comfortable, think about your riding style:


Smaller bikes are generally lighter and a bit more maneuverable. However, this difference is negligible, and you might not be able to adjust the bike a size if you find yourself uncomfortable later on. Many mountain bikers and racers opt for the smaller frame.
Larger bikes can make you reach a bit too far, but you can often raise and lower the handlebars to a greater degree, allowing you better customization options if you decide you need a better fit further down the road. Many road bikers chose the larger bike for a more comfortable fit.

, While they are far from perfect, since they cannot possibly account for your unique body type, sizing guides are useful nonetheless for sizing a frame. You can find them online with a quick internet search for ""(Mountain/Road/Kids/BMX/etc.) Frame Sizing Guide."" Most of them require you to input your height and inseam, as well as your riding style. They then give you a range of frames to try out., Everyone is different, so if you don't feel comfortable riding a bike the ""should"" fit you, you need to get it re-sized. Test a few different frame sizes before buying, and feel free to play with the seat and handlebars until your find your sweet spot.


Rent a few bikes before buying so that you can get 2-3 days of riding in.
Talk to you local bike staff, even if you might buy a bike online. Let them know about any specific issues you've had and possible reasons."

Calculate total reach.",How to Size a Road Bike1," Choose a C-C or C-T frame.;
,

Stand with your back against a wall.






Place your feet 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) apart.






Stand a book upright between your legs. The spine of the book should face away from the wall. The other edge of the book should touch the wall.






Lift the book to your crotch. You should feel as if you are seated on a bicycle saddle.






Get an assistant to measure the distance between the top of the book and the ground. This is your inseam.







,

Multiply your inseam measurement by .65 if you have a C-C frame. If your inseam measurement is 30 inches (76.2 cm), the result is 19.5 inches (49.5 cm). Your frame should be as near to 19.5 inches (49.5 cm) as possible.






Multiple your inseam measurement by .67 if you have a C-T frame. If your inseam measurement is 30 inches (76.2 cm), the result is 20.1 inches (51.1 cm). Your frame should be as near to 20.1 inches (51.1 cm) as possible.







, Total reach indicates how far you should stretch horizontally over the bike from the seat to the handlebars. A measurement of total reach denotes the distance from one end of the top stem, or crossbar, to the tube where the handlebars attach to the bike.

Stand with your back against a wall.






Hold a pencil. Make a fist around the pencil.






Hold your arm straight out at your side. Your arm should be parallel to the ground.






Get an assistant to use a tape measure to determine the length between the point on your collarbone nearest to your shoulder and the pencil. This is your arm length.






Stand a book upright between your legs. The spine of the book should face away from the wall. The other edge of the book should touch the wall.






Lift the book to your crotch.






Get an assistant to use a tape measure to determine the length between the top of the book and the hollow in your neck, just below the Adam's apple. This is your torso length.






Add arm length to torso length. An arm length of 24 inches (61 cm) and a torso length of 24 inches (61 cm) will give you a total of 48 inches (122 cm).






Divide the total by 2. A total of 48 inches (122 cm) gives you 24 inches (61 cm).






Add 4 inches (10.2 cm) to that number. You now have 28 inches (71.2 cm). From one end of the top stem to the tube where the handlebars attach to the frame, your bike should measure as close to 28 inches (71.2 cm) as possible.

Know that you must adjust the seat and handlebars to truly size a bike.,
Make minor adjustments to your seat height if you feel knee pain.,
Adjust how far forward the seat is to change your distance to the handlebars.,
Start with your seat angle leveled evenly with the ground.,
Adjust your handlebars to ride comfortably.",How to Size a Bike2," Getting the right frame size is only one part of sizing a bike correctly. Think of sizing measurements as your first draft -- it is the basis for everything that follows, but you need to make finer adjustments to get everything right.

, While you should set your seat before you buy a bike, making finer adjustments is crucial to comfortable sizing. Remember to pedal with the balls of your feet and don't swing your hips up and down with each stroke.


If you feel pain in the back of your knee when riding, your seat is too high. Lower it 1-2cm.
If you feel pain in the front of your knee when riding, your seat is too low. Raise it 1-2cm., Loosen the bolt underneath the back of the seat to move the seat forward or backward several centimeters. Make sure the seat is far enough forward for you for you to reach the handlebars comfortably.If your seat is in the right position, you will be able to stand on the pedals without using the handlebars to pull you up.
If you have trouble standing, reaching for the bars, or feel finger numbness, then your seat is too far back.
Trouble riding down hills and/or shoulder pain usually means your seat is too far forward., Use a carpenter's level to make sure the seat is flat, as this ensures even distribution of your weight. While some people believe a seat should be tilted up, a level seat is almost always the best starting point. However, if you experience crotch discomfort, you can try:


Women typically tilt the seat down for comfort.
Men typically tilt the seat up for comfort.Loosen the bolt on the side of the seat to change the seat angle. You can easily loosen the bolt, change the angle, then tighten again. Some older seats have two small bolts underneath the seat, one in front of the seat post and one behind. You must tighten one side to push that side up while loosening the other, almost like a see-saw., You want to ride in a way that's comfortable for you, and that changes from person to person. You want to feel in control of the bike without lower back pain. Most beginner riders want the handlebars to be even with saddle, or 1-2"" lower for racers and mountain bikers. You elbows should be slightly bent and your fingers light on the handlebars -- they could freely play the piano if there was one there. The position of your handlebars is determined by four things:



Top Tube Length refers to the length of the bar between your handlebars and seat. These are adjusted to fit the frame, and unless you have a very disproportionate body (torso much larger/smaller than legs) getting a properly sized frame will give you a properly sized top-tube.

Stem length is the distance between your top tube and the handlebars. The longer the stem, the further away the bars will be from your seat. Stems run from $15-$150 and are the primary way to adjust your frame to make it fit your torso. Longer stems bend you into a more aerodynamic position while shorter stems lead to a more upright, calmer riding style.Handlebar angle can be changed independently from your stem. To do so, loosen the 4 bolts where the stem meets the handlebars and angle it up or down to your comfort. This is a great way to get an extra 1-3 inches on your handlebar position, which can make a big difference in comfort.

Handlebar height can only be changed by adding or removing the metal spacers where your stem meets your frame. To do so, loosen the bolt on the top of the stem and the two that clamp the stem to your frame and remove the handlebars. Then add or remove the spacers accordingly. You can only make minor changes, however, as there is not a lot of room for new spacers.

Search for a bike shape that fits you.,
Select a comfortable saddle.,
Wear tight clothing that fits you well.,
Choose a helmet to wear.",How to Ride a Road Bike," The saddle of a road bike is adjustable to your height. Stand up straight beside the bike, holding it steady. Raise or lower the saddle so it is level with your hips. Sit on the saddle and straighten one leg on the pedal. If you can do it, then the saddle is at the right height.With the seat adjusted properly, you should be able to extend each leg and pedal without rocking to either side.;
, Before you climb onto the saddle, position the pedal closest to you in the downward position. This puts the farther pedal in the higher position. When you climb on, place your foot onto the higher pedal.This is the most useful position to start riding because it allows you to smoothly mount and push into a downward stroke of the pedal.
It’s okay to position the closer pedal up if you want, just as long as one is up and one is down.

, Your neck should not be tense, but don’t hang your head down either. It’s important to be looking ahead of you for safety reasons, but also so your neck is comfortable. Extend your neck and slightly lower your chin.

Use your peripheral vision to check the sides.
Gently move your head around sometimes so your neck doesn’t stiffen up.

, Avoid hunching forward with your shoulders tensed up. Let them hang and shrug them every so often to loosen them again. Learn to tell yourself on occasion to loosen your shoulders, as you’ll probably tense them over time.Your neck and shoulders are closely connected, so tilt your head to each side when you shrug your shoulders to loosen any tension in the neck muscles.

, You’ll be tempted to straighten your elbows sometimes, but this puts extra tension on your arm muscles. Keep the elbows close to your body rather than splayed out. Bent elbows also help absorb the shock of bumps, which can injure you if you keep your arms locked straight., Similar to how you must relax your shoulders, it’s important to lengthen your spine rather than hunch it. With your shoulders relaxed, push your chest out slightly so your back is straightened. Remind yourself as you ride to straighten your back if it begins to hunch forward., Position yourself forward or backward on the saddle so there is a vertical line from your knees to your feet. If your knees are too far forward, then scoot back. If your knees are behind your feet, scoot forward. Keep your knees directly above your feet., Resist the urge to bow your knees outward. It makes your pedaling less efficient and puts more strain on your knees. Drive the pedals straight downward and pull your knees straight upward as you cycle., Road bike handlebars offer three main positions, with the lower curved portion being called the drops. Holding them shifts more of your weight onto the front wheel, which helps balance the bike when you’re heading downhill.Holding onto the drops lowers your upper body, which creates better aerodynamics, as well.

, You may be traveling at high speeds on your road bike, but you’ll want to slow down for some corners. Braking during a turn can cause you to skid and wreck, so check your speed before a turn. Slow down on straightaways while your bike is straight up.The same point applies to stops. Begin braking early so you don’t have to squeeze your brakes hard for a sudden stop.

, You may think it’s best to ride so you can see the oncoming traffic, but riding with the traffic is safer. Stay as far to the right as you can, and ride on the shoulder of the road if the surface is smooth enough., It’s important to always watch for drivers, other riders, and pedestrians as you ride. Check behind you when you are changing lanes or turning. Watch out for parked cars, road construction, or other obstacles. Seeing what’s ahead of you will give you more time to react to it., Shift your back gears as you speed up. Shift your front gears as the terrain changes, like at the bottom of hill you’re about to ride up. Remember that the left shifter changes the larger cogs by your pedals. The right shifter changes the smaller cogs on the back wheel., Bikes have different shapes and sizes, just like people do. If you have the option, go to a bike shop and work with the bike pro to find the right fit. You want it to be tall enough for you, with handlebars that are at the right height. Test some bikes out to see how they feel when you ride them.An improperly fitted bike will cause you to hunch forward too much or make your legs feel cramped.

, You’ll mostly be sitting on the bike when you ride it, so a saddle, or seat, that feels comfortable to you is important. There are different saddle designs for men and women, as well as ones that are streamlined or wider. Test saddles in a bike store to see what feels best to you.Your budget affects the saddle that you’ll choose. If you want to stick with the cheap option that comes with the bike, feel free.
Saddles can be supplemented with pads or a cushion, as long as it doesn’t hinder your ability to ride the bike smoothly.

, The clothes you wear help you ride comfortably and efficiently. It’s good to wear tight clothes so you reduce friction from the wind. Tight clothes are less likely to get caught in the chains. Clothes designed for cycling are ideal over casual clothes.Make sure you choose an outfit that fits you, because if it is too tight you won’t be comfortable.

, Since your head is most at risk if you crash, always wear a helmet when you ride. Make sure it fits the shape of your head well, is padded the way you like, and looks stylish to you. Tighten the helmet so it fits snugly on your head when you ride.Many helmets can be adjusted in various ways, so pick one that is flexible.
Style may not seem important to you, but if you buy a helmet that you think looks dumb, you’ll never want to wear it. Find a helmet that you feel good about wearing.

This can increase your efficiency on the bike by up to 30% and is the easiest way to really make a big difference to your ride. Replacing slick road bike tyres with wider touring/hybrid tyres will increase grip in poor weather and make the ride more comfortable.;
, Touring with anything on your back can make you tired more easily and give you chafing and blisters. Installing a rack on your bike and using pannier bags gives you more freedom when you ride. Most mountain bikes will have the necessary bolt holes in the frame but many road bikes will not. You can purchase pannier racks that mount onto the seat post to overcome this problem, or you can try to bodge a few holes, be careful though!

, If you are using a mountain bike and have suspension with a lock out option, use it. Suspension absorbs some of your pedal energy which could be transferred to the wheels, better still change your suspension for for rigid ones to save on weight.

, Riding in the rain is unpleasant at the best of times, this can become unbearable if you don't have any mudguards. Water can also flick up from the back wheel onto your panniers causing them to become saturated. It's also much nicer for anyone riding behind you!

, This will give you a better range of riding positions for your tour. Cycling all day in the same position can take its toll on your body, changing position throughout the day will reduce the chances of aches and pains.

, These will add some extra power to your peddling motion and help keep your feet in the right place.

Don't give up!",How to Ride a Bike Without Training Wheels1," You should ‘’always’’ wear a helmet when you’re on your bike, but you might also want to wear other pieces of safety gear too! These make it less scary when you try to ride without training wheels. Since safety gear keeps you from getting hurt, you won’t be as nervous of falling off your bike or crashing. Here are some things you might want to wear the first time you try to ride without training wheels:


Elbow pads
Knee pads
Wrist guards;
, Bikes are less scary to ride when you know that you can stop yourself. Before you take your training wheels off, get on your bike and try to touch the ground with your feet. If you can’t reach, get a grown-up to help you lower the seat.


It’s OK if you can’t touch the ground with both feet at once when you're sitting on the seat — you only need one to stop yourself when you're sitting down. You should be able to touch the ground with both feet when you're standing in front of the seat, though.

, Bring your bike to a place that’s wide, open, and flat, like a park or a parking lot. Someplace with soft grass is best — it doesn’t hurt to fall on grass, so it’s not scary to practice riding on it. You can practice by yourself, but it’s easier if you have a friend or grown-up to help you!


If your bike still has its training wheels on, get a grown-up to take them off before you go to the place where you’ll ride.

, Sit on your bike and hold yourself up by putting your feet on the ground. Put one foot on the pedal and push down! Push yourself forward with your other foot at the same time. Put both of your feet on the pedals and keep pedalling! If you need to stop, pedal backwards (unless your bike has a hand brake — then just squeeze it with your fingers).


Don’t be afraid to put down your feet if you need to! The first few times you practice pedaling, it can feel like you’re going to fall, so don’t worry about stopping and putting your feet on the ground when you have to.

, When you have the hang of starting and stopping, try going left and right. While you’re pedalling forward, turn the handlebars just a tiny bit to the right. You should go to the right. Next, turn the just a little to the left. You should go to the left. Try turning a little more to each side — see how far you can turn without feeling uncomfortable. Don’t be afraid to stop yourself if you have a hard time turning!


It's actually harder to turn when you're going really slow than when you're going really fast. When you're barely moving at all, balancing is tricky, so if you're having a hard time turning, try going a little faster.

, Next, find a small hill or slope. Try pedalling up it — you'll need to push a little harder than normal to get to the top! When you're at the top, try going down slowly. Use your brakes to keep slow. When you're at the bottom, go up again, and this time, go a little faster. Do this again and again until you can go down the hill without using your brakes.


Be patient! It can take a while until you're able to go down a hill without stopping, so don't worry if you can't do it the first time you try.
Start out with small hills. Don't try to ride down big hills until you're good at riding without training wheels.

, It's a lot easier to learn how to ride without training wheels if you have someone with you to help out. Try asking a parent, a friend who can ride without training wheels, or your brother or sister to give you a hand if you can. These people can make it easier to learn in a lot of ways, but one of the best ways they can help is by running next to you and holding you up until you can pedal on your own.

, Learning how to ride without training wheels can be scary, but once you can do it, riding a bike is a lot more fun. If you can't ride without training wheels after the first day of practice, don't worry — you'll get it eventually! Try again with the help of a friend or grown-up when you have the chance. Never give up — riding without training wheels is something almost everyone has to learn how to do. Each time you practice, riding should get easier and easier until it's the only way you can ride!

Check the tire pressure.Why?,
Check your chain lube.Why?,
Check your brakes.Why?,
Check your clipless pedals, if you have them.Why?,
Feel for loose parts.Why?,
Listen for unusual noises.Why?",How to Perform a Daily Bike Safety and Maintenance Check," Riding on under-inflated tires can cause flats and damage your wheels. And pumping up tires is a lot easier than fixing bent wheels.How? It's hard to tell with your thumb if a tire is under-inflated, especially on narrower, higher pressure tires. Instead, use a pressure gauge or a floor pump with one built in. You will find the correct pressure printed or embossed on the sidewall of the tire.What if there's a problem? It's good to know how to change a tube or tire yourself. If you're not sure, have a mechanic at your local shop give you a quick lesson. Rear wheels can be a little tricky to remove and install because of the chain & derailleurs.Mechanic's Tip: Don't just throw a new tube into the tire without finding out what caused the flat. If the sharp object is still stuck in your tire, it will just result in yet another flat tube.Safety Pointer: Under-inflated or over-inflated tires can both cause accidents, though it's more common with under inflation. Under-inflated tires also make you pedal harder.;
, Riding with a dry chain wears the chain's moving parts out faster. This, in turn, wears out everything else on your drive train faster: cassette, chain rings, even the little pulleys on your derailleurHow? Before throwing a leg over the bike, back-pedal a half-revolution and listen for squeaking from your chain. If it's squeaky, looks dry, or even if it's just been a while since you lubed it last, take a second to apply some fresh oil to the chain.What if there's a problem? Steady a drip bottle of chain lube so that it's just above the chain, then backpedal through three or four revolutions while gently squeezing the lube out onto the top, not the sides, of the chain. If you don't want to get messy, a local shop will usually do it for a dollar or two. They can also tell you what oil to use in your locale.Mechanic's Tip: Every climate has its own best chain lube. Those living near the sea might want something not too far removed from motor oil, while those living in a drier climate might favor fairly thin lubricants that don't attract too much dust. But WD-40, Liquid Wrench and similar ""penetrants"" are never a good idea.Safety Pointer: Don't use aerosols, as the overspray can get on the rim and interfere with your rear brake.

, Because people with bad brakes have accidents.How? Before you start rolling, squeeze each brake a couple times to make sure they're working. Squeeze them again lightly as you start rolling to feel for uneven braking due to wheel damage, or the change in braking vibration that can mean your brakes are rubbing the tire rather than the metallic braking surface of the rim.Mechanic's Tip: This is especially important if you frequently take the wheels off for transportation or storage. It's common to forget to hook up the brakes again.What if there's a problem? It may be as simple as taking up a little slack in the brake cable with a barrel adjuster or as complicated as a loose or broken part.Safety Pointer: These are your brakes we're talking about, so if you don't know what you're doing, take it to a bike mechanic.

, If you find something that interferes with disengaging your pedals, you might just save yourself from toppling over sideways at the next stop sign. It's hard to look cool when you're on the ground with your feet stuck in your pedals.How? As you engage the cleat and pedal, take a minute to clip out and back in again once or twice.What if there's a problem? If it feels rough or stuck, it might be a pebble stuck in your cleat. That's easy to fix. But if it feels sloppy and loose, or feels uneven but doesn't improve with a little light oil on the retention mechanism, you might have a broken cleat or pedal. That's more likely to require a trip to the bike shop.Mechanic's Tip: If you're riding in muddy, sandy, rocky or snowy conditions, a couple moderate sideways whacks of shoe against pedal can help you clear the interfering grit and gunk without dismounting.Safety Pointer: More than one rider has been injured by falling over in clipless pedals they couldn't get out of. Don't monkey with the cleat tension unless you understand what you're doing, and give yourself a chance to get used to any changes in a safe test-ride environment.

, Some loose parts will cause things to wear out faster, while others can cause crashes. Either reason is good enough for to check for loose parts.<How? As you mount and push off, feel for anything unusual. The force of your weight on the bike and the first couple pedal strokes will usually make serious problems like loose wheels, saddles, handlebars or accessories apparent with a clunking sensation.What if there's a problem? Depends on what it is. If you can find it and fix it, great; if not, you shouldn't ride until you know what's causing any big clunk.Mechanic's Tip: Again, people who frequently remove wheels for transportation or storage are most likely to encounter forgotten quick release levers.Safety Pointer: Novice cyclists are often mystified by quick-release levers (if you're not certain that you're doing it right, ask someone who knows). But any significant clunking sensation means something is about to fall off or fall apart, and that's never safe.

, Since bikes are so quiet, you can detect problems early with a good ear. Early detection means less expensive repairs and safer riding.How? As you start out on your ride, listen for unusual sounds of scraping, rattling, rubbing, or creaking.What if there's a problem? Stop and see if you can figure it out. If you can't, it might not always be necessary to scrap the ride. Little noises can be really hard to track down, and if there aren't any other symptoms, it might not require immediate attention.Mechanic's Tip: Pay attention to rhythm. Noises that start & stop with your pedaling are usually symptoms of something in the drive train or parts of the bike that bear your weight. Wheel & brake noises will get faster as the bike accelerates, and continue whether or not you're pedaling.Safety Pointer: Noises relating to wheel rotation are always worth finding before you ride anywhere, since they often indicate unsafe conditions in your brakes, tires or wheels. On the other hand, creaking sounds that seem to occur when you shift your weight around on the bike can be as benign as a stem or seat post that needs lubrication, or as serious as a small crack developing somewhere important. Take it to a mechanic if the creaking gets louder or fails to go away.

Take your child to an open area with a gentle hill.,
Make sure your child is well-protected and their bike is a good height.,
Let your child coast downhill while you hold them.,
Let your child coast using their feet to stop themselves.,
Let your child coast using their brakes.,
Teach turning in a flat area.,
Teach your child how to pedal up a paved incline.,
Gradually reduce your support.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Ride a Bike Without Training Wheels2," Though every child learns differently, for many children, slowly coasting down a long, gentle slope is one of the easiest ways to learn. Rolling forward at a slow, controlled speed allows children to get comfortable with the idea that staying upright on a bike without training wheels is almost as easy as staying upright on one with training wheels.


Grassy spots can be great for this. Grass keeps kids from going too fast on their bikes and cushions any falls they may have, making the experience much less stressful for them. The last thing you want is for your child to take a bad spill and get so afraid of riding without training wheels that they won't try again.

, Don't let your child get on their bike without a helmet. Not only is it dangerous, but also a very bad habit to let your child get into.You might also want to consider letting your child wear extra protective gear like knee and elbow pads — for children who are nervous about the idea of riding, this extra protection can make them feel more confident. Finally, make sure that your child can reach the ground with their feet when sitting on the bike, adjusting the seat as necessary.


Note that some places have laws making it mandatory for all bike riders below a certain age to wear a helmet.In some circumstances breaking these sorts of laws can count as a misdemeanor offense for the parent.

, When the child's ready to ride, let them gently roll down the hill or slope you're practicing at. Hold on to their shoulders or the back of their seat to keep them upright. Repeat this a few times until your child is confident and comfortable moving forward on their bike with your help.


As you walk or jog next to the bike, be careful not to put either of your feet in front of (or between) the wheels.

, Next, let your child coast the same slow, easy route down the hill as before, but this time, don't hold them unless they need it. Instruct the child to use their feet to control themselves or stop themselves as needed. This teaches the child the all-important balance skills needed to stay upright on a bike in a safe, controlled setting.If your child starts to lose control, grab them to keep them upright. Though a few spills may be unavoidable, you'll probably want to avoid them if you can, as they can make your child scared to continue.

, Next, do the exact same thing as before, except, this time, tell the child to use their bike's brakes to control their speed. When they get to the bottom, tell them to stop with their brakes. Repeat as needed until the child is confident slowing themselves and stopping without your help. Teaching the child that they can always stop the bike if they heed to is a very important part of building the child's confidence on the bike.


Most children's bikes have foot brakes — in other words, the child has to pedal backwards to brake. Many bike training resources recommend foot brakes for children learning to ride without training wheels because learning how to use the hands in addition to all of the other skills that riding without training wheels requires can be overwhelming for young children.However, if your child's bike has a hand brake, it's still perfectly possible for them to learn on it — it may just take a little more practice.

, Next, mover to a flatter area. Have the child start pedaling forward, then brake to stop. Repeat this several times until they are comfortable. Then, direct your child to try turning the handlebars just slightly while they ride forward. Walk next to the child as they turn, supporting them as needed. It can take some time for the child to get confident turning, so be patient.


Ideally, the child should learn to lean into the turns ever so slightly. However, this can be difficult to communicate to young children, so you may want to have it be something the child discovers on their own.

, Next, have your child pedal up a gentle slope. Here, a hard surface can be better than grass because grass can make it hard for the child to gain enough speed to make it up the hill. Tell the child to push hard on the pedals and, as always, support them as needed to prevent them from falling.

, As your child practices their skills, slowly start holding onto them less and less until they're comfortable with you simply walking beside them. Then, slowly stay further and further away from the child as they ride until they're comfortable riding without you next to them at all. Slow, steady progress is the key here — you basically want the child to start riding on their own without even knowing they're doing it.


Be prepared to ""go backwards"" for a short while if your child takes a nasty spill. It's better to offer your support after a fall than to make your child go it alone — this can turn them off from of biking on their own, making it harder to teach them essential riding skills in the long term.

, Stay upbeat and positive as you teach your child to ride without training wheels. Praise them for the progress they make. Tell them that they make you proud when they finally get to the point of being able to ride on their own. Don't berate them for making mistakes or push them to do things they're not comfortable doing. You want your child to eventually like riding their bike — if they do, they'll eventually be able to continue teaching themselves without any help from you.


Positive reinforcement, the practice of giving a child rewards for good behavior, is recommended by many serious parenting resources. Positive reinforcement teaches a child what good behavior is while giving them love and attention, which are important for any child."

Try a bike with hand brakes.,
Try using a bike with gears.,
Try standing while you pedal.,
Try biking off-road.,
Try doing a bunny hop.",How to Ride a Bike Without Training Wheels3," Eventually, most kids stop using bikes with foot brakes and start using ones with hand brakes. Hand brakes give the rider a little more control by allowing them to choose which wheel to brake with. To use a hand brake, simply squeeze the metal bar in front of either hand grip. The back wheel brake usually slows the bike down more gradually, while the front brake slows the bike down more quickly — be careful not to use the front brake too hard or you might go over the handle bars!


Though every child learns at their own pace, in general, most kids are capable of learning to use hand brakes after about six years of age., Just like most kids eventually start using hand brakes, sooner or later, most kids eventually learn how to ride a bike with gears. Gears make it easy to go very fast, climb steep hills, and maintain a ""cruising"" speed without pedaling hard. To use gears, simply push the lever or switch near the hand grips in either direction. You should notice it suddenly get easier or harder to pedal — the harder it is to pedal, the faster your pedaling will make you go.


Again, every child learns at their own pace. Most kids from ages 9-12 are capable of using bikes with gears after a little basic training., Standing up while you pedal instead of using the seat lets you push on the pedals extra-hard, which makes this a great way to get up hills or gain speed very quickly. In addition, you have to be able to stand up on your bike to do lots of bike tricks (like the bunny hop below). You may find that it's tricky to balance at first or that your legs get tired quickly when you first try to stand up while pedaling. However, with a little practice, it's not hard to build up the strength and balance you need to master this skill.

, When you're comfortable biking on clear, even surfaces like streets, sidewalks, and fields, try biking on an off-road trail. You'll find that this is a little different than biking on a road — it's usually slower, bumpier, and requires you to watch the path in front of you more. However, off-road biking can be a great way to exercise and see parts of the wilderness you haven't seen before, so give it a shot!

, When you feel confident riding your bike at any speed and in any location, try learning a few easy tricks! For example, you can try doing a bunny hop by working up to a slow speed, standing up, and pulling up on the handle bars as you push off of the ground and throw your weight upwards. In the air, lean forward to level out so that you hit the ground on both wheels. When you get good at this, you should be able to pull off a small ""hop"" which is great for getting you up curbs without stopping.


Don't be discouraged if you fall or ""wipe out"" a few times when you're trying to learn the bunny hop and other tricks. Minor nicks and bruises are part of the process of learning — you can't learn without making a few mistakes!

Keep the bicycle dry.,
Keep the bike clean.,
Lubricate the pedals and chain weekly.,
Make sure tires are properly inflated before riding.",How to Perform Routine Maintenance on a Bicycle," Moisture promotes rust, corrosion, and rot—so store your bike inside or under a cover. If you get the bike wet on a ride, dry it thoroughly before putting it away.;
, Use a damp cloth to wash your bike down after riding it, especially if you've gone on a dusty or muddy road. Deposits from the road speed up deterioration of moving parts, so make sure to clean these well. Don't use soap, as it may leave behind a corrosive residue. If your bike needs extra cleaning, use a specialty bike cleaning fluid. Avoid using pressurized washers such as a car wash and use a garden hose carefully to avoid forcing water into the bearings and gears where it will speed corrosion.

, Moving parts tend to grind on each other if not well oiled, so oil the bike's pedals and chain with a specialty bike lubricant. Avoid getting lubricant on the brake pads or on any part of the pedals where you put your feet.

, Inadequate inflation causes tires to grow old before their time, and it may cause sudden tire damage. Inflate the tires to the recommended tire pressure printed on the side of the tires. This number will typically be given in PSI, or pounds per square inch. Use a pressure gauge to ensure the tire is properly inflated. If you don't have a pressure gauge, add air until the tire feels hard when you press on it.

Organize the gear to be packed.,
Weigh each category of items to get a good idea of which items are heaviest.,
Obtain some sturdy, plastic bags to pack with.,
Start with the bulkiest and heaviest items first.,
Test out your setup.",How to Pack a Bicycle Pannier,"  You'll need a large, open space such as a big table or large floor area.  Place similar items together. Make piles for food, for clothing, for bike repair gear, for camping gear, for cooking, etc.;
,  The heaviest items will need to be packed closest to the tires and furthest forward on the bike to improve the stability of bike handling.

,  The gallon-sized ""freezer bag"" zip type bags are excellent for this. Use the zip-style bags to organize and pack the smaller, or water sensitive items.  This prevents them getting lost in the bottom of the pack, and keeps the contents dry.


Clothing can be rolled into small rolls before being put into the bags.  This keeps the clothing dry, and keeps smell transfer to a minimum.

,  The heavier items (frying pan, tent, bike tools, etc) need to act as the back bone for each bag.  Place them low, forward, and nearest a tire.  

Take care to balance each side of the bike by making sure that the front panniers are approximately the same weight as each other, and the rear panniers are the same weight as each other.  Save the lighter, bulkier items (sleeping bag, clothing, etc) for the rear panniers and the rear rack.

, Once you've got the basics packed, do a ""shake down"" ride of 15 miles or so to get used to how the bike handles under a load.  This will help you adjust the pannier weight distribution as needed and will help you fine tune your packing strategies.

Measure the bike.,
Measure your inside leg length, otherwise known as your inseam, from your crotch to the ground.,
Measure against yourself:


Stand beside the bike.,
Look online for a “bicycle sizing chart”.,
Check the frame.,
Take a ride.,
Check that you can adjust the seat.,
Check that your saddle is clear of the top tube.",How to Pick the Right Size of Bike," The two most important measurements on any bike for comfort is the size of the frame and the distance between the seat and the pedal when it is at the bottom of its rotation.;
, Stand with your feet flat.

If it measures between 68 – 76 centimeter (29.9 in), choose a 16” – 17” frame size.
If your inner leg measurement is between 76 - 84 cm, choose a 18” – 20” frame size for men’s bikes, and a 16” – 17” frame size for women’s bikes.
If your inner leg measurement is longer, choose a 20”+ frame for men's mountain bikes, or a 21”+ frame for men's town, trail and road bikes.
For women with a leg measurement of more than 84 centimeter (33.1 in), choose a 16”+ frame for mountain bikes, or a 18”+ frame for town, trail and road bikes.

, If the seat is just below your hipbone, you have a good starting point.






Stand over the bike with your feet on either side and with the seat touching your back. In this position you should have 1.5–2.0” of space between your crotch and the top bar for a road bike, 2.0-4.0” for a mountain bike. Measure this dimension by holding the bike so that that bar comfortably contacts your crotch and someone measures the distance between the bottom of the tire and the ground. Alternatively, two to three fingers between your crotch and the top tube are a good estimate for a road bike. On a mountain bike, four fingers or your entire hand will provide enough room. Finally, with someone holding the handlebars securely, sit on the comfortably bike with one pedal at the bottom of its rotation. If your knee is slightly bent, the bike is adjusted properly. Too little or too much bend will stress parts of your leg and lead to discomfort.







, It will provide multiple techniques to estimate your proper frame size. These recommendations are often ranges of frame size that must be finalized by your personal experience and preference.

, Frame size is typically measured from the middle of the front sprocket to the top of the tube that holds the seat (C/T). It may also be measured from the middle of the sprocket to the center of the top tube (C/C). This dimension is often printed on a label at the top or bottom of the seat tube, sometimes with a picture. A bike shop person will know which method the manufacturer of each bike uses. The frame may be dimensioned in centimeters, inches or designated small, medium, large. To calculate a good estimate of the frame size for you, measure the distance from your crotch to the floor and multiply by .66.


For any frame that does not have a straight top tube, omit that measurement and go with the other two. Children’s bikes are sized differently, based on the child’s height, and expressed as wheel size. An Internet search on this topic will give you proper guidance.







, The most important measuring technique is the test ride. Everyone is a little different, and personal preference has a huge impact on our perception of bike fit. Make your test ride long enough to get a real feel for the bike over smooth and rough terrain. Vary your speed from very slow to comfortably fast. Make some quick changes in speed and direction. The right bike for you will feel comfortable during all these maneuvers and provide pleasurable riding.


If you feel it is hard to get off and on of then maybe it isn't for you. Finding a comfortable bike is key if you're going to be using it a lot (or using it at all).

, It should be adjusted in such a way that your leg is straight or nearly straight when pedaling.

You should be able to reach the ground on both sides at once, by pointing your toes.
Your knees and feet should not hit the handlebars or front wheel.
You should not rest heavily against the top tube when you straddle the bike.
It may depend on the type of handlebars you have, but you may be best off if, when you are in a riding position, you cannot see the front axle through the handlebars or handlebar bracket. That is, there should be a straight line between the front axle, the handlebars, and your eyes.

, On road bikes you should be 1"" clear. On mountain bikes you should be 3"" clear. Is the bike too high for you? This is measurable (roughly) if you stand directly next to it. If the saddle reaches your hip it should be alright."

",How to Use a Pool Noodle to Protect Your Car Against Scratches in the Garage," You will end up with 2 long, hollow pieces. Take safety precautions when cutting the noodle in half, keeping fingers away from the blade.


Lay noodle on a hard surface to cut in half. Identify the middle of the rounded piece first before cutting.;
, Certainly the entire wall isn’t a usual offender, but perhaps there is one area that seems to get dinged the most (typically the area where car doors are opened and closed).


Use your tape measure to determine the specific height of your car door. Keep in mind that SUV doors are considerably higher than doors on a sedan.

, Using your measuring tape and pencil, draw a straight line that denotes where the pool noodle should be located.


Ask an assistant to hold the noodle in place and test out the position before making it permanent. Open and close door in the area to ensure you are on target.

, Apply ample glue to the back of the pool noodle and then hold it firmly in place on the target wall.


Hold for up to 10 minutes or until you know that the glue has adhered to the noodle and wall. Because of the foamy texture you may want to tape it in place too for extra security.

Adjust the front light up or down to suit your preference.",How to Mount a LED Headlamp (Miner's Lamp) Light and Rear Blinker on a Bicycle Helmet," If you're into bicycling, you should already have one. If you have more than one, use the old one, at least first, in case you ruin it. A helmet with a flattish rear end, not a pointed one, will be easiest to use.;
, (A lamp that straps onto the user's head, associated with mining.) It must have a hinged front light mount to direct the beam up and down, with a wide adjustment range.


Preferably the front light will pivot within a low-profile enclosure rather than swinging on an arm, and the kit will have a rear-mounted battery pack with a bright red rear flasher, a high-power white front light, a stretchy coiled wire connecting the parts, and take relatively high capacity AA batteries. LEDs are a virtual necessity for a long, bright life. An old one with a dirty or bad strap would be perfect, since you won't use that part anyway.

, Heavy-duty automotive trim style double-sided tape or epoxy putty are convenient and fill gaps; liquid epoxy is stronger. Get a thick, fast curing variety to not run off of curved surfaces.


Other adhesives may work, but finding one that will bond to but not attack helmet materials such as a mix of plastic and foam can be tricky. Clean all mating surfaces and allow them to dry for a good bond.

, Take the light and any other electrical parts, such as a rear light, battery holder, and associated wires, off of the strap. The strap will not be needed for this project.

, The main light must be mounted where it does not tilt to one side or the other - many have a narrow beam, so accuracy is critical, must have have an unobstructed path forward, must be able to pivot to shine straight ahead (preferably with some extra downward adjustment available) rather than tilted uselessly up, and must not be at the lower edge of the helmet but instead higher up where it will not knock into your face in an accident.


Placement of the battery pack is flexible if it does not have a rear light, but the rear light, whether or not integrated into the battery holder, must shine straight back. The battery door must be openable when the holder is fixed in position. When test-positioning components and checking illumination angles, tilt the helmet to face straight forward as it would be in use, rather than tilting down as it would sit on a table.
If the headlamp has separate front and rear components connected by a cable, the position of the front light forward to back along the crown may be chosen to take up excess slack in the cable. (The cable should not be kept in tension to avoid stress to it, to avoid stress to the components, to avoid stress to flexible adhesive such as tape that it may pull loose and crooked, and because tolerances help ensure successful construction.)

, Noting the constraint of placement of the rear battery pack or light, if any, affix the front light to the helmet as you had determined to be appropriate. It must face straight ahead, so check its path in a dimly lit room and tweak its direction as the adhesive hardens (or before you firmly stick down double-sided tape). Allow adhesive to cure fully before proceeding so it stays aligned.

, If the helmet does not have a suitable mounting surface, a gentle curve can be built up with double sided tape, epoxy putty, or epoxy.


If it has aerodynamic-looking tail ends of spikes at the back protruding well beyond its overall thickness, you might carefully trim these in a relatively sheltered area (not the rear extremity of the overall helmet) to create a small flat mounting area while not harming the overall structure.
Epoxy is very strong and headlamp components are very light: a large mounting area is not needed.

, Choose power and blink settings. Blinking lights front and back are great for being seen even when you have enough light to see.

,, Enjoy your ride!

Create a checklist.,
Search for car transport companies.,
Contact a few car shipping companies.,
Choose a company and verify its legitimacy.,
Prepare your car for shipping.",How to Ship a Car Across the Country," There are a few major things to do before handing over the keys of your car to a vehicle transport company. Thus, it is good to create a checklist first and then move down every step, especially when you are moving your car across the country.;
, Since you will be moving your car across the country you will need a shipping company that can deliver nationwide. It is a good idea to choose a company that is both a carrier and a broker. As a carrier the company has trucks traveling certain roads all the time which often means a quicker delivery of your vehicle across the country. If they don't serve the route you need, then they will find a carrier from their network to pick up your vehicle.

, Research and contact a few companies. Ask them questions regarding their services and rates. Obtain quotes from all of them. Compare the services they offer and the prices they are asking you to pay. If there is a big difference in some rates, consider this a red flag. Car shipping rates are affected by many variables and they can fluctuate often, yet they should be close when it is for the same vehicle and route. Rates vary based on gas prices, miles, make and model of the vehicle, modifications to the vehicle and seasonal changes.

, Make sure you are safe when you are transporting your car across the country. Verify the company's licenses, ratings and insurance policy. Check their USDOT number and BBB rating. It is a good practice to also read reviews of what other customers are saying about the company policies and practices. This is the best way to make sure the company you have chosen is going to deliver what they have promised, and most importantly your car in the same condition it was picked up.

, It is important to have your car's interior and exterior cleaned before pick up to make the inspection easier. The truckers always inspect a car before loading it onto the trailer and mark down any scratches and damages your car has. You should also go over the inspection with the trucker. This way you will be sure that everything is marked correctly when you sign the Bill of Lading and the inspection report. Preparing your car for shipping across the country also means removing any loose parts such as ski and bike racks, rear spoilers, spare tire and all other covers and modifications you can remove.

Take your car for a drive.",How to Remove Your Car From Long Term Storage," Lower your car if you put it up on blocks when you put it into long-term storage. Then remove the vehicle cover and open the windows. This helps get rid of any musty smell. You can also remove any mothballs you placed in your vehicle.;
, Electronics can quickly drain battery power, so have a plan in place in case your battery is dead. If you put your car on a trickle charger when you put it into long-term storage, remove that. Do what you need to so that your battery is fully charged, even if that means getting a new one.

, Many of the things you did to prepare your car for long-term storage helped, but they may not have prevented leaks or other damage. Before you start it back up, it is important that you look over your car to see if there is anything wrong.

Check the engine. Make sure belts and hoses are not damaged. Change any dirty filters. Look for nests that birds or mice may have built during your car's time in storage.






Look at your fluid levels of oil, water, brake fluid, windshield washer fluid, coolant, and power-steering fluid. Change or add more if needed. If one is particularly low, look for puddles underneath your car to see if it leaks.






Check the pressure of your tires. Adjust as needed to get them back to normal.






Put windshield wipers back on your car.







, Let your car run for 20 minutes in order to warm up. Look for any warning lights on your dashboard. Also, check the brake pedal to make sure it feels normal. The brakes could respond noisily after storage if rust accumulated on your car's brake rotors. This brake noise is normal and should go away quickly.

, Though your car was no doubt clean when you put it into storage, chances are it gained some dirt during the storage period. When you remove your car from long-term storage, give it a thorough washing. Take special care to wash the underside of your car, as dirt can build up there as well.

, Driving it around for an hour or so will help you ensure all systems are working properly. It also lets your car get back up to normal temperature after sitting in storage for an extended period. Be sure to take the first few miles slowly. It is normal for your car to make some unusual sounds until it gets properly warmed up.

Lubricate all its rubber parts and clean its upholstery. Vacuuming up any food crumbs will discourage animals (other than yourself) from getting some action in your back seat over the Winter.;
, Ideally, you should drain your car's fluids while it's still warm. When it is heated and circulating, oil picks up and emulsifies contaminants. That's why you must always wear a glove to protect yourself from hot engine oil burns. Note: Make sure the oil contains corrosion protection.

, This only applies if your car has lube fittings. Put clean grease on all of the steering and suspension fittings and pack the front wheel bearings.

, The best way to insure your baby against brake deterioration is to drain your system of old fluids and refill with new ones. (You can apply this one to your partner too...*wink*)

, Once you've done that, start your car to run the rest of the gas out of the lines. Any old gas left behind can clog carburetors and valves. If you are only going to be storing your car for a few months, you can simply add a can of gasoline stabilizer instead.

, This is so air can continue to circulate. Then, refill it with a rust-inhibiting antifreeze. Don't forget to disconnect the heater hoses and drain the heater too. After this, all the car's fluids should be completely drained. BE A FRIEND TO THE ENVIRONMENT: You MUST contact your local household and hazardous waste service for proper disposal!

, Wash it down with water and baking soda, then rinse it off with distilled water. Store it off the ground, and in a dry place...but not on concrete. You can also hook it up to a battery charger/maintainer to keep the battery alive.

, Remove the tires and stack them, placing cardboard between each one as you do so. Finally, cover tires to protect them from harm.

,), Depress the clutch and lock it in position. To do this, press a 2 x 4 against the clutch and the front of the seat. This will prevent your clutch plates from sticking together in storage.

,, Convertible tops can shrink if they are left in the down position for an extended period of time.

, When choosing a car cover, it's very important to select the right kind of fabric. Cotton flannel fabrics breathe well, allowing air to circulate through them as well as being ""cottony soft"" and gentle on your paint job. On the other hand, cotton/polyester fabric blends trap heat and moisture. Plastic films don't breathe at ALL and, therefore, should be avoided. They are a breeding ground...for rust...not like your car’s back seat, which might be a “Breeding Ground” of another kind.

Ship during the offseason.",How to Transport Your Car," Businesses that specialize in transporting automobiles over long distances are sometimes called “auto movers.” Check your local listings to find one that operates in your area. By taking advantage of one of these services, you can make sure your car ends up getting where it needs to go without a lot of frustrating coordination or expense.Shipping is often the best option for people who are forced to move hundreds of miles overnight, or who would rather avoid an unnecessary road trip.
Before deciding to do business with a particular auto mover, do a little research to see what level of protection they can guarantee.;
, When you begin filling out the shipping forms, you’ll be asked to provide details like the make and model, year, mileage and running condition. Based on this information, the auto movers will be able to calculate expenses and recommend the best way for your car to be shipped.A compact 4-door sedan in good working order, for example, will be cheaper to transport than a broken down SUV that won’t start.
Make sure to record your vehicle’s info as accurately as possible to avoid any disputes or additional fees later on.

, In some cases, you’ll be given a choice of how you’d like your vehicle to be shipped. This may range from a single tow rig to a fully enclosed container. Think carefully about which option best suits your budget and needs before coming to a decision.If you’re moving a priceless collection of European sports cars, it will probably benefit you to shell out for a pricier yet more secure shipping option.
Settle on a shipping date that gives you the most leeway with your schedule.

, You’ll typically be asked to pay a certain amount up front, then hand over the rest upon delivery. In addition to the baseline expense of transporting an automobile in your make and model, the distance you’re traveling will be the primary factor in determining how much you owe. Other associated charges may apply, depending on the company you end up going with.Altogether, the cost of having your car shipped will likely be somewhere between $500-1,000.Inquire about financing options if you’re unable to afford the entire amount at once.

, A good insurance policy will safeguard your car from any damage incurred during shipping. Although it is extra, the cost of repairs will almost certainly be much higher should something happen to your vehicle. Insurance should therefore be considered a non-negotiable part of the total expense of transporting your vehicle.Look over your current auto insurance policy to see if it covers long-distance shipping.If you choose not to buy insurance, you’ll be completely responsible for damage and defects.

, Assuming you have the option, a fully enclosed transport is a smart way to go if you’re serious about protecting your vehicle. Cars that remain covered throughout the trip are less likely to receive dings and scratches. That means you won’t have to worry about your paint job being ruined between Point A and Point B.Be sure to specify your preferred shipping method when filling out your vehicle registration forms.On an open carrier, your car will be exposed to the elements, as well as other potential hazards like flying debris.

, Before you part ways with your car, go over it from front-to-back and top-to-bottom and make a note of its general appearance. Do the same as soon as you get it back. If it’s not returned to you in the same condition, the shipping company will be the ones stuck footing the repair bill.Don’t forget to list defects like dents, chips and scratches on the paperwork for your vehicle.

, Clear your car of any tools, equipment, clothing, trash and other items before dropping it off with the movers. Not only will this ensure that nothing gets stolen or misplaced, it may also help bring your transportation fees down a little. In fact, some auto movers make this step mandatory in order to reduce the risk of liability.The vehicle’s overall weight is a major factor in the cost of shipping, so the more you can clear out of it, the less you’ll have to pay.Think twice before loading your car full of boxes and other moving materials., Don’t move forward with a shipping contract until you’ve received an accurate estimate. A certain company may seem like a good choice at first, but you may ultimately discover that it’s out of your price range. Taking the time to a evaluate a quote (or a couple) can give you an idea of how much you can expect to pay on average.Request a quote on the moving company’s website, or see side-by-side results by comparison shopping on sites like uShip or Auto Transport Direct.It’s best to compare companies based on things like their range, insurance coverage and customer satisfaction rather than their rates alone. Remember, you’re paying for peace of mind, as well., Terminal-to-terminal shipping allows you to drop off and pick up your car at different designated sites for a reduced rate. This can be a good way to cut down on out-of-pocket costs if you’ve already been forced to fork over a lot of money on a big move.Terminal-to-terminal shipping will put your vehicle back into your hands sooner.
Make sure you have a way to get to the specified pickup site once you’ve arrived at your destination., As an alternative to shipping, you might also consider paying an independent driver to transport your vehicle personally. Since they’ll be driving your car themselves, you’ll eliminate the added expense of loading the vehicle onto a separate carrier. This is also a helpful option for people looking to transport pets or other valuables that would be difficult to bring on an airplane.Some auto mover services also have drivers available for rent.Hiring a driver might not always be a more economical solution—you might be expected to pay for things like food, lodging and fuel, as well as airfare to send them back once the job is complete., If possible, schedule your move for the beginning or end of the year. Auto movers frequently charge less to transport cars during the winter months, when business tends to drop off. When it comes to getting the best deal possible, every consideration helps.Summer is the busiest time of year for most auto transport services.

,How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot1,
"
Print and laminate your own custom luggage tags.,
Create larger and brighter than normal luggage tags.",How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot2," You can buy inexpensive ID making kits online that allow you to print your own ID sized cards and laminate them.


Once you design and print them on the computer, use a pouch laminator to laminate the luggage tag card and use a hole-puncher to punch a clean hole through the card.
Attach the luggage ID card to your luggage using ribbon or string.
Using this method can give your luggage a professional and clean look, or allow you to customize it with digital pictures.
An inexpensive ID printing and lamination kit works well.

, Create these with colored paper, pictures you find online, and other craft supplies. Have them laminated at your local office supply store or print shop.


This is a great project for kids. Encourage them to color with bright markers on one side of the tags.
Print your name and mobile phone number on the opposite side of the tag.
Have several laminated on one sheet and cut them apart with scissors. Leave about 1/2"" of laminate around the tag.
Punch a hole at the top of the tag, through the laminate and use a zip tie or a shoestring to attach to your luggage.

Tie a brightly colored, thick ribbon to your suitcase.,
Use an old scarf or look in thrift stores or discount bins for bright scarves.,
Use multiple ribbons.,
Buy a package of brightly colored bandanas.,
Recycle an old t-shirt.",How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot3," This is common, though, so make sure your ribbon stands out in a crowd! Alternatively, you can use a piece of fabric. Make sure the ribbon or fabric is fastened securely on the handle so it does not fall off. Avoid making it so long that it can catch on something (like a conveyor belt).


Check fabric stores and look in the discount bins for deep discount remnants of fabric or ribbon. Look for bright colors, metallic fabrics, or ribbon.

, Try to find something cheap or use something that you will not mind being lost or damaged in transit. Scarves with picks or stains are usually deep discounted since they are difficult to clean.

, Look for extra fabric ribbons or recycle ribbons from gift packages. If you find brightly colored ribbons, you can braid several together of various colors to give you a thick ribbon that is easier to see. Do not be afraid to add long strips of various other fabrics cut into ribbon-like strips. Remember to use longer pieces since the braiding will shorten it

, Look in sale racks around holidays for less common (than red or blue) colors. Easter may offer more pastel alternatives.

, Do not throw away a brightly colored shirt because of a stain or tear. Cut the bottom into large 4""-6"" strips and use these to tie to your luggage handle. You can also dye strips from white t-shirts to a bright pink or purple color. Use your tie-dye skills to create a one of a kind marker for your bag. This is a great way to get some use out of shirts that are too small or those free shirts that are given away as marketing tools. Often those free shirts are of low quality fabric or odd colors; this is a great way to make use of them.

Tie a neon paracord to the handle.,
Use colorful zip ties.

,
Use a luggage belt.",How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot4," Use a cobra stitch or Turk's head knot.,, Look for one with a rainbow of colors, interesting patterns or somehow customizable. It'll keep your gear intact and make the bag easier to spot.


Add your own unique collection of embroidered ""sleeves"" by sliding them onto the belt. You can collect sleeves representing countries, states, sports, inspirational, etc. These can be a way to express yourself, as well as being a unique identifier. Indeed, they can be a great conversation starter. Luggage sleeves will work well on a backpack, golf bag, board bag or other 2 inch (5.1 cm) strapping.

Put duct tape on your bag.,
Affix iron-on patches to the luggage.,
Stick many colorful stickers on your luggage.",How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot5," Colored duct tape works best. You could also write a name or some other identifier using duct tape.

, This method works best if you decorate several sides so you can recognize your bag from any angle. Luggage can be recognizable easier if you have unique or colorful patches.

, You can mix and match large and small ones, as required.

Spray paint your luggage.,
Attach a large image of your pet to the luggage.,
Glue on lots of sequins or small decorative craft items.",How to Make Luggage Easier to Spot6," Choose an interesting design, turn it into a stencil and spray paint it in place.

, This could be by way of a luggage tag, an image affixed to the bag or spray painted in place.

, While many are bound to fall off with travel, a lot will stay in place, and these are cheap and easily replaced.

Get settled in.",How to Board a Plane," Although many airlines allow you to check in and print your boarding pass online (if you’re not checking luggage), you can also choose to do so in person at the airport. Enter the airport in the section of your airline carrier, and locate their counter. When you get to the front desk, simply tell them your name and give them ID, and they should automatically print your boarding pass and ask about checked luggage.


If you have multiple flights due to layovers, ask the attendant to print your boarding passes for all flights. Some do this automatically, but it is good to ask if they don’t.
Checked luggage must typically weigh less than 50lbs and costs about $25 to start. This varies from airline to airline though, so check your specific airline's requirements online.
If you don’t want to worry about checking bags, you are allowed one carry on item and one personal item. one that goes under the seat in front of you, and one stored in the overhead bins above your seat. Ask the gate attendant if your bags are small enough to bring with you as carry-ons.
If you print your boarding pass online and are not checking luggage, you can bypass stopping by the airlines counter.;
, If you have your boarding pass in hand and your carry-on luggage prepared, you can head to security. Have both your boarding pass out and a form of ID - either your driver’s license or your passport (it must be your passport if you’re heading out of the country) - readily available. A TSA agent will check your boarding pass to your ID, and then you will must pass through the security check. All of your belongings will need to be placed in bins and sent through an x-ray machine while you are being checked over in a separate machine that is able to scan the body or being examined by a wand scanner (for those with known medical devices).


Airports are very picky about security, but they will also be very vocal about it. Check for signs about what to do in order to successfully pass through security, and if you’re still not sure ask someone for help.
Liquids and laptops must be in their own bins separate from other items.
Any items (including gum and unused gum) that are found in your pockets must be placed in the bins to be scanned by the x-ray. Also, all airports will want you to place any metal objects in the bins as well (and that includes metal earrings and jewelry).
Some security checkpoints require you to remove your belt, shoes and jackets; look for signs to see if your airport does as well. Some airports may ask you to remove your socks as well, but this varies.
A TSA agent will guide you through the process if there happens to be an issue with something in your luggage or on yourself.

, Get your bags re-packed and put your shoes back on so that you can go wait for your plane in the correct terminal! Check your boarding pass for your terminal (typically a letter) and your gate (a number). There should be plenty of signs directing you to this area, but if you can’t seem to locate your gate and terminal, simply ask an airport or airline employee for help.


If your boarding pass does not have the terminal number (and very few don't these days), find a monitor with the flight schedules and check that instead.

, It’s always good to arrive at the airport early so that you have time before boarding the plane, just in case you need it. Run to the bathroom, grab something to eat, or use your last few minutes of freedom to connect to the airport Wi-Fi. Boarding the plane typically begins half an hour before takeoff, so you may have plenty of time to kill.


Be careful not to stray too far from your gate so that you don’t miss an important announcement about your flight or early boarding opportunities.
If you want, you can speak to a flight attendant at the counter of your gate about changing your seats. This is the only opportunity you have to grab a different seat or to upgrade to business or first class., About half an hour prior to takeoff, the gate attendant will announce the boarding time. Boarding is done in sections, either by group/sections (designated with a letter) or by rows/seats. Check your boarding pass to see if you belong to a group, and if not, wait for your row or a section of rows to be called.


First class always boards the plane first, followed by business class and people with disabilities or infants.
Although it is not always the case, it may be beneficial to try to snag a place in line early on so that there is still room in the overhead bins for your luggage. Otherwise, if storage space runs out your bags will have to be checked.

, After waiting in line for boarding, there will be a gate attendant next to the entrance waiting to check your boarding pass. If you are flying nationally, hand your boarding pass to the gate attendant who will scan your boarding pass in (by placing it down on the terminal), but you will not need your ID out at this point. If you are flying internationally, you will need to show your passport again at this point. Keep your boarding pass out after having it checked, as you may need to show it to an additional flight attendant on the plane.

, While most hallways are short, there are some gates who may have line hallways much longer and curvier than others.

, There is typically a buildup of passengers after the boarding pass check, so you may have to wait in line again before boarding the plane. Check your seat to make sure you are headed in the right direction, and keep a lookout for your row number. If you need help finding your seat, ask others around which seats are for which row and later which seat letter is for which seat (there is no ""one size fits all"" for explanations here). Most flight attendants are busy getting their supplies ready for your flight. If you still require more help finding your seat, step into an open seat near the row and once the flight attendant comes around to check on your seat belt, you can ask them then.)

, When you have located your seat, place your smaller bag under your chair, and look for available space in the overhead bins for your larger carry-on. This isn’t always the easiest task, so turn to a flight attendant for assistance in searching or placing your bag if necessary. When you’re finally able to get in your seat, place your smaller carry-on under the seat in front of you.

, You’re all done! Now it’s time for you to sit back and relax while you are carried away to your destination in luxury. During the flight, you will sometimes be offered a free drink and food (depending on the carrier and length of the flight). If needed, there are restrooms in the front and back of the plane. Any other questions can be directed towards flight attendants."

If you're using the machine, then you'll need to type in the station code for Newark Airport. Indicate whether you're buying a round-trip or one-way ticket, and whether you're a child or an adult.


One way to find the NJ Transit area is to take the escalator down from the MSG side of the station, then veer left.

, Look out on the screens by the NJ Transit to await the arrival of your NJ Transit train. Normally the trains arrive at the station approximately 20 minutes before they depart. The trains on each train line run about twice an hour, except in the late hours (after 10 pm or so). If you're taking the Northeast Corridor line to the airport, then look out for the ""NEC"" sign on the screen when you search for your train.


Double-check that the train stops at Newark Airport. As you board the train, there will be a screen on the wall before you head down the stairs: it lists all of the stops that the train will take.
The train will usually stop at Secaucus and then Newark Penn Station before your stop.Do not make the mistake of getting off at Newark Penn Station instead of Newark Liberty Airport.

, Once you make it to the Newark Airport stop, you'll need to take the Airtrain to complete your journey. This elevated monorail ride is your transport between the Newark Airport train stop and the airport.


Don't bother calling a cab. You'll need to wait around for more than a few minutes. Furthermore, the mess of one-way streets can be confusing to navigate to the airport via the train station.

, Check your plane ticket or reservation for your airline and terminal number. The Airtrain cars and station will have a map of the terminals, so make sure you get off at the right spot. You'll need to walk a bit further to get to the terminal and to begin checking in for your flight.

Try the #62 bus.,
Take NJ Transit from New York Penn Station to Newark Penn Station.,
Catch the #62 bus.",How to Get to Newark Airport from Manhattan3," This is arguably the cheapest way to get from Manhattan to Newark Airport. You'll need to take a train from New York Penn Station to Newark Penn Station, then catch the bus to the airport. The total cost should be about $5 for adults., The ride takes about 15 minutes and costs $3.75.

, It should stop along the Penn Station Bus Lanes. Get the bus headed toward Newark Airport Terminals. Buses run every 20 minutes or so, and they take about 25 minutes to arrive at the airport. The fare is $1.25.

Consider driving, if you have a car.,
Enter New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel.,
Get onto I-78 West.,
Take Exit 57 for Newark Liberty International Airport / Terminals A B C. Follow the signs to get to the airport.",How to Get to Newark Airport from Manhattan4," This is the costliest option, and it may take much more time than the other methods – especially if traffic is bad. The upside is that you won't need to take any public transportation, and you won't need to navigate the complexities of a multi-leg journey.Call a cab or an Uber, but only if you must. In most cases, this will be much more expensive than public transportation.

, If you have a car, you can drive through the Lincoln Tunnel, then get on I-95 South toward Newark. You will need to stop for a toll booth several miles after entering New Jersey.

, Take the right ramp from I-95 onto I-78W toward Clinton/Newark Airport. You'll need to stop for another toll booth.

Be aware that some taxis will not take you across state lines.

Decide on your travel class.,
Pick a preferred seating location.,
Make a list of your seating needs.,
Use an online seating guide to research your options.",How to Get a Good Seat on an Airplane1," If you’re willing to shell out the extra money for a ticket in first class or business class, you’re likely to get more comfortable seats than you would in economy class. Before booking a flight, take a look at your budget and decide what travel class will work best for you.


Even if you can’t or don’t want to pay for a first class or business class ticket, you might be able to get a last-minute upgrade for little or no extra cost.;
, There are different advantages and disadvantages to sitting in different areas of the plane. When thinking about where you would like to sit, consider some of the following:A seat closer to the front of the plane offers a quicker exit at the end of the flight.
A seat over the wing provides maximum stability if you happen to hit turbulence.
If you’re concerned about safety, sit in an exit row or toward the rear of the plane. Both of these locations may be associated with higher survival rates in the event of a crash.
A seat near the lavatories may be ideal if you need a lot of bathroom breaks, but these areas also tend to come with higher passenger traffic and the possibility of bad smells.

, In addition to picking a preferred spot on the plane, think about other features you would like your seat to have. Here are a few things to consider:Legroom: If you’re sitting in economy class, aim for a bulkhead seat, aisle seat, or emergency exit row seat. Seats with higher “pitch” (the space between your seat and the seat in front of it) also offer more legroom.
Recline: A reclining seat can make a big difference to your comfort if you’re hoping to sleep during the flight. Some seats, like those in front exit rows on certain planes, can’t recline.Width: If you need more room to spread out, you might want to choose a flight that offers wider seats. You can find out both the width and pitch of seats available on most flights at SeatGuru.com.
Aisle vs. window seats: If you think you’ll need to get out of your seat a lot, or need some extra legroom, an aisle seat is your best bet. If you like looking out the window or want to be able to lean up against the wall to sleep, choose a window seat.

, Once you have an idea of what you’re looking for, go to a website like SeatGuru.com or SeatExpert.com. You can browse these websites by airline, or even enter a specific flight number, to find information about available seats, including:


Seat pitch
Seat width
Recline
Proximity to various parts of the plane, like the lavatories, exit rows, or wings
Seat-specific amenities, like personal TV screens, power ports, or under-the-seat storage
User comments about issues associated with specific seats

Select your seat when you book your flight.,
Book your flight as far in advance as you can.,
Purchase a premium seat.,
Sign up for your airline’s frequent flier program.",How to Get a Good Seat on an Airplane2," Many airlines will allow you to choose your seat when you buy your ticket. Depending on the airline, there may or may not be an extra fee associated with choosing your own seating assignment.If you can’t select your seat online, try calling the airline and speaking to an agent. They might be able to assign a preferred seat for you.
Use a site like SeatGuru.com to help you decide which seat to pick when you are booking the flight. That way, you will have seating information specific to the aircraft model on which you’ll be flying.

, If your airline allows passengers to select their seats at booking time, the best seats may be grabbed up quickly. If you can, book your flight a few weeks in advance, so that you can maximize your chances of getting the seat you want., In some cases, you can pay a little extra to get a better seat. Some airlines offer options like “Economy Plus” or “Even More Space” seats that offer more comfort or legroom without requiring you to shell out for a business or first class ticket., Most airlines offer frequent flier programs, which come with a variety of perks. Loyal members who have earned a lot of points may be offered seating upgrades or first pick of prime seats."

Check in at the airport early.,
Purchase an upgrade when you check in.,
Ask about seating options at the gate.",How to Get a Good Seat on an Airplane3," Even if you weren’t able to choose your seat when you booked your flight, you can often select your seat when you check in for your flight, or when you arrive at your departure gate. Check in and get to your gate with plenty of time to spare to maximize your chances of getting the best possible seat.For a domestic flight, you should get to the airport at least one hour before your flight is scheduled to depart. For international flights, try to get there two hours before departure.
If you arrive at your departure gate too late, there is a risk that your seat will be given to another passenger.
If your plane does not have assigned seating, boarding as early as possible can help ensure that you get the kind of seat that you want.
While it’s generally best to arrive early, arriving a little late or right on time may increase your chances of getting bumped up to a higher class.

, Sometimes better seats or bargain-priced class upgrades become available at the last minute. If you’re flying economy, you might be able to snag an upgrade to business or first class for a relatively small fee.Depending on the airline, you might be able to upgrade at a check-in kiosk, or by speaking with the agent at the check-in counter.
For example, ask the agent, “Are there any deals available on upgrades to first class for this flight?”

, If you weren’t able to get the seat you want ahead of time, the agent at the departure gate might be able to reassign you to a seat that’s better for your needs. New seats sometimes open up at the last minute when another passenger cancels their flight or upgrades to another class.Be as specific as possible. If you’re familiar with the seat plan on your flight, ask if a specific seat is available. You could ask, “Is there any chance I could sit in 12A?”
Otherwise, describe your needs in as much detail as you can. For example, “I’m looking for an aisle seat over the wing.”

Board early.,
Use a space saver bag to reduce the girth of your clothing.,
Mind your manners.",How to Avoid Checking Your Bag on a Plane," There are a few sneaky and somewhat dubious ways around the insanity to find an overhead bin. While these tricks may work sometimes, making it a habit, especially if you fly a certain route on a regular basis could help you earn the award as “annoying passenger.”


Request early boarding or a seat in the first few rows. This is one of the most honest ways to get on the plane the quickest.






Use the kids as leverage. Even if you know your 5 year-old will board like a pro, take advantage of the “traveling with small children” call for early boarding. This is one time where having junior with you will help.
Fake an injury. If you’ve hurt your leg in the past and own one of those walking boots, strap it on and limp your way to early boarding.
Line up early. While you are most likely supposed to line up with your boarding group, you can get in line behind the previous group and act as though you got confused with regard to which group was being called. Fifty-fifty chance you’ll get ushered through to the plane or asked to move aside.;
, You can possibly fit a full suitcase of clothing in a carry-on bag by simply compressing your items into neat, thin piles. Load the space saver with your clothing and use your vacuum to extract air. Fold in half and place in bag.

, If you arrive at the gate with a bag that clearly should have been checked you will be asked to check it. Instead of acting annoyed and angry at the notion, sweet talk the flight attendant into seeing if you can fit your bag underneath the seat or in the overhead bin first. Let the flight attendant know if you can’t find an appropriate/safe spot you’ll bring it back to be checked.


Be courteous to other passengers. Instead of rearranging bags at will, make sure you ask passengers if you could slide their bag down in order to make room for yours.

Adjust your sleep and eating schedule.,
Get enough sleep before you fly.,
Avoid coffee and alcohol 12 hours before your flight.,
Book an overnight flight.",How to Avoid Jet Lag1," Do this a few days to a week before you are set to fly. If you are traveling east, go to bed one hour earlier each night in the two to three days leading up to your departure. If you are traveling west, go to bed one hour later in the two to three days before your flight. This will give your body a chance to gradually adjust to your new time zone when you land in your destination.You should also try to adjust your eating schedule in the two to three days before your flight. Have your meals closer to when you will be eating them at your destination so your body gets used to the new meal times. For example, if dinner time is one hour ahead in your destination, have your dinner one hour later than usual at home.;
, Make sure you get several nights of good, quality sleep leading up to your flight. Being sleep deprived when you board the plane will make your jet lag much worse. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, do calming activities before bed, and make your sleep space cozy and quiet to help you get to sleep.You may also create a sleep routine in the week leading up to your flight to prepare. Doing a calming activity before bed like reading, taking a bath, or chatting with your partner in bed can make it easier for you to fall asleep and maintain a regular sleep routine.

, Drinking coffee and alcohol before you fly can make your jet lag much worse once you land. Try to stay away from coffee and alcohol 12 hours before you are set to fly. Instead, stay hydrated by drinking lots of water leading up to your flight.Pack a water bottle in your carry-on so you can sip water while you are at the airport waiting for your flight. You can also get the water bottle filled on the plane so you can stay hydrated while in the air.

, If possible, try to book an overnight flight. This way, you can have dinner at a normal time in the evening and are more likely to sleep on the flight during the night. Depending on your destination, you may arrive in the morning or afternoon if you opt for an overnight flight. This will make it easier for you to adjust to the new time zone once you land.If you can’t get an overnight flight, try to get a flight where you land in the morning or afternoon rather than the evening. This can make dealing with jet lag much easier in your destination.

"
"
Bring a pillow and an eye mask.,
Take a sleeping pill.,
Change your watch to the timezone of your destination.,
Drink lots of water.,
Do light exercise.",How to Avoid Jet Lag2," To avoid jet lag, it’s important that you get enough sleep on the plane. Pack a travel pillow and an eye mask to make sleeping on the flight easier. Bring a blanket or a big scarf that you can use to stay warm while you sleep.You can also pack headphones or earplugs to block out noise or distractions on the flight.

, Only take sleeping pills during the flight if you have taken them before and at a low dosage. One sleeping pill is often good for an overnight flight to help you sleep. Taking more than one can end up making you feel groggy when you land, and could end up making your jet lag worse.Ask your doctor for advice on dosage and when you should take the sleeping pill during your flight.

, If you wear a watch, change the time so it matches the timezone of your destination. You can also adjust the clock on your cellphone. Doing this will help you get accustomed to the new timezone and prepare you for a new sleeping and eating schedule.If you are not sure what the new timezone will be at your destination, ask a flight attendant for this information.

, It is common to get dehydrated on the plane, and dehydration can make jet lag much worse. Try to drink at least 8 ounces of water for every hour you are in the air. Sip from a water bottle in your carry-on and request water from the flight attendant.Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages on the flight, as they can interfere with your sleep.

, Try to get up and walk in the aisle of the plane, especially during a long flight. Doing light exercise and moving your body can help improve your blood circulation on the flight. It may also help you get to sleep more easily, especially if you go for a short walk around before you go to sleep.You can also try doing light stretching in the aisle, such as standing side stretches.
Deep breathing and meditation may also help you stay calm and relaxed during the flight.

"
"
Go outside once you land.,
Avoid going outside if you've traveled more than eight time zones.,
Eat at the local time.,
Stick to a regular sleep schedule.,
Take melatonin to help you sleep.",How to Avoid Jet Lag3," Once you get to your destination, it is important that you get enough exposure to natural sunlight. Light exposure helps to regulate your body’s circadian rhythm and make it easier for you to adjust to your new location. If you have traveled westward, try to go outside in the early evening so you get exposed to light at night. If you have traveled eastward, go outside in the morning so you get exposed to light early in the day., The one exception to this rule is if you have traveled more than eight time zones from your original time zone. If you have traveled more than eight time zones to the east, wear sunglasses and stay away from bright light in the morning. Then, try to get as much sunlight as possible in the late afternoon.If you’ve traveled more than eight time zones to the west, avoid outdoor light a few hours before dark during the first few days so you can adjust to the local time.

, Once you land, try to have your meals at the local time so your body can adjust. If you land at night, for example, have dinner at the local time. If you land in the morning, have breakfast at the local time.If you find yourself getting hungry between meals, have small snacks to keep your stomach satisfied. Only have large meals at the local time so you adjust better to the new time zone.
Make sure you have a lot of water as part of your meals. Dehydration can make your jet lag worse. Avoid alcohol and caffeine once you land as they can negatively affect your sleep.

, You should also go to sleep based on the local time and stick to a regular sleep schedule. This will make your jet lag less intense and help your body adjust to the new time zone.For example, if you land in the early evening, try to stay awake until the late evening so you can go to sleep at an appropriate time. If you get in early in the day, stay awake until the evening so your sleep time matches the local time.

, If you struggle with going to sleep in the new time zone, consider taking melatonin. Melatonin is a nonprescription drug that has been shown to help set your internal clock and make going to sleep much easier. Having 3 milligrams of melatonin before bed for several days after arrival can help regulate your sleep schedule.Speak to your doctor about taking melatonin before you go on your trip.

Check the status of your flight before going to the airport.,
Monitor the weather.,
Keep all of your travel information easily accessible when you go to the airport.,
Find out how long of a delay is expected.,
Confirm if connecting flights will be missed.,
Ask about baggage.,
Consider any children you are traveling with.,
Make yourself comfortable.,
Call anyone who was planning to pick you up at your arrival airport to inform them of the delay.,
Look for other flight options if your flight is delayed due to mechanical, ongoing natural disaster or airline problems and you really need to get to your destination on time.,
Stay focused.,
Re-book your flight.,
Find out if the airline will provide a hotel room, if you are stranded overnight.

,
Ask for a refund.,
Contact people at the other end to alert them to the change of plans.,
Be prepared for a long wait.,
Stay polite but firm about your situation when released from the airplane.,
Realize that everyone is suffering from the delay or cancellation too; the flight crew and every other passenger.",How to Cope with Flight Delays and Cancellations," You can call the airline or check flight status online. If you notice delays online, contact the airline directly for more information.;
, If weather is bad, flights into or out of the airport will be affected. Icy conditions, stormy weather and extreme weather events are of particular concern.


Besides the weather, other natural problems affect flights. If a volcano has erupted along your destined flight path, the airplane cannot travel through the volcanic ash. This type of delay can last for days or possibly weeks.

, You will need confirmation numbers, flight numbers, and any phone numbers for your travel agent or people who are waiting for your flight arrival. Have these in a handy place that is easy to find. This will reduce worry about losing vital information.

, This will help you re-evaluate your travel plans. Depending on the expected length of delay, you may need to return home or, if you're in transit or in another state or country, you may need to consider making alternative accommodation arrangements.

, If the first leg of your journey is delayed an hour, you might miss a connecting flight you have scheduled.


Talk to an airline representative about getting another connecting flight if you are concerned you will miss your existing connection.

, Airlines have different procedures regarding checked luggage when flights are delayed or cancelled. You should receive instructions from an agent or customer service representative.

, Babies and small children have feeding and sleeping schedules that may be interrupted. Your level of coping will be affected by ensuring their needs are met quickly and with a minimum of fuss.


Keep infant formula and baby food in your carry-on luggage so you can adjust how and when to feed the children in your care.
Feed children while waiting out the delay so that they do not get hungry or cranky.
Find a gift shop that sells snacks, or look for healthy options at restaurants and snack bars near the boarding gate.
Ask for help if you need it; the attendants will realize your need if you voice it and many will do their best to point you in the right direction of food, toilets, and other basic needs.

, There is little you can do when a flight is delayed. See it as an opportunity to catch up on quiet time, reminding yourself that getting panicked or anxious won't improve the situation. Try to take the delay in your stride.


Read a book or a magazine, listen to music or get something to eat while you wait for your delayed flight.

, If friends, family members or business contacts were expecting you at a certain time, let them know your flight has been delayed.


Ask friends and family to watch the flight details online themselves, for any flight you take. This will help them to realize as quickly as you that you're delayed.

, If you are supposed to be at a wedding without fail, see if there are other travel options available.


Ask your airline to re-book you onto another flight or endorse your ticket towards another airline. Airlines are not required to do this, but you can always ask.
Explain why it is important to get there. You will get more sympathy if you can prove that you are going to an event that won't happen again, like a wedding or a funeral.

, Delays are hard to cope with but cancellations can make you sweat, worrying about whether or not you will reach your destination. You will get there if you stay focused and attentive. This means to reschedule, alerting people at the other end of changes in plans and staying alert for updates.

, The airline will try to get you on the next available flight to your destination.


Talk to your travel agent, if you used one to book your flight. Your agent might have access to more information than you do, and can get you re-booked more quickly.
Call your travel insurance company if you purchased insurance when you booked your trip. They can help you re-book over the phone.

,, If you do not want to have your flight re-booked, the airline can refund you the cost of your ticket.

, If you had an urgent meeting to make, consider asking to use a business lounge and attending the meeting virtually by Skype or telephone. Make use of technology––it's better than nothing.

, This is a most harrowing experience an air traveler can experience. The air grows stale, the toilets gets filthier and food runs out. Everyone's patience grows thin. In this case, focus on staying calm and keeping cool and hydrated.


Fill your water bottle at the first sign of a delay. Drink sparingly but regularly.
Distract children with games, reading, electronic devices, etc.
Talk to other passengers about positive things. Acknowledge their stress and feelings and gently remind them that worrying won't improve the situation and never underestimate the power of kindness. You might find distraction in relieving others' worries through finding little ways to alleviate their discomfort, like bringing them water or telling them a story. It helps to pass the time!
Walk around regularly to stretch your legs. Encourage others to do likewise.
Bring lack of hygiene issues to the attention of the attendants, realizing that they are also subject to the limitations of the facilities.
Tell the attendant if anybody appears ill, violent or in distress. It might be useful to find the principal attendant to get things dealt with swiftly.

, Again, realize that you are among many people who also want resolution of their issues. Be concise, polite and offer to be flexible about connections, etc. If you are so tired, angry and fed up that you know you will blow your top, consider returning the following day after sleeping, especially when you are in your hometown or have accommodations already sorted.

, When tempers flare, some people consider their needs to be more important than everyone else's and this can set people off, arguing and complaining. It may be difficult staying calm and polite, but it will win you more responsiveness from those in a position to help you. Air rage is ugly. People are naturally inclined to help those who help them by being friendly, patient and understanding. Use that knowledge for your own benefit.

As you approach the lock:


Skipper - Drop off your shore crew, asking them to close the front doors of the boat.,
The lock crew needs to set the lock.,
The lock crew opens the gates.,
The skipper should enter the lock.,
Close the gate behind the boat, and check the paddles are shut.

,
Open the paddles at the other end of the lock.,
Once the water level has equalized you can open the gates to let the skipper drive out of the lock.,
Drive out of the lock and steer alongside the bank at a place where the lock crew can re-board, or simply wait in the lock exit.

,
Close the gates - except that if a boat is approaching the lock from ahead, you can save them and you time by leaving the gates open for them: if the other boat is lightly-crewed, you might even wait to close the gates after the other boat has entered.",How to Use a Narrowboat Sized Canal Lock," If the gates at your end of the lock are open, go straight into the lock; otherwise, moor up on the lock moorings and wait for the shore crew to open the gates.






Lock Crew - Walk to the lock side - not forgetting an L-shaped windlass (""lock key"") for everyone. Read the lock notices for any special instructions (if a lock keeper is present ask him or her)





;
, If the water in the lock is not (exactly) level with the bit of canal that the boat is in, you will need to equalise the water levels. (If the lock is set for an approaching boat - allow them to use the lock first). Make sure the gates and paddles at the far end of the lock are closed, then open the paddles at the near end (the end nearest your moored boat). You open a paddle by fitting the lock key onto the winding mechanism, and turning it many times.

, While the boat is entering, close the paddles.

, If appropriate, throw a rope to your shore crew. For instance, a narrow boat ascending a wide lock can experience a lot of turbulence and you may wish to ask for your front or centre rope to be tied to a bollard, to give you something to drive against to keep position more easily. Otherwise, the shore crew will be able to control the boat without tying up, by holding the ropes and using bollards to safely reduce the strain and resist snatching - in fact if you are descending you must not let anyone tie up your craft. When descending a narrow lock there will be little turbulence and ropes are rarely needed: the skipper can usually control the boat adequately with the engine on low revs (on the River Thames, engines must be turned off in locks).

,, Open just one paddle very slowly at first AND observe the consequences. Be ready to close paddles quickly if things start to go wrong, do not re-secure any locks on the paddles until the boat is safely ready to leave.


When ascending: Open ground paddles first, do not open gate paddles until the lock is half full and there is no danger of a fountain of water swamping the boat (many lock gates now have baffles over the paddles to prevent this). In a wide lock, first open the ground paddle on the same side as the boat - this will usually establish a water flow that will keep the boat neatly against the lock side s it ascends (but there will be exceptions to this rule depending on the exact configuration of the lock). Be ready to close the paddles quickly if any part of the boat appears to be caught under an obstruction (particularly any foot boards overhanging the lower gate).






When descending: Do not tie the ropes. Be ready to close the paddles again if the boat appears to be ""hung up"" on anything - especially the underwater sill (step) just in front of the top gates.






Skipper - Ascending or Descending: Be ready to shout a warning to the lock crew if anything goes wrong. Keep the boat as still as possible by using a moderate amount of throttle - this will be all that is required unless you let your attention wander and let appreciable forward or backward momentum build up. Constantly check that the boat is not caught on anything by checking that a) Small touches of throttle move the boat backwards and forwards freely b) The boat is completely level c) The boat is rising or falling smoothly (measure progress by looking at the brickwork joints).






Skipper - Ascending: Check constantly that you, the tiller, and the stern rails remain well clear of anything overhanging the bottom gate (particularly the foot boards or bridge) but also that you are not so far forward that any water leaking through or spilling over the top gates (or coming through gate paddles opened too early) is filling the front of the boat. If you have allowed passengers to remain in the front well of the boat, they may discover why a leaking lock gate is called a ""Granny-Soaker"". If you ever do fill the front of the boat, you will always close the front doors henceforth!. If the shore crew have tied the centre or front rope in the right place, a little constant forward throttle will maintain a gentle tension on the rope which will keep the front of the boat from swinging about, leaving you free to use the rudder to keep the back of the boat neatly against the lock side.






Skipper - Descending: There will be little turbulence when descending, though there there may be a significant backward or forward ""draw"". But you will probably require only light throttle touches to keep the boat stationary. BUT be absolutely certain that the rudder and propeller remain well forward of the top gate and thus are clearing the underwater sill (step): observe the white lines painted on the lock side. ""Hanging"" the rear of the boat on the sill as the lock continues to empty will at least damage the rudder and propeller, and is likely to sink the boat. Once caught, the only remedy is to get the lock crew to immediately close the bottom paddles (to stop the lock emptying further), and then (provided the boat is still floating, but not otherwise) to very slowly open the top paddles and refill the lock). If this is not done quickly, then as the front of the boat dips steeper and steeper, the boat will eventually slide off the sill and either drop flat into the water causing a wave that descends to swamp the boat, or simply nosedive under.







, While this is happening, close the paddles to preserve water and provide less work for the next boat crew. (If on your own in narrow boat in a wide lock, tie your boat while you open the gates.)

,, If a boat is coming from behind, you may wish to save them some time by opening a paddle at their end of the lock. Rejoin your boat.

If you are sailing with a crew, ask your crew if they are ready to tack.,
Push the tiller away from you and put one foot across the dinghy.,
Still crouching, step over to the other side of the boat.,When you get to the direction you want, straighten up the tiller, sit down, and when comfortable, swap the main sheet and tiller around in your hands.",How to Tack in a Dinghy," If they are, respond with ""tacking"" when you are ready to tack.;
, Crouch while you are doing this. Face forwards, not back when moving across (this assumes you are in a centre main sheet dinghy as most modern dinghies are - in an aft main sheet dinghy you should face backwards)

, As you turn through the wind, the boom will switch sides, so you need to duck as you step to the other side of the boat.

Pack supplies.,
Take a sailing course.,
Tell someone before going out on the water.,
Choose calm, uncrowded waters.,
Start in a small boat.,
Begin on a boat rigged with one sail.,
Practice capsizing your vessel.,
Become familiar with controlling the sails.",How to Start Sailing," Before you venture out on your first trip, be sure to acquaint yourself with important sailing terms. When sailing with a group as part of the crew, the skipper (person steering the boat) may call out directions using these terms. You will need to know them to be an effective crew member and act quickly, as there are often situations that arise when sailing that will require you to act fast.Aft refers to the back of the ship.
Bow refers to the front of the ship.
Port is the left-hand side of the boat when you are facing the bow (front).
Starboard is the right-hand side of the boat when you are facing the bow.;
, Before you sail, learn what it means to tack and jibe.


Tacking refers to a sailing maneuver in which the sailor(s) turn the bow of the boat through the wind. The wind will change from one side of the vessel to the other side.
Jibing refers to a sailing maneuver in which the boat is turned into the wind so that the wind goes from one side of the boat to the other. Jibing is not as common as tacking since it can be much harder to do correctly., The boom is the horizontal pole which extends from the mast (the tall pole-like object) and is part of the mainsail. Some of the most common sailing injuries are a result of not being aware when the boom is about to swing. This usually happens during a tack or jibe. To avoid a bump to the head, or even worse, being knocked overboard, one of the most important beginner sailing tips to always remember for both passengers and crew is to be conscious and respectful of the boom at all times, especially when the skipper yells out for the crew to execute a tack or jibe.

, When sailing, it can be much cooler on the water than it is on shore, due to the wind exposure. It can be helpful to combat this by dressing in layers. Comfortable casual clothes and non-slip shoes are usually suitable for sailing. If you know are going to get wet, wear a swimsuit underneath your layers and leave the nice clothing at home. Tie back long hair and avoid excessive jewelry, which could pose a safety risk if it got caught in the ropes or elsewhere. Bring a raincoat or jacket to protect yourself from rain or wet weather.It’s best to wear closed-toe shoes for your own safety.
You can buy shirts with sun protection built into them. These are often sold at sportswear stores or can be found online.
If you are crewing a boat or sailing your own small vessel, wear clothes that can get wet, such as spandex or Lycra. These are usually materials used in swimwear. There are also websites that specialize in selling sailing gear, such as SailingWorld.com., When sailing, there is always a possibility that your boat capsizes (overturns into the water) and you become separated from it, carried away in a current, or are too exhausted to swim to shore. Avoid a dangerous situation and wear a proper-fitting lifejacket at all times. These can be purchased at boating stores.

, Whenever you are sailing, you will be handling ropes. Sailing gloves provide protection, grip, and warmth. In order to handle these ropes without getting rope burn or being unable to adequately grasp the ropes, you will need to purchase a pair of sailing gloves. Sailing gloves look like gloves that are used for weightlifting and will usually be fingerless. They can be purchased online at sailing apparel websites or in boat stores such as West Marine.

, It is difficult to shield yourself from the sun on a sailboat, unless you are onboard a large boat with a living area(s) below decks. Pack plenty of sunscreen, wear sunglasses, and be sure to wear a hat. Pack an extra hat or two just in case one of your hats goes flying off your head in the wind., Pack a small drawstring bag or backpack with a few bottles of water, snacks, a towel, and some first aid items. For longer trips, you should also include extra changes of clothes, something nice to wear in the evening if you head to a coastal town for dinner, toiletries, non-slip shoes for walking around the sailboat and a suitable pair of shoes for wearing off the boat, your prescription medication, and a small flashlight., Invest in a good sailing course through a community sailing club or center near you. In-depth, formal, and in-person instruction is the best way to learn how to sail. You can start at any age!


It is usually not possible to begin sailing without a course, as most sailing centers won’t allow you to take out their vessels without either taking a course from them or demonstrating your sailing knowledge.

, One of the most important parts of sailing is to notify the sailing club or another person of your whereabouts. Let them know the area you plan to sail in and when you plan to be back. This will give you and others peace of mind before you head out to the open water.


Even if you are going to meet your sailing instructor, notify a third party of your plans.

, If you’re just starting to learn sailing basics, one of the most important beginner sailing tips to remember is to practice in ideal conditions of light winds and low traffic. This will give you ample space and agreeable weather to practice and gain confidence in your skills.

, It’s easier to learn how to sail with fewer lines and sails. A small dinghy will be more responsive and easier to maneuver, and is also perfect for practicing capsizing (tipping the boat underwater and then correcting it).

, Choose a boat with a single sail or perhaps just the mainsail and a jib (the small sail located in front the main sail). Starting on a boat that’s rigged with only one sail will make learning sailing basics easier and less complicated.

, Capsizing is inevitable in sailing, moreso with small vessels less than 20 feet long than the larger yachts. This may seem odd, but it’s better to practice how to handle a capsized sailboat in a controlled environment, as opposed to an uncontrolled one. New sailors learn best from experience, and the valuable sailing basics you’ll pick up from going through a test-capsize in a small dinghy will serve you well in the event of a real-life one.

, The best sailors are the ones who are able to adjust sail settings to take advantage of different wind and water conditions. In general, sails should be relatively flat when the wind is either very light or very strong, and full when there is a moderate wind.

Buy a road bike with handlebars even to the seat height if you are just beginning.,
Purchase a ""rack"" if you plan on traveling or commuting with your bike.",How to Measure and Buy the Correct Bike1," There are a lot of different types of road bikes available for different styles and functions. They are all, however, made for generally even, hard terrain like city roads or smooth trails. They are the most common bikes out there, and can be broken up into a few subcategories:



Racing/Road bikes: Aerodynamic, fast, and light, these bikes are the most common road warriors. They have thin tires and lighter frames, and usually aren't made to carry extra weight. Components are built for speed on a variety of geography, from big hills to long flats.

Cross bikes: These have wider tires and a sturdier frame, and are built for a variety of terrains, from city roads to bike paths and light trails. They are usually built to handle some weight, so they work well for commutes to work or the store and on short-range trips.

Touring bikes: Made for long, self-contained trips, these bikes are sturdy, no-frills bikes that can take a beating and hold a lot of weight. Because of this, they also function well as commuter or city bikes.

Triathalon/Time-Trial Bikes: Build for speed, these expensive beasts are light as a feather and have special handlebars that let you lean down for minimum wind resistance.;
, The main factor in buying the right bike is the frame size. The frame is the metal body of the bike, and it is measured in three key places. While most bike frames utilize only one measurement for sizing, knowing how to locate all three is key to getting the right size bike.



Seat Tube: This is the vertical bar between your seat and the pedals. It is measured to the center of the crankshaft, which is the circular disk that your pedals attach to.

Top Tube: This is the horizontal bar between your seat and the handlebars. It affects your ""reach"" towards the handlebars.

Head Tube: This is the small vertical area on the front of your bike, measured between from where it begins to fork around your front wheel and the handlebar stem. It also affects your ""reach"" to the handlebars.

, Stand with your feet six inches apart, and measure up to your pubic bone from the inside of your foot (where your leg meets your hip in your crotch). Take this measurement in centimeters, since all road bikes are measured that way.

, Multiply .67 by your inseam to find you suggested seat tube. If your inseam is 85 centimeters, for example, your seat tube should be 56.95, or 57, centimeters long. The seat tube is usually, though not always, measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft., You're going to hit the inevitable red light, and you need to be able to stand up with your feet on the ground while you wait. Straddle the bike and make sure that you can stand with both feet firmly on the floor. If you can't, you'll need to go down a frame size.

, There are a lot of different formulas out there to figure out the right reach, but the truth of the matter is that everyone is different, and you need to find out what is comfortable for you. When trying out bikes, note the length of the top tube and head tub, as well as the length of the stem -- the smaller piece connecting the handlebars to the frame -- and write down the measurements you like in case you want to buy your bike online.A comfortable reach should:


Let you rest your hands comfortably on the handlebars. Your fingers should be free to wiggle around.
Keep you elbows slightly bent, not locked or pressed up.
Allow you to reach all parts of the handlebars, especially gears and brakes, easily., The lengths of each tube may mean little compared to your final fit, since the angles the frame is joined at affects the distance between the seat, pedals, and handlebars just as much as the size. Studies have shown, for example, that a longer top tube can result in the same fit as a smaller one depending on the length of the head tube.These measurements are starting points as you go shopping, not perfect metrics for the right fit.


Always ask to test out 3-4 brands of bikes, and try out a size above and below the one you measured for. Your personal geometry is unique, so you need a bike that fits you.

, It is easy, especially with curved ""drop"" handlebars, to get your hands lower on the bike. While serious riders often prefect lower handlebars, those who struggle with flexibility or are new to biking almost always prefer a bike with handlebars even to the seat height.


Flat handlebars are rare on road bikes, unless they are designed for cruising or casual riding. It is difficult to go long distances with flat bars.
Drop bars are the classic, double C-shaped handlebars with two front-facing brakes and a variety of places to put your hands for comfort.

, Bike racks allow you to pack things above your back wheel, but not all bikes are compatible with racks. In general, road bikes are not made to handle the weight of a rack, though cross and touring bikes are. Bikes that have two holes at the top of the ""v"" leading from the seat to the back wheel and two more hole in the very back of the frame will allow you to mount a rack.


Panniers are bags designed specifically to clip onto a bike rack, and are essential if you are transporting a lot of goods or want to travel long distances.

Remove the motor by loosening the screws using the proper screwdriver, and wiggling the cylinder-shaped motor until it comes free., Ensure that the new motor that you have chosen is the correct size for your Power Wheels. Remove the brushless motor from your secondary car. It will be cylinder shaped and you may need to remove some hardware to expose the motor.


Wipe the motor clean with a dry rag to remove any buildup of dirt., You may be able to salvage the spade off of the Power Wheels motor by heating it gently and applying some pressure with a flathead screwdriver.If you can’t remove it, purchase an inexpensive spade from your local hardware store rather than potentially ruining the already-connected spade and the actual motor itself.

, Gently push the motor in spade-end first.Using your screwdriver, put the screws back into the hardware to hold the battery in place.


The brushless motor may need some twisting and turning until it is solidly inserted so be patient and don’t try to force it.

, Carefully unwrap the wires from the original motor and re-attach them to the brushless motor following the same connecting points. At this point, a new battery could also be inserted if desired.


Disconnect the battery to avoid getting shocked.

, Your car should be compatible with the remote from the brushless motor. Keep the car upside down as you test to be cautious, as the speed will be greatly increased.

Buy a mountain bike to ride hard over a variety of terrain, not ride quickly.,
Take your inseam measurement to determine frame size.,
Let comfort take precedence over the calculated measurement.,
Decide if your want double or single suspension.,
Get a frame built for bigger wheels for increased comfort and ease on hard trials.",How to Measure and Buy the Correct Bike2," Mountain bikes are made to take a beating and survive. Even city or small town dwellers like them, as they can turn off on dirt paths, crush over curbs, and get a little muddy without worrying about the bike breaking down. That said, a mountain bike's true purpose is to safely bomb up and down trails covered in roots, rocks, and sticks, and they will handle it accordingly.


Trail Bikes are great, all-purpose mountain bikes that can handle light and difficult trails as well as pavement and dirt roads quickly.
All Mountain Bikes are made for hard, technical trails and serious riders.
If you plan on hitting the trials, spending a little extra money will almost always be worth it for safety and comfort.

, Stand with your feet 6 inches apart and measure from the inside of your foot up to where your leg meets your waist, between your crotch and inner thigh, in inches. Multiply this number by .67, then subtract 4"" to 5"" from the answer to get the estimated length of your top tube, which is the part of the frame running from the handlebars to below your seat.Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible, as seat tube (pedal to seat) measurements are tricky to determine and change from manufacturer to manufacturer.If you have a 33 inch inseam, you need a 17.5"" top tube, since:33"" x .67 = 21.75""
21.75"" - 4"" = 17.75


Specialty bike makers Lapierre & Neil Pryde have different geometry. Multiply your inseam by .62 instead of .67 if you really want one of these bikes.If your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length, multiply your inseam by .185. The number should be the distance between the top of your seat tube and the middle of the crankshaft, the circular piece attaching the pedal to the bike., Because the angles your different tubes are joined at affects the distance between the seat, pedals, and handlebars, these measurements will change from bike to bike and rider to rider.Taking measurements is a good starting points, but you need to get the bike you feel most comfortable on. Try out different brands and a size above and below your measured size. You cannot tell if a bike is the right fit if it is the only one you try.


Your hands should rest comfortably on the handlebars so that your fingers feel free.
You want your elbows slightly bent, not locked or pressed up on the handlebars
Most mountain bikers prefer their handlebars 1-2"" lower than their seat height, as it lowers your center of gravity.
You should be able to reach the shifter and brakes without losing your balance on a properly sized bike., All mountain bikes have shock absorbers on the front wheels, allowing you to get over obstacle easily and maneuver in tricky terrain. However, serious bikers need to consider double suspension:



Hardtail: Another name for single suspension, these bikes only have shocks on the front wheel. They are lighter and cheaper options, and transition better to pavement riding.

Full-Suspension: Made for technical, tricky trails, these bikes are heavier but far more maneuverable and useful for serious mountain bikers., Bigger wheels are becoming more and more fashionable, but you cannot swap out smaller wheels if your frame is made for bigger ones. In general, you have three options for wheel size.



29 inch: These behemoth wheels are great at rolling over rocks and roots, have provide more grip to the trail. They carry momentum well downhill, letting your go faster, but they are harder to accelerate.

27.5 inch: A hybrid wheel, they have some of the speed of a classic 26"" with the increased movement over rocks and roots found in a 29"".

26 inch: The traditional wheel size, these are light and speedy wheels that still function well on the trail. Until 5-10 years ago, they were the standard mountain bike wheel."

Buy a bike that fits you skill level but allows room for growth.,
Get a comfort, cruiser, or hybrid bike if you only want to ride occasionally around town.,
Test bikes in person before buying online whenever possible.,
Understand gears and gear ratios.,
Understand the different types of brakes.",How to Measure and Buy the Correct Bike3," Bikes are expensive, and you don't want buy a new one simply because you felt like saving money on the first one. If you're serious about biking, whether it is mountain, road, touring, or commuting, spending a little extra on a good bike now will save you money in the long-term. Ask yourself-- what is your fitness level now, and what do you want it to be? You should get a bike somewhere in the middle.Beginner or intermediate mountain bikers might start with gentle trails that don't require good suspension, but if you love the sport you will quickly want to move up to harder trails that require a better bike.
Road riders might be fine to start with a heavier, cheaper bike, but you'll suffer on group rides or races as you get more experienced.
The frame is the most expensive part of the bike, and should be your first concern. Brakes, gears, wheels, and handlebars can all be swapped out or upgraded later. That said, good components resist wear and tear and lead to smoother riding.

, These bikes come in a variety of shapes and purposes, but they share one thing in common -- they aren't made for long distances. If mountain or road bikes seem too specific for you, you should try out the following bikes instead. They usually come in standardized measurements (S, M, L, XL), so pick one that lets you comfortable reach the handlebars. Your knee should be slightly bent at the bottom of your pedal stroke.Fixed Gear: Simple, light bikes made almost entirely for urban cruising, they offer you no extra gears. They are easy to maintain and ride, though they perform best on flat terrain.

Cruiser: Also known as ""beach bikes"" or ""comfort bikes,"" these bikes are made for comfort, with high handlebars that let you ride almost completely upright.

Hybrids: Great commuting or urban bikes, hybrids have bigger tires than road bikes but similar geometry, keeping them light and speedy while allowing you get over bumps and cracks with ease.

, Shopping for bikes online is a great way to get the perfect bike for you and potentially save money, but you should never by a bike online without testing it out beforehand. Once you've narrowed down your search to 3-4 types of bike, call you local bike shops and see if they have them in stock. Head down and try them out to make sure they fit you well and ride comfortably before buying.


Online reviews are a great place to get a feel for a bike. Check out online bike blogs and magazines and see what they think of the bikes, and read customer testimonials to see if there are any persistent issues with the bike that you want to avoid.

, Gearing may seem confusing, but you should remember that it comes down to two factors. First, more gears means more options when riding, allowing you to find the perfect resistance going up or down hills. Gears, however, add to the weight of the bike, which is not desirable if you are racer or mountain rider heading uphill a lot.


The classic gearing for both road and mounting bikes is 3 gears in the front and 9 in the back, resulting in a 27 speed bike.'Compact cranks are smaller, lighter gears in the front, giving you only two big chainrings to get into but cutting down on weight.

, There are two large subdivisions of brakes -- rim brakes and disc brakes. Almost all mountain bikes, aside from entry level, use disc, while road bikes have much more variety.



Rim Brakes come in many forms, but they all function by clamping onto the rim of your wheel and holding it in place to slow you down. There are two big pads on either side of both wheel the squeeze when you let go. They are cheaper and easier to fix and maintain than discs.

Disc breaks rely on a separate steel disc attached to your wheel that the brakes grab in order to slow down the entire wheel. They are often more sensitive than rim brakes, and the tight space between the breaks prevents sticks,leaves, etc. from catching on the brakes and ruining them mid-ride. They are, however, harder to manage and calibrate without prior knowledge.

Choose an aftermarket battery.,
Pry off the top of the original battery from the side using a flathead screwdriver.After the top cracks, use the screwdriver to pull the edges off the top away from the battery.,
Pull the battery connecter away from the battery.,
Connect the fuse to the positive side of the battery connector.,
Insulate all exposed remaining wires.,
Insert the connector into the replacement battery.,
Test your new battery.",How to Make Your Powerwheels Faster2," When choosing a battery, look for information on your Power Wheels battery to guide you on the exact specifications. You must note the voltage, chemistry, and size. For example: Fisherbrand Power Wheels batteries are often lead based, 12 Volt and are 16.0 x 11.0 x 8.0 so you must ensure ensure that the aftermarket battery you choose matches these specifications. The advantage to after-market batteries are that they are inexpensive compared to the Power Wheels brand batteries., Completely remove the top piece but be gentle to avoid damaging the casing of the battery.


Stay away from the black connector inside the battery as this will be used to hook-up your new battery to your Power Wheels car. It will need to be replaced if you unintentionally damage it.

, After some wiggling, the connector will pop up and out of the rest of the battery. Pull the two attached positive and negative wires out as far as you can, and then gently clip them as close to the battery as possible.Use wire cutters or crimpers to ensure a clean, crisp cut. these are available for only a few dollars at your local hardware store.After the connecter has been disconnected, recycle your battery at the recycling depot. Batteries contain a large amount of nasty chemicals and are harmful to the environment., Insert a 30 Amp fuse into a fuse holder. Once connected, strip approximately 1 cm of wire cover from each side of the connector using your wire crimping tool. Insert the exposed wire into a wire connector and crimp down on the wire connector to hold the wire firmly in place.


The positive side of the connector will be white or red.
After crimping the wire connector, insert the one wire from the fuse to the other side of the battery connector. Crimp down to connect the fuse to the battery connector.
Fuses, fuse holders and wire connector are available at local hardware stores., Attach an insulated female spade to the negative wire of the battery connector (often black) and the remaining exposed fuse wire.Female spade connectors come in many different styles. To save time, take your aftermarket battery with you to the store and compare the male components located on the battery terminals to the positive connectors in the store.

, Connect the negative battery terminal (black) to the negative wire of the connector (also black). Connect the positive terminal (red) to the fuse end of the connector., Be cautious and place your car upside as the speed will be greatly increased.

The hood release can usually be found near the door on the driver’s side of the vehicle.With the hood released, you will also need to release the safety latch located at the front of the vehicle.
If you are having difficulty locating the hood release or safety latch, refer to your owner’s manual for guidance.;
, You should always disconnect your battery before starting an automotive project. Use the appropriate sized wrench or socket to loosen the nut holding the black ground cable on the negative terminal of the battery.Slide the cable off of the terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery.
You will not need to disconnect the positive terminal.

, Depending on the engine in your vehicle, the serpentine belt may be located at the front of the engine bay, or it may be along one side. There may be engine covers in the way, so be prepared to remove them if need be.Engine covers may be held in place by plastic clips, so take care not to break them as you remove the covers.
If you cannot find your serpentine belt, refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle.

, Once you have located the serpentine belt, inspect it visually for signs of damage. If the belt is frayed, coming apart, or has marks that indicate that it has been rubbing on something, it will need to be replaced. It is usually easy to determine if a belt needs to be replaced, as they tend to crack or lose chunks when they are overworn.Most serpentine belts need to be replaced every 40,000 to 70,000 miles.
If there are signs of the belt rubbing on something, make sure to identify and repair whatever it was rubbing on to avoid damaging the new belt.

, Many cars come with a sticker in the engine bay that shows exactly how the serpentine belt is supposed to be routed through the various pulleys on the engine. If your vehicle does not have a sticker, you will need to find another way to remember how the belt should be run.Look in the owner’s or service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle for a diagram.
You can also take a picture of the existing belt with your cell phone to use as a guide when installing the new one.

, Depending on the application, your serpentine belt will either have tension placed on it using a movable bracket or an auto tensioner pulley. This pulley uses an internal spring to apply consistent pressure to the belt at all times.If your vehicle does not have a tensioner pulley, the alternator bracket is likely how tension is set on the belt.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual to confirm what type of tensioner your vehicle uses if you aren’t sure.

, Auto tensioners have either a hole that will fit a half inch drive ratchet, or a bolt you can use a socket to apply pressure to. Insert the wrench or place the socket over the bolt on the tensioner and twist it away from the belt to relieve the tension on it.Depending on the positioning of the tensioner pulley you may need to twist the tensioner clockwise or counterclockwise.
Be sure to use the right size socket to avoid stripping the bolt head on the tensioner.

, If your vehicle uses the alternator bracket to apply tension to the belt, loosen the two bolts that pass through the long eyelets on the bracket. As you loosen the bolts, the tension on the belt will likely move the alternator toward the engine and relieve the pressure.Loosen the bolts enough to move the alternator, but don’t remove them.

, With the tension relieved from the belt, pull it off of the pulley that has been placing tension on it, then remove it from the around the rest of the pulleys on the engine.If the belt is severely damaged, be sure to remove any parts that may have come off of it as well.

, Look at the new belt in comparison to the old one to be sure they are the same width and have the same number of ribs going across the belt horizontally. The old belt may be slightly longer than the new one due to stretching.If the new belt is not the same width as the old one, it is the wrong belt.
Make sure the new belt doesn’t show any signs of damage from the factory or it may tear after you install it.

, Run the new belt through the pulleys in exactly the same way the old one was. Refer to the belt diagram in your vehicle’s owner’s manual or the picture you took of the belt before removing it to guide you.The belt should be long enough to route around all of the pulleys except the tensioner until you relieve the pressure on it.
If the belt is loose after routing it, it is either the wrong size belt or you’ve routed it incorrectly.

, Use the same wrench to loosen the auto tensioner pulley, then pull the belt over it. Once the belt is in place, release the pressure on the tensioner so it holds the belt in place.It may be difficult to apply pressure to the tensioner and route the belt, so you may want to ask a friend to help.

, If your vehicle does not have an auto tensioner, insert a pry bar or piece of wood between the alternator and the engine. Run the belt over the alternator pulley, then use the bar to pry the alternator away from the engine and increase the tension on the belt. Tighten the bolts again as you apply tension.You may need help tightening the bolts as you apply pressure to the alternator.
Be careful not to pry against anything plastic in your engine bay to avoid breaking anything.

Listen.,
If the car runs, then stand on the side of the car where the pulleys are and try to distinguish where the noise is coming from.,
If the car doesn't run and you are going to be the one doing the work, then remove your front accessories enough to get to the front cover.,
With the cover off, check for the free movement of all the idler pulleys and the tension itself.,
While you are in there, it is smart to just get a timing belt kit and replace all the pulleys and the belt.

,
Make sure that you line up all your marks and set the proper tension on the belt.

",How to Tell if a Timing Belt Tensioner Is Bad," A bad tensioner will usually be accompanied by noise. This noise could be some type of squealing or rattling coming from the timing cover area. Also, when your timing belt is loose, it will cause some drivability issues usually under high load or high rpm. If your timing belt is not properly tensioned it will not keep the valves timed properly to the lower end and this will cause misfires, loss of power, bucking, and could even cause a no start condition.;
, If you hear the noise coming from the front of the engine and it is not coming from your accessories, you may hear the belt flapping around due to the loss of tension.

, Once done, remove the front cover and check to see how loose the belt is. There should be a little slack on the opposite side of the tensioner, but not much.

, It will be very apparent if something is broken.

,,"
"
Determine repair parts needed: All moving parts are subject to failure and you may need to remove the serpentine belt to replace the belt itself or one of the components it drives.,
Park the vehicle in a level spot and set the emergency brake.,
Raise the hood of the vehicle's engine compartment and set the hood brace to keep it open, if so equipped.

,
Engine caution: Remove the negative battery cable connector from the battery terminal to be sure that no one will be able to actuate the engine or starter.

,
Look for a diagram decal posted near the front of the engine compartment that lays out the serpentine belt.,
Locate the serpentine belt auto tensioner pulley using the diagram.,
After letting the engine cool thoroughly, use one of the tools mentioned below to pivot the tensioner pulley to take the tension off the belt.,
Serious damage caution.,
Caution against injury: Be careful to neither let the tool slip nor release the tool handle suddenly or it could sling the tool, and damage the auto or possibly cause serious injury.

,
Push or pull, logically: You may push down on the tool handle -- if the belt is over the tensioner pulley -- or pull up, if the belt passes under the tension pulley (but not necessarily, as that direction depends on the design and orientation of the tensioner and the belt).,
Hold the tension from the belt, and slip the belt off the auto tensioner pulley to remove the belt and pulley system.

,
Slowly release the tension to avoid damage or injury, and then remove the tool from the belt auto tensioner.

,
Carefully examine the pattern as you remove the belt from the remaining pulleys, to be sure that you understand the routing of the belt for replacing it later in reverse sequence.",How to Remove a Serpentine Belt Using Auto Tensioner,";
, Turn the engine off and chock the rear wheels for both directions.

,,, Most likely, it will be mounted on the top of the radiator shroud or cover. If there is not a diagram, be sure to get one, such as in a repair manual or draw one carefully and clearly.

, The auto tensioner and its pulley is a spring-loaded device that keeps the serpentine belt tight. Its pulley is usually smooth while the other pulleys are grooved. The way to remove tension will be to pivot the tensioner using a tool (1) on the nut of the tensioner pulley, or (2) a special tool-lug outcropping from the tensioner or (3) in a square opening in the bracket of the tensioner pulley, cover or cap that protects the spring. (There is often an idler pulley in the system which looks rather similar to the tensioner pulley -- but it is not a tensioning device, not spring loaded.)

,


Remove any belt guard, cover or fan cowling as necessary -- for instance on a belt driven fan on some rear-wheel-drive vehicles (on older cars, on trucks, etc.) to more easily access the belts, but replace it all later.
Remove a under engine splash-guard/cover, if necessary (these protect belts and accessories, electronics, etc.): this is found under the vehicle -- to gain access to bottom pulleys. It may be attached with plastic snap in retainers or screws or both. Be sure to put all such covers back on later.

, Do ""not"" cut the belt: Avoid such a ""short cut"", as that can cause the tensioner or where it attaches to be damaged when it springs back violently.



Using the ""universal"" hexagon (hex) nut type: Select a socket wrench, a combination or adjustable wrench and insert it over the pulley hex nut (you may need a ""cheater pipe"" to slip over the wrench handle to lengthen it and give you more leverage). Often a ratchet and socket is to thick to fit (Chrysler products have used the universal hex-nut on the tensioner pulley) in the narrow space between the engine and chassis or front fender, on front wheel drive engines. Then a box end wrench or special, rented, long-handled tool may be used.

Patented lug feature: Use an open end wrench on a patented ""tensioner rigid lug"" that accepts an open end wrench, available only with certain manufacturers' engines.

Patented square opening feature: Use a bare 3/8 inch (9.52 mm) extension attached to a 3/8 inch (9.52 mm) ratchet with a cheater, or use a long handled ""breaker/break-over"" wrench, inserting it (without a socket) into the square opening -- General Motors (GM) vehicles have this patented method -- in the tensioner lever or bracket.

Borrow or rent: Get a thin, flat, long-handled, serpentine belt removal tool (or kit with various size low profile sockets and ""crow-feet"", open-end attachments) at an auto parts store. Follow the instructions in your manual, or a sheet that may come with the tool (or ask for advice from an experienced ""handy-man"").

,,


Note: It is a very heavy spring tension, and pivoting the tensioner is often not possible with a short handled tool.

,,, If it is not to be reused -- or would be in your way such as while installing a water pump or such -- remove it from the engine compartment.


Operating caution: Not any of the belt driven accessories (such as the engine coolant system, air conditioner, heater and power steering) will operate without the belt, so do not run the engine at all.

Ensure your vehicle is equipped with a neoprene belt.,
Open the hood.,
Locate the fan belt.,
Start the vehicle.,
Spray the belt dressing directly onto the belt.",How to Quiet a Noisy Fan Belt1," Most modern vehicles have a serpentine belt instead of a fan belt, though the names may be used interchangeably. Older model vehicles and some high performance applications still utilize fan belts instead of electric fans. Older belts were made of neoprene and would benefit from the application of belt dressing, but newer EPDM-made belts may dry out as a result of using belt dressing.If your fan belt was installed after the year 2000, it is likely an EPDM-made belt.
The two belts are difficult to tell apart visually until they are worn out and need to be replaced.;
, You will need to apply the belt dressing directly onto the belt. In order to do so, you will need to open the hood of the vehicle and remove any cowl cover that may be in place over the fan belt itself. This may require the use of some basic hand tools like a socket or hand wrench.Some vehicles have engine covers that will need to be removed.
You will need direct line of sight and access to the belt while the engine is running.

, The fan belt will likely be located at the front of the engine, attached to a pulley that rotates the cooling fan or fans for the radiator. It will often be black or grey. You may be able to locate it faster by starting at the radiator fan and working backward.In many older American vehicles, the fan belt is connected to shaft with a large metal fan at the end and is easy to identify.
Serpentine or accessory belts that serve the same function as a fan belt may be on the side of a horizontally mounted engine.

, Ensure the vehicle is in park with the parking brake engaged, then start the engine. You will need the engine to be running in order to apply the belt dressing evenly over the entire length of the belt.Leave the hood open and engine covers removed when starting the engine.

, With the engine running, spray the belt dressing directly onto the back of the fan belt. As the engine runs, the fan belt will be moving quickly, so you can leave the can in one place and spray onto the belt as it spins.Spray the belt dressing onto the belt until the entire belt is wet.
The squeaking from the fan belt should stop almost immediately.

"
"
Inspect the belt for misalignment.,
Identify signs of damage or excessive wear.,
Locate the tensioner pulley.,
Replace the tensioner pulley.,
Tighten the tensioner.",How to Quiet a Noisy Fan Belt2," A common cause of noisy fan belts is a slight misalignment of the belt on the pulleys. With the hood open, examine the belt to ensure it is mounted on the top most pulley completely straight. If you are unsure, place a tape measure along the pulley to provide yourself with a frame of reference.If the belt is offset even slightly, it will cause squeaking, squealing or chirping.
A belt that is not properly aligned with wear out faster.

, If your belt needs to be replaced, it will often become noisy as a result of the wear or damage. Shine a light on the belt and look at it closely. If there are any visible cracks or chunks of belt missing, the belt should be replaced immediately.Modern EPDM-made belts are designed to last up to 100,000 miles before being replaced, but may wear prematurely due to misalignment or unusual driving conditions.
Neoprene belts must be replaced every 30,000 to 60,000 miles.

, Some vehicles come equipped with a tensioner pulley that applies tension to the serpentine or fan belts. If you are unsure if your vehicle came equipped with a tensioner pulley, refer to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle.The tensioner pulley is often bolted directly to the engine block and has an opening that will fit a ½ inch drive ratchet.
Not all vehicles come equipped with a tensioner pulley.

, If the tensioner pulley (or auto tensioner) is too worn out to be able to apply sufficient tension to the belt, you will need to replace it. You should not be able to press on the pulley to relieve belt tension by hand. If you are able to, the tensioner must be replaced. Most tensioners are held in place using only one or two bolts.Remove the old tensioner by removing the bolts passing through it and into the engine block.
You may want to replace the belt at the same time due to any damage that may have resulted from the loose tensioner.

, In some vehicles, the belt tension is established by an adjustable bracket on an accessory such as the alternator. In these cases, loosen the two bolts that pass through the adjustable eyelet on the bracket. Slide a pry bar between the alternator and the engine block and pry the alternator away from the engine with the belt over the pulley. Maintain that tension while you tighten the two bolts you loosened in the eyelets.This task may be easier to accomplish with a friend helping maintain the tension on the belt.
Be careful to ensure the belt is completely straight on the pulley.

"
"
Purchase a replacement belt.,
Relieve the tension on the belt.,
Remove the belt from the engine.,
Install the new belt.,
Apply tension to the belt.",How to Quiet a Noisy Fan Belt3," You can purchase a replacement belt from your local auto parts store. Make sure to provide them with the exact year, make and model of the vehicle as well as engine size so you receive the correct replacement belt.It is recommended that you use an EPDM style belt to replace your old one.
Compare your new belt to the old one to ensure the new belt is the proper length and width.

, If your vehicle came equipped with an auto tensioner pulley, it can usually be loosened by inserting the end of a ½ inch drive ratchet into the hole at the center of the pulley. In some vehicles, it may be a bolt head you will need to locate the proper size wrench to turn. Twist the pulley clockwise to bend the tensioner arm down and remove the tension from the belt.If the belt tension is held in place using the alternator bracket, loosen the bolts that pass through the eyelets on the bracket to relieve the belt tension.

, Make note of how the belt is run through the engine. If it is strictly for use on the fan, it will have very few twists and turns, but if it is a more modern serpentine belt design, it may need to pass through and around a number of pulleys. Your vehicle’s service or owner’s manuals should provide a diagram on how the belt is to be run, but you still may want to get a good look at it before removing it.If you do not have a diagram of how the belt should be run, take a picture of the old belt with your phone before removing it.

, Run the new belt through the pulleys in the same way the previous one was. Be sure the belt fits onto each pulley evenly and in a completely straight line to avoid damaging the belt and making lots of noise.Refer to the owner’s or service manual for your specific vehicle to be sure you’ve run the fan or serpentine belt correctly.
Running the belt at an angle will result in loud squealing. Be sure it is mounted flat and evenly.

, With the new belt in place, relieve the tension you have applied to the auto tensioner to secure it. In vehicles equipped with a bracket to apply tension, insert a pry bar between the bracket and the block and pry it away from the engine. Tighten the eyelet bolts with tension applied.Visually inspect the new belt to ensure it is straight.
Start the vehicle to check for squealing.

Remove the floor mats.,
Use your vacuum’s brush attachment.,
Vacuum the floorboards thoroughly.,
Go over the upholstery.,
Clean the floor mats.,
Use compressed air to dislodge difficult debris.,
Touch up your dashboard and displays.,
Don’t forget about the trunk.",How to Vacuum a Car," A standard household vacuum cleaner may not have the reach or flexibility you need to get down into narrow crevices of your car’s interior. Your best bet is to use a high powered wet/dry vacuum with an extendable hose. One of these vacuums will give you all the suction you need while also being more maneuverable.Consider purchasing a dedicated car vacuum, which is designed to fit easily into hard-to-reach spots inside automobiles.An extension cord may come in handy for helping you reach your vehicle with the vacuum if there’s not an outlet nearby.;
, Leaving the doors open while you vacuum will provide convenient access to every part of the car’s interior. Otherwise, you’ll have no choice but to repeatedly open and close various doors to be able to get to different areas of the car.With the doors open, you’ll be able to pull the vacuum straight through rather than being forced to circle around the car.
Opening the doors also creates ventilation, which will help air out stale, musty odors.

, Take a few extra moments to get rid of any disposable materials you happen to find before you begin vacuuming. It will make the whole process go faster, since there won’t be anything to get in the way of the vacuum. Your vehicle will also be left looking much tidier when you’re finished.








Grab a large garbage bag so that you’ll have something to throw waste items into as you go.This is a good opportunity to toss out or find a better place for belongings that you no longer need to carry around in your car., Since they’re directly underfoot, most vehicles’ floor mats receive the brunt of the abuse on a regular basis. It will therefore be easiest to deal with them separately later on. Go ahead and lift the floor mats out of the front and back seats of your car and set them aside in a clean, dry area.








Make sure to work the floor mats free from any snaps, hooks or eyelets that may be securing them in place.
Don’t forget about other mats and covers, such as removable trunk liners.

, Suction alone isn’t always enough to lift tiny particles out of plush textile surfaces.The bristles of the brush will stir up dust and debris from deep within your car’s carpet so it can be sucked up by the vacuum with little difficulty. The result will be a much deeper and more thorough clean.








A circular brush head will be able to access a wider variety of spaces, but a wide brush should also get the job done.
If you don’t happen to have a brush attachment, try using a separate stiff-bristled brush. Go over the carpet and upholstery with one hand before following up with the vacuum., For best results, suction the carpet in all directions, working from the console side to the outer edge of the seats. Make multiple passes until the floorboards are completely free of dirt, then repeat in the back of the car.








Slide the driver and passenger’s side seats back as far as they’ll go so you’ll have more room to work.Concentrate on areas where debris has a tendency to collect, like the seat track rails and underneath the pedals., Run the vacuum along the seats and seat backs to eliminate trapped dust, hair and other debris. It will help to use your brush or brush attachment here. Sweep the bristles down deep into cracks and crevices and let the vacuum’s powerful suction take care of the rest.








Recline the front seats all the way to expose more of the section between the seat and seat back.

, Take the floor mats you removed earlier and shake them out or bang them against a wall or another hard surface to loosen stuck-on messes. You can then vacuum the tops of the mats to fluff up the fibers. Double check that there’s no leaves, rocks or other debris clinging to the underside of the mats before reinstalling them.








Treat spills and discoloration on your floor mats with a stain remover, then hang them up outside to air dry.
All-weather floor mats made from leather of synthetic materials can simply be hosed off or wiped down by hand., When you come across nooks and crannies that are too tight for the vacuum, a gust of compressed air can send dirt and dust particles airborne, where they can then be suctioned up. Make sure you release the air in short bursts—if you hold down the nozzle for too long, it will just blow the dust around the inside of the cabin.You can find canisters of compressed air at most supermarkets, drug stores and auto parts retailers.
Another alternative is to hook the hose of the vacuum up the the outlet port and use it to gently blow the debris out of its hiding spot., These surfaces are often neglected while vacuuming, but they can sometimes hold more than their fair share of dust. Brush the area lightly using short, sweeping strokes and hold the vacuum close to catch the dust it releases. Break down stuck-on residue with a damp rag or detailing wipe.








Be careful not to be too rough when going over the display covers. These are typically made from soft transparent plastic, and it’s possible to leave scratches if you make contact with the vacuum hose itself.If you’re in a hurry, you can also dust a dash or display by hand with a soft, dry cloth and a spritz of dusting spray., While you’re at it, pop the trunk and take a quick peek inside to see what kind of shape it’s in. The trunk is one of the most commonly overlooked parts of most cars, so it’s likely that it hasn’t been cleaned in a while. Do away with trash and miscellaneous clutter, then give the entire compartment a good vacuuming from top to bottom. 








When you’re done vacuuming, be sure to dust, suction, spray off or wipe down removable trunk mats and liners.
Your trunk can get dirtier at a faster rate than the rest of your vehicle if you routinely lug around tools, dirty shoes, camping gear or sports equipment."

Understand the enemy.,
Scrape off any excess oil or grease.,
Blot the stain.,
Apply baking soda to the stain.,
Remove the baking soda.,
Clean the carpet with dry cleaning solvent if residual stains remain.,
Scrub with a degreaser.,
Steam the stained area.",How to Remove Grease and Oil From a Car's Interior1," Whether you rubbed oil or grease on your interior ultimately doesn’t matter for cleanup purposes. Here’s why:


Oils are defined as any compounds that are insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents (non-polar things like gasoline), and liquid at room temperature.Grease, on the other hand, is simply an oil that has additives to make it semi-solid (kind of like Jell-O) at room temperature. These additives are solid and do not absorb into the surfaces inside your car.This means that, once you scrape off any excess contaminants from the surface of your interior, the stain left behind is an oil stain.
Cleaning oil from cloth seats requires the same process you would use to clean it from carpet.;
, You can use a paint scraper, spoon, or knife. It doesn’t matter if you use metal or plastic, but be cautious not to puncture your seat., This will remove any residual oil or grease that is left sitting on the surface of your interior. Use a dry paper towel or shop towel to do this., This will soak up the oil. Allow the baking soda to sit for 10-15 minutes., You can vacuum it up with a shopvac or sweep it up. If there is a large amount of oil, you might put more baking soda on the stain and repeat this cycle several times., If there is any stain left, you can repeat the process as long as you continue to see improvement. Instructions for sponging and blotting with a particular dry cleaner will be included on the manufacturer's bottle. Once you can no longer tell that this method is making a difference, you should move on to another method., A detergent such as Dawn is often enough to break up oil stains, especially fresh ones. You can also buy other over the counter grease/oil removers such as Goo Gone. This is the most common and straightforward way to remove a grease or oil stain., If a degreaser didn’t knock out the stain, you may need to use steam to coax it out. The steam will heat the fibers of your carpet and open up any pores in the fiber. This allows the carpet to “release” any trapped oil and gives you the chance to soak it up.


You can use a traditional steam cleaner to do this job.
If you do not have a steam cleaner, you can place a brown paper bag over the stain to absorb the oils. Then, apply steam by putting a clothing iron on top of the bag to create the heat and steam to free the oils."

Remove excess grease or oil from the surface of your leather.,
Mix a degreasing solution.,
Clean the affected area.,
Use a wet towel to remove the cleaner.",How to Remove Grease and Oil From a Car's Interior2," Scraping and blotting steps above to make sure that you get as much grease/oil off of the surface before trying to clean it.

, Most commonly, this will mean adding a dish detergent such as Dawn to warm water and agitating to mix. You can also buy other over the counter grease/oil removers specific to leather. This is the most common and straightforward way to remove a grease or oil stain., Thoroughly scrub the affected spot with your degreasing solution and a microfiber towel or rag. If you notice any of the color of your leather transfer onto the rag, stop immediately and allow the area to dry before resuming., Again, distilled water is best for this, but tap water will work. Be sure that no lather or soapy residue is left behind. The soapy residue will collect dirt."
"
Mix up a baking soda paste.,
Scrub the affected area with your paste.,
Remove the paste with a wet towel.,
Repeat this process.",How to Remove Grease and Oil From a Car's Interior3," If the degreaser alone didn’t work, or you feel you need to deodorize a bit, you can mix ⅜ cup of warm water, 1 tablespoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of flour, and ⅛ cup of sea salt to make a cleaning paste. Add all of the ingredients to a bowl and mix until you have a paste.

, The baking soda paste provides a bit more friction than most degreasers. This can help if you have a stain that requires a lot of scrubbing. Use a rag, or preferably a microfiber towel, to scrub the paste into the affected spot. If it is a small spot, or a spot with a lot of crevices you can use a toothbrush to better scrub the area.

, Use a wet towel or microfiber towel to wipe away the cleaning solution and the grease. For this you need only use water, distilled water is best as it contains fewer contaminants that might leave water spots.

, If the stain isn’t completely removed after the first cleaning, repeat this process until the stain is gone.

"
"
Follow the step above for mixing a degreasing solution.,
Choose a sponge or scrub brush.,
Scrub the area.,
Do a final wipe with distilled water.",How to Remove Grease and Oil From a Car's Interior4," This should be treated similarly to the leather. Do not use a thinner or stripper such as toluene or lacquer thinner. This can damage your plastic.

, Be sure that the sponge or brush bristles are not so coarse that they will scratch your plastic. A toothbrush can be used for small or hard to reach areas.

, Dip your chosen cleaning utensil into the solution and get to scrubbing. If you work up a leather, you can wipe it away with a paper towel or other rag.

, If you do not have distilled water, tap water will work. This step will remove the cleaners and any oils that they lifted from the surface of your plastic.

"
Vacuum or scrape the area.,
Blot the stain.,
Apply commercial stain remover.,
Rinse the area.,
Dry the area.",How to Clean Car Upholstery Stains1," In order to understand the extent of the stain, and exactly what it consists of if you don't know, you should scrape or vacuum the area. Also, in order to avoid spreading it around further once you start cleaning, this allows you to remove whatever you can while it is dry. Use a car vacuum cleaner or a dull scrapper, such as a butter knife, to detach any dried residue that you can.

Some stains will not have any dried residue that can be removed. Use your judgement about whether scraping or vacuuming will remove anything.;
, In general, it's a good idea to avoid rubbing or brushing a stain, as this can drive it further into the upholstery. Instead, blot the area with a rag or paper towel repeatedly.Blot the area until the stain no longer transfers onto your paper towel or cloth.

, There are a variety of products available for cleaning upholstery. Pick one designed for your type of stain and your type of upholstery, and follow the directions on the packaging.With commercial stain removers, it's important to test the cleaner in an inconspicuous spot before using it on the stain. This will assure that the product doesn't stain or discolor your upholstery.

, After you have removed the stain, you should rinse the area with a small amount of clean water. This will remove the cleaner and get rid of any remaining debris in the area.

Rinsing can be done by getting a cloth wet, wringing it out, and then dabbing it on the stained area. This will rinse the upholstery fibers without adding too much water to the surface.

, Use paper towels or a towel to remove any remaining moisture from the stain area. Press on the area and absorb as much liquid as you can. Use dry areas of your towel to get even more liquid out of the stain area.

Once you have removed as much moisture as possible with your towel, allow the area to air dry completely.

"
"
Absorb some of the stain with baking soda.,
Use detergent and vinegar to clean dirty areas.,
Use isopropyl rubbing alcohol on ink stains.,
Apply dishwashing soap to grease stains.,
Clean coffee stains and blood stains with cold water.",How to Clean Car Upholstery Stains2," If you have a stained area, you can begin cleaning it up by removing as much as possible with baking soda. Baking soda will absorb a variety of stain-causing compounds, including greases such as motor oil.Sprinkle the baking soda over the surface of the stain. Make sure you have a thick enough coating so that as much of the stain as possible is absorbed.

, Try a mixture of a tablespoon of dish-washing detergent, one cup vinegar, and one gallon of warm water. This mixture will work on many types of stains, including some stubborn greasy stains.Although mixing detergent and vinegar together is safe, be careful when mixing other household cleaners together. There are some combinations, such as bleach and vinegar, that can be toxic if mixed together., Ink stains can be hard to remove from upholstery, so you need to use the right supplies. Instead of using soap and water, which is commonly used to clean stains, try blotting the area with rubbing alcohol. This will lift the stain much better.Use a cloth or a cotton ball to apply the alcohol to the stain.
Hairspray can be sprayed directly onto the stain in a pinch, because it tends to have a high concentration of alcohol in it.

, Dishwashing soap is made to cut through the grease that coats your pots, pans, and dishes. This makes it very helpful when trying to clean a grease stain from other items, such as car upholstery.Dab a little bit of the soap directly onto the upholstery stain and dab the area with a wet cloth.

, There are certain stains that can be especially hard to get out of fabric fibers once they are set. For instance, blood stains and coffee stains can be especially troublesome. To get them out, blot the area with very cold water, as hot water can set the stain. Repeated blotting with very cold water will remove most minor blood or coffee stains. If your stain is not removed, try adding a few drops of detergent or a splash of club soda directly to the stain. Then continue to blot with very cold water.

Ensure the engine is completely cool.,
Jack up the front of the car.,
Raise the hood and locate the radiator.,
Ensure the existing radiator works properly and is in good working order.,
Center a drainage pan underneath the radiator's drainage valve, or petcock.,
Drain the radiator by pulling out the petcock.,
Flush the radiator with water.,
Add new coolant up to the fill line.,
Bleed the radiator of any air pockets.",How to Flush a Radiator," You will not be able to work otherwise. The engine is coolest when it has not been operated for at least two hours. This step is vitally important as coolant in a recently-used engine can be extremely hot and can cause injury if it comes in contact with your skin.;
, While not strictly necessary, raising the front of you car makes it easier to work underneath the radiator and helps eliminate air bubbles from your coolant when you flush the radiator., The radiator is usually near the front of the car next to the engine. Clean the metal slats on the front and back of the radiator that allow air to move throughout (otherwise known as fins) with soapy water and a nylon brush. Brush in the direction of the radiator fins to remove dirt and grim (not against -- this may cause damage the fins).It may not be possible to clean the slats, as the A/C condenser is sometimes mounted in front of the radiator, blocking the slats.

, Look for large patches of rust, corrosion, or leaky pipes and hoses. If, for example, you can smell antifreeze while driving, you may need to take you car in for a larger fix than simply flushing.The radiator cap acts as a lid for the radiator keeping it pressurized. It consists of a spring coil stretched between a wide flat metal top and a rubber seal. The tension between the seal and the spring is what allows the radiator to maintain the proper pressure. If any part is worn out, the cap may need to be replaced.
Two hoses run from the radiator. The top hose is where hot coolant enters the radiator, and the lower hose is where cooled coolant enters the engine via the coolant pump. Ensure that neither hose is collapsed, as this will prevent coolant from flowing properly.

, Petcock's come in various shapes and sizes, but they are all small plugs that you can pull out to drain away fluid. Put a pan underneath the petcock to catch all of the fluid when you drain it.


The petcock is usually attached to the bottom of one of the radiator tanks and is the only bolt you will find there.
You may need to remove a small plastic covering from beneath the radiator to get to the drainage valve. This can be done with a screwdriver., Make sure you are wearing work gloves for this step as radiator coolant is toxic. Once you have drained the coolant, put a lid on your drainage pan and set aside.


Take your fluid to a nearby mechanic to be recycled., Draining your radiator will only remove above 40-50% of your old coolant, so you need to flush it with water to get the rest out. To do so:


Replace the petcock in the radiator.
Place a garden hose in the fill spout and fill it until you see the water line.
Start the car and leave it on for 10 minutes. Let the car cool before returning to it.
Remove the petcock and let the new water drain out into a pan. This water will be tainted by the toxic coolant still in the radiator, so it must be recycled as well. Do not allow this water to drain into the ground.
Repeat this process 2-3 times.You can also buy ""radiator flush cleaning solutions"" to add with the water for a cleaner radiator. Make sure you drain all of the solution before refilling with coolant., An ideal coolant consists of 50% distilled water and 50% antifreeze. Combine the two ingredients together in a large bucket before pouring them into the radiator. Make sure you buy the appropriate coolant for your car.


Check your owner's manual for coolant suggestions, or bring your car's make, model, and year information to your local auto shop for advice. Be sure to note how much coolant you need -- this can range from 6-18 quarts.
Most cars use green coolant, but Toyota cars specifically need red. Orange coolant is newer and supposedly has a longer lifespan, but it is best to use the same coolant each time you change it.Mixing coolants can cause coagulation of the coolant, leading to costly repairs.

, Take off the radiator cap to allow the air to escape, then turn the car on. Leave it running for 15 minutes with the heater turned on, allowing all air voids to exit the radiator. This will make more room for coolant, so be sure to add more coolant up to the fill line again.

Wearing latex gloves can make it much easier to clean up after you’re done working on the car, but may not be necessary for this job.;
, It’s important that you make sure the car is in park and turned off before beginning the process of replacing your battery cables. You will be working with the car’s electrical system, so leaving it running could increase the likelihood of you receiving an electrical shock and could possibly do damage to the vehicle.Remove the keys from the ignition to make sure no one can accidentally try to start it while you’re working under the hood.
If your car is a standard, make sure the parking break is engaged instead of having the car in park.

, Different automakers place the batteries in their cars in different locations for a number of reasons. Most car batteries can be located near the front or nose of the car on the left or right. It looks like a large, usually black box with two metal terminals sticking out of the top, each with cables attached. Make sure the hood struts can support the weight of the hood before you release it, otherwise it could fall and hurt you. If you cannot locate the battery under the hood of the car, it may be in the trunk.Some automakers place the battery in the trunk to improve weight distribution or save space.
If you cannot locate your battery, refer to your owner’s manual. It will show you how to locate and access your battery.

, Once you have located the battery, you will need to differentiate between the positive and negative terminals. Car battery cables are usually colored to match their use: red cables are positive, black cables are negative. In some cases, the wires may both be black, but they will have red and black boxes or accents at the ends of the cable.If there are no discernible colors visible, you can easily determine which is the negative cable by following them from the battery to the other end. Negative cables bolt directly to the body of the car or engine block, positive cables attach to the starter.
The battery will have labels marked with a + and a – sign. The plus is the positive cable terminal, the – is the negative.

, You will often find other wires attached to a battery cable using electric tape (particularly on the positive side). Sometimes these wires are held in place more securely using metal or plastic retainers. Do not remove these wires, but cut off any tape that prevents you from reaching the bolt that keeps the cable secured to the terminal.If the end of the cable is housed in a plastic box indicating if it is positive or negative, you can open the box by squeezing the two clips on either side of it.
Be careful not to cut any wires when trying to access the bolts.

, The negative cable, also called the ground cable, should be the first you disconnect. Once you disconnect this cable, the car will no longer have a completed electrical circuit, and you may notice any dashboard, interior or engine bay lights that were on will instantly shut off. This indicates that the battery is no longer connected to the car in a manner that can power it.You will need to loosen the bolt that holds the cable in place, but you will not need to remove it.
If the bolt is seized or will not turn, try spraying some WD-40 on it. It will eat away some of the rust and oxidization and allow the bolt to turn more freely.
Do not allow the negative cable to come into contact with the positive terminal at any time.

, Because the negative cable is the one most often disconnected while working under the hood of a car, the positive one may by slightly more difficult to remove. Once the positive cable is disconnected from the battery, the battery will be completely disconnected and may be removed.Set the end of the cable aside so that it can’t fall back into place and make contact with either battery terminal.
If your battery is in the trunk, the positive cable will attach to another connector near the body of the car. Simply disconnect it from there.

, Some cars will not require the removal of the battery while replacing battery cables, but even if it is not necessary, it may make the process easier. Removing the battery can free up room to work and removes any possibility of the cables coming back into contact with their terminals and shocking you.Many cars have a bracket that holds the battery in place. Removing this bracket usually requires unscrewing two bolts.
Make sure to set the battery upright after removing it from the car.

, Start by following the negative cable from the now loose end back to where it is bolted to the engine block or body of the car. Take note of how it is routed so you can follow the same path with the new cable. Once you locate the other end, use a wrench to remove the bolt that holds the negative cable in place. Then repeat the process for the positive cable, which will be attached to the starter on the other end.Be sure the car is not hot while doing this or you may burn yourself.
It’s important you remember the way the cables are routed through the engine bay to ensure they don’t interfere with any moving parts when you replace them.

, With both the positive and negative cables removed, compare them to your replacement cables. If you purchased cables specific to your car, they should match in length and have the same terminal connectors at each end. If they don’t you will need to return them for the proper cables. If you are using universal cables that you cut to length, use the old cables as your guide.If the new cables are slightly longer than the old, that likely won’t be an issue, but shorter cables will not work.
Make sure the connecting ends at either side of the new cables match the old ones for easy installation.

, If there were plastic protective boxes on the old cable’s ends, remove them from the old cables and place them on the new ones. You will also need to ensure that there is no paint or dirt stuck on the new cable ends before you install them.The connections on either end of the cable should be bare metal to allow electricity to pass through them.
You can use a steel toothed brush to clean off the connector ends of the cables in order to ensure a good electrical connection.

, Use the same bolt you removed to disconnect the old cable to attach the new one in its place. If the bolt is rusted, you may want to use a steel wire brush to remove the rust from the bolt and ensure a proper connection. If it is too rusted, you may need to replace it.Make sure the bolt is good and tight so it can’t vibrate loose as the car runs.
Run the new positive cable back through the engine bay in the same way the old one was.

, Locate the hole the old negative cable was attached to and use the same bolt to connect the new cable. Once again, ensure the bolt is in good enough condition to hold the cable in place and allow electricity to pass through the cable.Run the new negative cable back through the engine bay in the same route the old one took.
Use a flashlight to ensure neither cable is coming into contact with any belts. Belts spin at high speeds under the engine bay and can damage battery cables.

, With both new cables in place, it’s time to place the battery back into the car. Make sure not to let the new cables come into contact with the battery terminals as you return it, as that could result in you receiving a shock. If the terminals on the battery appear to be oxidized or rusted, use a steel tooth brush to clean off the connection area before you place the battery back into the car.Bolt the bracket that holds the battery back into place to secure the battery.
Be sure you placed the battery back in the same way it was before you took it out, so the positive terminal is closer to the positive cable, and the negative terminal is closer to the negative cable.

, You may want to purchase a corrosion inhibitor that you can put on the battery terminal prior to connecting the new cable. This can help ensure the connection from the battery is strong and doesn’t become limited as corrosion builds up in your engine bay. Squeeze the inhibitor onto the terminal, then slide the new positive cable connection over it.Tighten the cable by turning the bolt you loosened to remove the old one.
Make sure the cable is connected firmly. It if jostles loose while you are driving the car will turn off.

, Remember that connecting the negative battery cable will complete the car’s circuit and reestablish power to the vehicle. Be sure all other connections are tight before completing this step. You may also want to use the corrosion inhibitor on the negative terminal. Once the negative cable is connected, the car can be started again.Be careful when touching the negative cable to the terminal and it may produce some sparks.
Tighten the cable down securely so you can be sure it won’t jiggle loose.

, Make sure you attached the cable properly by starting the car. If the car fails to turn over, one of the cables may not be properly fastened and the electricity is not reaching the starter. If the car attempts to turn over but can’t quite start, your battery may not have enough charge. If the car fails to start, recheck where the cables are connected on both ends.If the cables are installed properly and secured, remove the battery again and take it to your local auto parts store. They can test and charge the battery to ensure it’s still good.
If the cables were loose at all, tighten them and try again.
If the car starts fine, you’re all done!

Installing your own cutoff switch is relatively easy, but please heed the cautions outlined below.,
A cutoff switch is installed on or near the battery, and is used primarily to prevent battery charge depletion and for long-term storage.,
Buy a new switch.,
Disconnect the negative terminal (usually black, marked with a “—” sign).,
Disconnect the positive battery terminal (usually red, and marked with a “+” sign).

,
Carefully remove the battery clamp from the negative lead and save it should you want to remove your cutoff switch later.

,
Clean your terminals and check the fluid levels in your battery.

,
Attach the battery cutoff switch to the negative terminal, and tighten securely.

,
Reattach the positive lead to the positive battery terminal, and tighten securely.

,
Following the instructions that come with your switch, reattach the negative lead to the switch, and tighten securely.

,
Make sure the cutoff switch is turned off.,
If all is works as expected, turn off the vehicle and engage the cutoff switch.,
Do not attempt to start your vehicle with the cutoff switch engaged, or you will blow the fuse.

",How to Attach a Car Battery Cut off Switch," If you are skittish about playing with electricity, or not sure how to continue, consult a professional. They’ll be glad to help, and you’ll get a first-rate, firsthand education from a professional.;
, A fused switch will maintain current to your alarm, on-board computer, central locking system, and stereo, but still prevent your car from starting - the current generated when attempting to start the vehicle will blow the fuse and shut down all electrical connections.

, The easiest type of switch you can use is a simple terminal disconnect switch. Be sure your new switch is rated to handle the load of your vehicle’s battery. This is very important! Choosing a switch that is used, worn, or underrated can result in serious electrical problems or even fire.

, Do this first to avoid the possibility of electrical short circuiting or shock, neither of which are good for your vehicle or your body!

Keep an eye on the temperature gauge.,
Look for the check engine light.,
Identify puddles of coolant below the car.,
Check the coolant levels in your vehicle.",How to Diagnose a Cooling System Problem1," The first sign that there is an issue with the cooling system in your vehicle will often come from the temperature gauge. If your vehicle has been running consistently warmer or has recently begun having issues with overheating, there is likely an issue with the cooling system.The temperature gauge in your vehicle should have an acceptable operating range. Even if your vehicle is not overheating but has been running at the higher end of the operating range, there may be an issue.
If your vehicle is running with the temperature gauge in the red, it is overheating. Pull over and shut off the vehicle.
Issues with the cooling system can also cause the engine to run cold. In that case, the temperature gauge will remain in the blue.;
, Another early indicator of a problem with your cooling system may be the check engine light on your dashboard. Your check engine light comes on when one of the sensors in your car sends a message to the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) telling it there is an issue. If something isn’t performing properly, the check engine light is how the ECU notifies you.The error codes that prompt the check engine light to come on are the same codes that are read by an OBDII scanner.
Many vehicles have dash board lights that will notify you of low coolant levels or extreme engine temperatures as well.

, Leaks are a common issue in coolant systems. If you spot a puddle beneath your vehicle, there’s a chance that it may be the result of a coolant leak. Touch the puddle with a finger, then smear it onto a blank white sheet of paper. Oil is often brown or black, water from the air conditioner will be clear, and coolant will likely be green, pink or orange.A leak in your coolant system can cause it to fail to maintain proper temperature in the engine.

, If you suspect that your vehicle has a coolant leak, pop the hood when the engine is cool and look at your coolant reservoir. The reservoir will have lines indicating the minimum and maximum coolant capacity for your vehicle. Take note of the level the coolant reaches on the reservoir, then check again in a few days. If it has gone down, the coolant is either leaking or being burned.Make sure to check each time when the engine is the same temperature.
If you aren’t sure where your coolant reservoir is, consult your vehicle’s owner’s manual.

Allow the engine to cool.,
Put on the appropriate safety gear.,
Check the radiator cap for damage.,
Visually inspect the water pump if you can.,
Assess damage to your coolant hoses.",How to Diagnose a Cooling System Problem2," Your engine bay gets extremely hot while the engine is running, so poking around the engine bay before it has a chance to cool can result in serious burns. Allow the engine to cool for a few hours before opening the hood and looking for evidence of a coolant leak.If the hood still feels warm, the engine inside is likely very hot.
If your vehicle has been overheating, it will take even longer for it to cool enough to be safe to touch.

, Before starting any automotive project, you should put on the appropriate safety gear. Because you’ll be dealing with coolant that may be leaking, eye protection should be considered mandatory for this project. Gloves are optional, but may protect your hands from scratches or bumps as you work.Always wear eye protection when dealing with coolant leaks, as they may drip or spray under pressure.
Glasses or goggles are both acceptable forms of eye protection for this project.

, Another common point of failure in coolant systems is the radiator cap. When functioning properly, the radiator cap can release excess pressure that builds up in your coolant system, but over time it can become worn out or stuck. If the radiator cap looks rusty, is corroded or caked in grime, it may be the cause of your coolant issues. Replace your radiator cap simply by unscrewing it and screwing in a replacement.Radiator caps are inexpensive and can usually be purchased at your local auto parts store.
Never remove the radiator cap from an engine that is still warm. It could spray hot coolant and burn you.

, The water pump in your vehicle pumps the water and coolant mixture through the engine and into the radiator where air flow helps to dissipate the heat. Look for signs that your water pump is leaking or has failed if it is visible in your engine bay. The water pump is belt driven, so inspect the belt for damage that indicates that the water pump pulley has stopped moving and has been rubbing against the belt.Without a properly functioning water pump, your engine will not be able to dissipate the heat it produces as it runs, causing the vehicle to overheat.
If the belt powering the water pump is damaged, it will have to be replaced after you put in a new water pump.
If you are unsure of where to locate the water pump in your vehicle, refer to its service manual or the website for the auto maker.

, Look at the hoses traveling from the radiator and to the engine, then follow them along for as far as you can. If any of the hoses are kinked, that will cause the coolant system to fail to function properly. Cracks may also indicate a leak, but even if it isn’t leaking yet, a cracked coolant hose should be replaced before it begins to leak. Keep an eye out for damage to the hoses or signs of rubbing from the serpentine or accessory belts.If one of the belts has been rubbing on a coolant line, they will both likely need to be replaced. Make sure to install the new ones with enough clearance to avoid rubbing the belt on the hose.
Leaks in your coolant can result in puddles beneath your vehicle and overheating.

Replace radiator hoses that are leaking or are otherwise damaged.

Determine how long it’s been since the coolant has been flushed.,
Look for signs of a bad head gasket.,
Determine if your thermostat is functioning properly.,
Use an OBDII scanner to assess engine error codes.,
Look for coolant leaks.,
Use a pressure tester to locate hard to find leaks.",How to Diagnose a Cooling System Problem3," If there is no sign of a coolant leak and your vehicle is failing to properly manage temperature, it may be a result of your coolant going bad. Most auto makers recommend flushing your coolant every thirty to sixty thousand miles, so if it’s been longer than that for your vehicle, it may be the culprit. Drain and flush your coolant by opening the petcock on the bottom of the radiator and draining it into a container, then filling the coolant system with water and running the engine for a few minutes again. Repeat this process a few times to clean all of the old coolant out, then refill it with a 50/50 mixture of water and coolant.Most coolant comes pre-mixed, but you can purchase only coolant and mix it with water yourself.
Coolant can be purchased at auto parts, gas stations and large retail stores everywhere.

, If you notice coolant leaking from the engine beneath the exhaust manifold and white smoke coming from your exhaust, your vehicle’s head gasket is probably blown. A blown head gasket will result in coolant leaks, engine overheating, a severe loss of power and the previously mentioned exhaust coloring.A blown head gasket requires taking the cylinder head off of the engine to repair, so it may be best left to professionals.
If you believe the head gasket in your vehicle has blown, stop driving it immediately.

, Your vehicle’s thermostat determines the functioning temperature of your engine. If the thermostat fails in the open position, the coolant will flow continuously through the radiator and the engine will run cold. If it breaks closed, the coolant will not be able to reach the radiator, resulting in overheating. Look for signs of leaking or oxidization around your thermostat to determine if it is causing the issue.If the thermostat is rusted, it will probably not be able to function properly.
A leak coming from the area around the thermostat would cause it to fail to function.

, If the check engine light has come on in your car, plugging an OBDII scanner can help you identify exactly what’s gone wrong. Plug the OBDII scanner wire in the port beneath the dashboard on the driver’s side, turn the key to “accessories” and turn on the scanner. Depending on the scanner, it will provide you with an error code to look up or the English description of the error that occurred.Many auto parts stores will use their OBDII scanners to check the codes in your car for free.
If your scanner only provides the error codes, check the auto maker’s website to find out the description of the error.

, If your coolant system is leaking, it will not be able to properly cool the engine may even result in overheating. When visually inspecting the coolant system, be sure to look for signs of spraying or leaking coolant coming from the radiator as well as the hoses and pump. Follow any coolant you see in your engine bay up to its highest point to identify the source of the leak.You may want to spray the engine with a hose to remove all the old coolant, then start the engine again to identify where new coolant leaks out.
If the leak is in your radiator, it will either need to be repaired or replaced by a professional.

, Another tool you may opt to purchase to identify issues with your coolant system is a pressure tester. Remove the radiator cap from your engine and attach the pressure tester in its place. Turn on the heater in your vehicle without starting the engine to allow the coolant system to develop pressure. Watch the gauge on the pressure tester for sudden drops in pressure. A drop in pressure indicates a leak. Then listen in your coolant system for the sound of air escaping to locate the leak.Pressure testers can be purchased at your local auto parts store.
Your coolant system will need to be drained to properly utilize a pressure tester.

Turn the vehicle off and open the hood.,
Remove one spark plug wire from its plug.,
Remove the spark plug using a spark plug socket.,
Attach the spark plug back to the spark plug wire.,
Touch the threaded portion of the spark plug to any exposed metal in the engine.,
Remove the fuel pump relay or fuse.,
Have a friend ""crank"" the engine.,
Look for blue sparks.,
Carefully re-install the spark plug and re-connect its wire.",How to Test an Ignition Coil1," As with most types of vehicular maintenance, you'll want to begin the test with the vehicle in park and with the engine off. Open the hood to locate the ignition coil. Though its precise location may vary from vehicle to vehicle, generally, it is located near the fender or bolted to a bracket fairly close to the distributor. Note that in vehicles without a distributor, the spark plugs will be connected directly to the coil.


One sure-fire way to find the ignition coil is to locate the distributor and follow the wire that does not connect to any spark plug.
Before beginning, it's very wise to ensure you're wearing safety goggles or other eye protection and that you have access to insulated tools (especially pliers) to protect from electric shock.;
, Next, remove one of the spark plugs' wires from the plug itself. Usually, these wires run from the distributor cap to each of the spark plugs individually. To prevent injury, be very careful when working with your vehicle's electrical system - use gloves and insulated tools at all times.


If your vehicle has been running for a while, its internal components are likely to be very hot. A car that has been driven for as little as 15 minutes can heat the engine to around 200 degrees. Allow the car to sit and cool for an hour to prevent significant injury.
To save time and avoid potentially damaging your spark plug, consider using a spark plug tester instead. Instead of attaching the spark plug back to the wire, attach the spark plug tester to the wire. Ground the alligator clip. Then skip ahead and have your friend crank the engine, watching for sparks in the tester's gap.
Using a spark plug tester also means you won't expose your combustion chamber to debris.

, Once you've removed the spark plug wire, remove the spark plug itself. This is easiest with a specialized socket wrench called a spark plug socket.


From this point forward, be careful not to let anything drop into the empty hole left where your spark plug was. Leaving debris in this hole can cause damage to the engine as the vehicle runs and, since removing anything from this hole can be a big pain, it's best to take preventative care to ensure nothing of the sort happens.
Cover the cavity with a clean rag or towel to prevent debris from entering the combustion chamber.

, Now, carefully reattach the spark plug to its wire. You should be left with a spark plug that's connected to the distributor but not seated in its ""hole."" Handle the spark plug with insulated pliers to avoid the possibility of electric shock.

, Next, maneuver your spark plug (wire still attached) so that the threaded ""head"" of the plug is touching some metal part of the engine. This can be virtually any sturdy metal part of the engine block - even the engine itself.


Again, hold the spark plug carefully with insulated pliers (and, if possible, gloves). Don't risk electric shock in the next few steps by neglecting this simple safety measure.

, Before you crank the engine to test the spark plug, you must disable the fuel pump. When this is done, the engine will not start, allowing you to test the coil for spark.

Failing to remove the fuel pump relay means cylinder being tested will not fire because there is no spark plug. It will, however, still be flooded with fuel, which may cause serious damage.
Check your manual to locate the fuel pump relay.

, Get a friend or assistant to turn the key in the vehicle's ignition. This will provide power to the car's electrical system and, thus, to the spark plug you're holding (assuming your ignition coil is working), If your ignition coil is working properly, when your friend cranks the engine, you should see a bright blue spark jump across the spark plug gap. This spark will be clearly visible in the daylight. If you don't see a blue spark, your ignition coil is probably malfunctioning and needs replacement.



Orange sparks are a bad sign. These mean that the ignition coil is supplying insufficient electricity to the spark plug (this can be for any number of reasons, including cracked coil casings, ""weak"" current, faulty connections, etc.).
The final possibility you may observe is that no spark occurs. This is usually a sign that either the ignition coil is completely ""dead,"" that one or more electrical connections are faulty, or that you've done something wrong in your test.

, When you've concluded your test, ensure the vehicle is turned off before essentially repeating the preparatory steps above in reverse order. Disconnect the spark plug from its wire, re-insert it into its hole, and re-connect the wire.


Congratulations! You've completed your ignition coil test!

Remove the ignition coil from the vehicle.,
Find the resistance specifications for your ignition coil.,
Position the leads of the ohmmeter on the poles of the primary coil.,
Position the leads of the ohmmeter on the poles of the secondary coil.,
Determine whether the readings you recorded fall within your vehicle's specifications.",How to Test an Ignition Coil2," The test above isn't the only way to determine whether the ignition coil in your vehicle is functioning as it should. If you have access to a piece of electrical equipment called an ohmmeter, which measures electrical resistance, you can measure the effectiveness of your ignition coil in a definitive, quantifiable way, rather than in the somewhat subjective way described above. However, to begin this test, you'll need to remove the vehicle's ignition coil so that you can easily access its electrical terminals.


Refer to your service manual for precise instructions on removing your ignition coil. Usually, you'll need to disconnect it from the distributor wire, then unscrew it from its mounting with a wrench. Ensure your vehicle is turned off and has had a chance to cool before beginning this process.

, Every vehicle's ignition coil has its own unique specifications in terms of the electrical resistance within the coil. If your coil's actual resistance levels fall outside of these specifications, you'll know that your coil is damaged. Usually, you'll be able to find the resistance specifications unique to your vehicle by consulting your service manual. However, if you can't find it here, you may find success by contacting your dealership or by searching online vehicular resources.


Generally speaking, most automotive coils will have a resistance reading of about .7 - 1.7 ohms for the primary winding and 7,500 - 10,500 ohms for the secondary winding., The distributor will have three electrical contacts - two on either side and one in the middle. These may be either external (jutting out) or internal (sunken in) - it makes no difference. Turn on your ohmmeter and touch one lead to each of the outer electrical contacts. Record the resistance reading - this is the resistance of the coil's primary winding.


Note that some newer models of ignition coil have contact configurations that differ from this traditional arrangement. Consult your vehicle's manual for information if you are unsure which contacts correspond to the primary winding.

, Next, keep one lead on one of the outer contacts and touch the other to the central, inner contact of the ignition coil (where the main wire to the distributor connects). Record the resistance reading - this is the resistance of the coil's secondary winding.

, Ignition coils are delicate components of a vehicle's electrical system. If either the primary or secondary windings are even a little outside of your vehicle's specifications, you'll want to replace your ignition coil, as your current one is likely damaged or malfunctioning.

Check your temperature gauge in the car.,
Turn off your car and allow it to cool before opening the hood.,
Unfasten the radiator drain cock located near the bottom of the radiator and allow some of the coolant to drain out into a container with a lid until the level is below the upper radiator hose.,
Locate your thermostat.,
Fill a pan with water and place the thermostat into the water until it's completely submerged.,
Start heating the water and place a cooking thermometer into the water.",How to Tell if Your Car's Thermostat Is Stuck Closed1," A stuck thermostat might be to blame if your gauge marker nears the red danger zone within five to 15 minutes.;
, Unhook your coolant reservoir if you can undo it and pour the antifreeze into a container. Locate your radiator and remove the cap.

,


You might not need to drain the radiator, depending on the amount your reservoir holds. The amount drained is roughly 1 to 2 qt. (4 to 8 cups). You can reuse this coolant if it is brand new. Otherwise, replace it with new coolant.

, The thermostat housing is usually under the upper radiator hose. Unbolt the housing and remove the thermostat, using a screwdriver and pliers. Take the thermostat inside. There will generally be a number somewhere on the body, giving it's opening temperature usually between 160 to 190°F or 70 to 90°C. Otherwise you will need to check the Workshop Manual for the car.

, Ensure that the part does not touch the bottom of the pan.

, Check the temperature frequently while monitoring the thermostat.


The thermostat should remain closed until it just about reaches the thermostat-opening temperature designated on the body (or in the Workshop Manual). At this temperature, you should see the thermostat begin to open.
The part should be completely open when the water reaches approximately 10 degrees above the reading on the thermostat. If the thermostat is still closed at this point, it needs to replaced.

"
"
Look to see if your temperature gauge is nearing the danger point.,
Open the hood of your car as long as it is not too hot and locate the radiator hoses.,
Touch the top radiator hose carefully.",How to Tell if Your Car's Thermostat Is Stuck Closed2," This tends to happen quickly, so turn off your car as soon as you notice it.

, If the hood is too hot to touch, wait at least 10 minutes before opening it.

, The hose can be very hot, so only touch it for a few seconds with your fingertips. Repeat for the bottom radiator hose.


Both radiator hoses should be very warm to the touch. If one hose is very hot and the other one feels cool or even cold to the touch, the thermostat is likely stuck in the closed position.

"
"
Start your car and let it sit idling for a while.,
Open the hood, with the engine still running.,
Squeeze the hose near the middle, as if you were trying to squeeze it shut.

,
Release it, and you should feel a surge as the water comes through.",How to Tell if Your Car's Thermostat Is Stuck Closed3," Or, take it for a short drive to warm up the fluid in the radiator.

, Put on an oven mitt or a heat-resistant glove. Find the top radiator hose (the one that connects to the thermostat housing).

,, If it is too firm to squeeze the thermostat is stuck closed."

Check for symptoms.,
Inspect the wires.,
Run the engine.,
Use a jumper wire to ground a well-insulated screwdriver.,
Use a spray bottle with water to spray down the wires.,
Perform a spark plug wire resistance test.,
Inspect the spring clips that hold the wires in the distributor cap.,
Determine if your spark plug wires are routed properly.",How to Test Spark Plug Wires," Defective spark plug wire leave tell-tale signs of their deterioration, including:









An erratic idle
Engine misfire
Radio interference
Decreased fuel mileage
Failed emissions tests due to elevated hydrocarbon emissions or a fault code indicating cylinder misfire.
Check engine light;
, Use a flashlight or an area with good lighting to perform a visual inspection of the spark plug wires.









Look for physical damage to the wires or boots such as cuts and scorch marks.
Check the spark plug wire, and examine the insulation around the wire.
Look for damage due to high heat from the engine compartment (scorch marks).
Check for corrosion between the boot and the spark plug and coil.

, Look for electrical arcs or listen for a snapping noise that may indicate a high-voltage electrical leak.








, Drag the screwdriver down the length of each spark plug wire, around the coil, and the boots. If you see an arc from a wire to the screwdriver, you have defective wire.








, You will want to especially spray near the boots that attach to the spark plugs to see if any arcing occurs, and if mist is present. If arcing is found at the boot near the spark plug, turn off the engine. Then remove the boot from the plug and check inside the boot for carbon tracking. If carbon tracking is present, the spark plug will also need to be replaced.








, Locate the spark plug's resistance rating in the vehicle's factory service manual. You can also search online for the resistance of after-market wires.









Use an ohm meter to determine if the resistance of the wire is in compliance with the recommendations. Place the probes on either end of the wire lead, making sure they touch the metal contacts, and verify that they're within the range called for in the manual.

, Damaged clips may allow the wires to slip and not hold their proper position.

, Look in the vehicle's manual to help you with this task. Cross coupling can create an energy drain.

Ensure the engine is warm and the choke butterfly standing upright.,

Locate the throttle arm on the left side of the carburetor.,

Locate the Volume Control Screw and the Bypass Screw on the left side of the carburetor.,
Go back to the Volume Screw and adjust it (usually out -- counter-clockwise) slowly to obtain the fastest idle .,
Use the Bypass screw again to reset the idle speed to 850 - 900rpm.",How to Set the 34Pict/3 Carburetor on an Aircooled Volkswagen (Vw) Beetle," Ensure the air cleaner is ON when adjusting the carburetor.
, It is controlled by the accelerator cable that runs to the accelerator pedal in the cabin.

On the top of the throttle arm, facing to the rear of the car, is a screw called the Fast Idle Adjuster.

This works with the choke to give a smooth idle on a cold engine.
As the choke warms in concert with the warming engine, the butterfly valve in the throat of the carburetor opens and the Fast Idle Adjuster moves down the stepped cam, reducing the engine idle speed.


Make sure that the choke is fully open and the Fast Idle Adjuster screw is resting on the very bottom of the stepped cam.

Unscrew the Fast Idle Adjuster screw until it is clear of the stepped cam.
Screw it in until it just touches the very bottom of the stepped cam -- NOT on any of the steps themselves.
Now screw it in another 1/4 turn. This sets the throttle butterfly open the required 0.004 inch (0.0 cm).



, Turn the Bypass Screw (the larger one) out a couple of turns, to get things started.

The Volume Control Screw is the smaller of the two adjusting screws.

Screw it in GENTLY until it bottoms.
Now unscrew it exactly 2-1/2 turns. This is the starting setting.
Start the engine and use the Bypass Screw to set the idle at 850 rpm.



,

It should not be much outside the range of 2-3 turns 1/2 turn in/out from the basic 2-1/2 turn out setting.

If not the night before at least several hours prior to starting work.;
, This idea came from a video done by a teenage girl who was replacing gaskets on her Honda’s valve cover. Use a shop rag or towel to clean dirt and grunge off of valve cover around the plugs. Remove the plastic Vtech wire cover. There are two plastic slotted screws on the cover that require a 1/4 turn to release. Clean more after the plastic cover has been removed.

, The things that will be taken off in the next few steps are the wire connector, the black 10mm nut and the plug igniter. I did each plug one at at time. Although there is no chance of getting ignition wires mixed up on the Civic there is still a chance that something might fall into the open plug area. So doing each plug completely helps avoid problems.

, The screwdriver tip is pointing at a tab on the top right side of the connector. You can push the tab in with the screwdriver and at the same time push the connector up with your thumb (or another screwdriver if you like) and the connector will move up. No need to force it as the connector will move when the tab is pushed in.

, Use your 10mm socket to remove the black nut. Once you have the first connector off you can readily see how it works and the other three will be much easier to remove. Be sure to clean the grunge that is under the connector before removing the plug igniter.

, For some reason the rubber insert in both of my 5/8” sockets stuck to the plug body. This wasn’t a problem getting the old plug out. But when the new plug went in the rubber insert stuck to the new plug. Not good. Put the new plug into the plug igniter lowered the plug into the hole and seated the plug with almost one full turn – just enough for a few threads to catch. Then finish tightening the new plug with the socket. As you can guess the top of the igniter hits the threaded post and this prevents further rotation of the plug. Another method would be to use a length of rigid tubing that fits over the body of the plug, lower the plug into the hole, turn a few times and then pull the tubing off. So take an old plug to Lowe's or Home Depot and find some tubing in the plumbing department so you will have it for the next time you change plugs.

, Be careful not to get any on the electrodes. You must clean off the excess so that the compound is only in the threads. You want a nice smooth coating so none of the compound drops into the cylinder. By the way, this compound also comes in a stick that you simply rub onto the threads. Even though it might be cleaner you still need to coat only the threads. No additional goop allowed.

, In this photo you can see the new plug in the igniter. It will be used to seat the plug. Just below the tip of the plug is the rubber ring from the inside of my plug socket. Just be aware that this type of problem presents itself only when the car can not be driven so be sure to have all your supplies on hand or another car to use for running errands. If you have to run out in the middle of the job be sure to cover any open holes with a clean shop rag or clean towel.

, Back off if you feel the plug is not going in straight or you detect any miss threading and start again. The plug should thread in easily. After the plug is hand tight put either your torque wrench or socket handle onto the extension and (again) tighten slowly until the plug stops or you reach the recommended torque. If using your socket wrench do not over tighten. After the plug stops and you meet resistance to turning tighten no more than 1/4 of a turn.

, When the igniter touches the top of the plug the wire connector will slip on very easily and click into place. Line up the hole for the threaded post and push the igniter onto the plug. Hand tighten the black 10mm nut and then finish tightening with the 10mm socket wrench. Do not over tighten.

, Clear the engine compartment of everything that does not belong in there and start the car."

, You’re looking for a black cover at the back of the engine held down by four bolt; it should have three lines going through it from left to right.

















, You’re going to want to pop open the wire cover (a big black plastic case with wires going to it behind the ignition coils) with a flat head screwdriver. On you can see the wires you should inspect them for any breaks or cuts.









If you want to completely open the wire case, you may need to remove a bracket holding a power steering line in-place.







, All you need to do is squeeze the locking lever on the connection and wiggle it until it comes off. You’ll need to do third about four times.










, Two of the bolts are just regular ones, and the other two are special ones to be able to secure the cover and the coil. Once the bolts are removed just pull the coils out and put aside.

















, You’ll notice that the coil is rather long, that’s because the top of the coil is not at the combustion chamber. So to remove the spark plug, you'll need your 5/8 inch spark plug socket, the ratchet that fits the socket size (probably a 3/8 inch drive ratchet) and your long extension. Put it in the hole and then turn counterclockwise until you can take the plug out.










, If you decide you can keep it, you should clean it up a bit with your steel wool, and check the clearance specification of where the spark is produced. (This can be found either in the owner’s manual or under the hood itself, and if not there then check the internet.)










, If not, bend it into place (the spec may vary by vehicle).

, Basically all you need to do is reverse the steps but you need to torque things dow; the spark plug should be torqued to about 13 foot-pounds. Everything else should just be hand tightened. Then you're done! You've now made your car run even better than before (hopefully).

Prop open the hood of your vehicle.,
Locate the spark plug wires.,
Understand why spark plug wires wear out.,
Determine whether or not you need to replace the wires.,
Determine how many wires you need.,
Make sure to buy the right wire length.",How to Replace Spark Plug Wires1," The hood latch is typically located to the lower left-hand side of the driver's dashboard. Some cars feature hydraulic hoods that stay propped open automatically. Either way, it's important to make sure that your hood will not fall onto you while you're rooting around in the engine.;
, The wires are typically located next to the valve covers in the cylinder head. On one end, each wire will be attached to a spark plug and on the other end, to a distributor or ignition coils., Due to the high voltage constantly sent through the spark plug wires, they have the tendency to increase in resistance over time. Eventually, this creates too much resistance for any electricity to flow. With the increase in resistance in the wires, there is a decrease in the amount of electricity arriving through the spark plugs — which results in the incomplete combustion of gases inside the cylinder. If there is damage to the protective shield encasing the spark plug wires, then you need to replace the spark plug wires., Age alone does not necessarily indicate that you need new spark plug wires. Look for damage to the wires, and listen for engine malfunction. If you see sparks jumping from the wire to the engine, it is a sign that you need to replace the wires.


Be aware of some of the obvious engine symptoms: rough, bumpy idling, and a deep ""coughing"" sound. The engine symptoms can also be caused by faulty spark plugs and other, deeper issues, so you first must prove that your wires have gone bad and need to be replaced.You may need to replace the wires if you see sparks jump to the ground at night with the hood up and engine running. Depending on the conductivity of your wires, there might be sparks leaping from the whole front of the car, or just from one spot.
Look for obvious flaws in the wires. You may encounter frays, cracks, and even burnt spots. Any or all of these damages can indicate that you need to replace the wires.

, Now that you have determined the number and type of spark plug wires, you can buy them at any local auto parts store. The clerk should be happy to help confirm that you are getting the correct type and amount of wires.

, You must buy an entire set, even if you only need to replace one wire. Thus, if you have a six-cylinder engine, you must purchase all six wires, all of which will vary in length. You must be aware of the length of the wire you are replacing compared to the old wires on your engine. Try to stay as close as possible to the old wire length.


Different makers have different lengths, and replacement wires are often sold longer than the originals. This allows them to sell more assemblies of wires to fit more applications, so you may have slight differences. Check the length before you start, and it'll be okay.
Quality is important. Stay away from most of the ""make your own length"" kits unless they are high quality and you are very comfortable installing your own boots.
Oftentimes, the manufactures do not allow repairs on their wires. Don't start cutting the wires to a certain length unless you know for certain that new ends can be safely put on the wires you cut. Otherwise, you may regret it!
Some spark plug wires can be purchased individually from some auto parts stores fully assembled.

Position the parts.,
Melt the Babbitt metal.,
Heat the bearing shell and the shaft.,
Skim clean the molten Babbitt metal.,
Pour the bearing.,
Finish the bearing.",How to Pour Babbitt Bearings," Babbitt bearings are solid and must be melted off with an oxy-acetylene torch, available at hardware and building supply stores. Open the bearing case and melt off the old bearing, making sure you melt the retaining grooves and holes, as well. Collect the melted Babbitt in a cast iron lead melting pot, available at welding supply outlets. Scrape remaining Babbitt from the bearing case, grooves and holes and add them to the pot.
, You should not reuse the Babbitt that has been melted off due to impurities from years of use. Determine which alloy of Babbitt that you need. You can determine which alloy is needed with the surface speed of the shaft and the load the bearing is going to be caring. Tin and Lead based Babbitts have different compositions for different loads and uses. The formula in the following reference will help you to find which Babbitt alloy is right for your bearing.Babbitt metal is usually available at sawmill supply companies, chipper companies or some hardware stores. It is also available to be ordered directly from manufactures like Kapp Alloy., Bearing surfaces are then typically cleaned with a solvent to remove any oil or other contaminant residues. On very well-worn and old surfaces, this can be the most difficult part of the bearing refurbishment. Often, the lubricants and contaminants have worked well into the steel and old bearing Babbitt. You may find that you think the surface is clean, but on heating, more contaminants and oil surface from the steel. These contaminants can be drawn out by alternating: a. heat while scrubbing with a stainless steel brush, and b. solvent treatments. Removing these contaminants is critical to a uniform Babbitt bond. Make sure that the shaft to be supported by the bearing is smooth and clean., To prevent the shaft from sticking to the bearing, coat the shaft with smoke from a low flame kerosene lamp or a candle., Place the bearing shell in the vertical position. Align the shaft in the exact middle of the bearing shell. Plug or dam the holes in the bearing, except for the fill hole. Clay, wood, sheet metal and fireproof pasteboard can all be used to plug the holes., Use the cast iron lead melting pot. Heat the Babbitt metal to the desired pouring temperature depending on the Babbitt alloy.An electric lead pot designed to cast bullets is the preferred method because the pot has a temperature control. The melters typically are available at armory supply shops and specialty forging shops. These outlets also should be able to provide a bullet caster's thermometer, which is used to ensure that the Babbitt metal is at the desired temperature., This will minimize the thermal shock when pouring and yield a properly formed and consistent bearing. Heat the bearing shell and shaft to about 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) so that moisture will evaporate quickly, but not sputter., When the Babbitt metal has reached the proper temperature, stir the fluid. Skim off any dross (impurities) that have floated to the top of the molten metal., Pour the molten Babbitt metal into the bearing shell. If the ladle is not big enough to fill with 1 pour, work quickly to get the second pour in so that no boundary forms between the 2 pours., Allow the bearing to fully cool. Use a drill to drill out the oil holes. Clean any excess material from the drilling. Use a diamond shaped chisel to chisel an oil groove from the oil holes to about 0.25 inches (6.35 mm) from the end of the bearing. The oiling groove must be cut on the inside surface of the bearing, so the bearing must be driven off of the shaft for the chiseling and then replaced. Clean any excess material left from the chiseling."

Make sure that the car is turned off.,
Keep an inventory.,
Be methodical.,
Unplug the wires.",How to Replace Spark Plug Wires2," Never try to replace plug wires on a running motor. Likewise, do not try to replace plug wires on a motor that's too hot to touch.

, Once located, take note of the length and location of each wire. You will need to put each new wire back where you pulled its corresponding worn wire – and it will be much easier if you write down what you've done. If you connect the wires in the wrong order, your engine will misfire and run poorly. Try marking each wire with tape and a number (corresponding to a spark plug location) so that you don't lose track., Replace the wires one at a time, and in a specific order or direction. This may help you remember which wire goes where, and it will reduce the risk of putting the firing order out of sync with the engine. Take your time. Start with one wire, and completely finish replacing it before moving on to the next one.


The wire is connected at both ends. You must unplug each side before installing the new wire.
The spark plug must fire when the piston is nearly at its highest point in the cylinder. Thus, it is imperative that you do not get this sequence out of order. Try starting at one end of your engine, and working across.

, Use a spark plug wire removal tool to unplug and remove the wires. Use caution when you pull the wire from the plug. The newer engines have rubber boots that fit tightly over the plug, keeping it dry and clean. Remove the wire by pulling on the boot. If you pull on the wire instead of the boot, you may destroy the wire, and some of it will be left on the plug.Some of the wires can be very tightly stuck to the spark plug. Grasp the rubber boot firmly. If it doesn't pop off immediately, try twisting it back and forth while you pull it free.
Inspect the boot for signs of carbon tracking. This will appear as a black line running from top to bottom inside the boot. If you notice this line, the spark plug must be removed for inspection.

"
"
Work backward.,
Close and latch the hood.,
Listen to your vehicle.,
Take the car for a test drive.,
Finished.

",How to Replace Spark Plug Wires3," Connect the new wires in the same order as you removed the old wires. Before installing the boot on to the spark plug, add a small amount of dielectric grease to the spark plug boot. The boot will be fully seated onto the plug when a small click is felt. Plug wires run from the distributor or coil to the plug, and must be replaced exactly as factory run. Running from a coil to the wrong plug will prevent the engine from running, which could lead to damage. Keep the wires away from exhaust components that might damage them, and keep each wire from crossing over another wire.Spark plug wires usually rest in wire looms or standoffs. A wire resting on the engine or a wire crossing another can short or leak or break down due to heat. Thus, make sure to rout the replacements properly through the loom, well away from resting on any metal.If replacing wires with a high performance coil and kit, be aware existing looms may not fit. In this case, you can buy larger diameter standoffs to attach or widen the holes in the looms.

, Try to lift up your hood after you've closed it, and make sure that it isn't loose. You should not be able to pop the hood without using the switch inside your vehicle cab.

, After you have carefully installed the wires in their correct places, start the engine. It should run and idle smoothly. You may notice new power and efficiency, especially if your old wires were heavily worn down. If your engine does not run, runs very roughly, or backfires after replacement, then check for improperly run wires, wires run to the wrong cylinder, wires that are grounded along their length, wires that are not properly seated in the boot, or boots that are not properly seated to make contact with the coil or plug.


Never touch a wire on a running engine, or you might receive a painful shock. There are tens of thousands of volts generated in the ignition system, and an improperly seated wire is much more likely to shock you. It has less of a ground at the plug end, making you a more viable path.
If you notice bad idle backfire or other performance problems, you have likely put a wire in the wrong place. Consider hiring a local mechanic to diagnose and fix the problem.

, While on the test drive, try to put the engine under a load by driving up a hill or slowing down in a higher gear, then accelerate with downshifting to put the ignition system under a load. Ignition systems have a better chance of failing under a load.

If you purchased new spark plugs, their colors should be fairly similar.A good spark plug will not need to be replaced.
If you have been having a misfire in the cylinder with a good spark plug, there may be an issue with the plug wire. Try replacing it to see if that solves the problem.;
, Carbon fouling often occurs when your vehicle’s engine is running too rich. Running too rich means there is too much fuel in the air/fuel mixture when it is ignited by the spark plug. Look for black soot on the sparking surface of the plug.A black, dry soot may develop on the plug when the engine is running too rich.
You may be able to clean the soot off of the plug and avoid having to replace it. Wipe it down with a rag or spray it with Brake Cleaner to clean it.
You will need to bring your vehicle to a mechanic to diagnose why it is running rich.

, If there is oil leaking in your engine down past worn piston rings or through the valves on your cylinder head, the spark plug may be oil-fouled. Look for wet motor oil on the plug itself.Oil fouled plugs will be wet, whereas carbon fouled plugs will be dry.
You will need to address the oil leak to prevent fouling more spark plugs.
An oil leak into the engine can cause significant issues. Bring your vehicle to a mechanic for diagnosis and repair.

, If you have been having overheating issues with your engine, you may burn out a spark plug. Look for blistering on the insulator tip of the spark plug or signs of heat damage such as melted plastic or burned metal.A heat damaged spark plug will have to be replaced.
Overheating issues may be caused by worn out or insufficient levels of coolant.
Add coolant if your vehicle is low, otherwise you may need to drain and flush your radiator.

, A severely worn spark plug is simply a plug that has been in use for too long. Older vehicles that have never had their spark plugs replaced may experience spark plug failure without fouling them in the ways listed above.Severe wear can cause a spark plug to come apart as you remove it. You may also see signs of eroded connections or cracking plastic.
Severely worn plugs must be replaced.

, Before working on a vehicle’s electrical system, it is important to disconnect the battery. Use the appropriate hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut holding the ground cable on the negative terminal of the battery, then slide the cable off of the terminal and tuck it to the side.You will not need to disconnect the positive wire.

, Spark plug wires come from an ignition source such ignition coil packs or a distributor and connect to the spark plugs via holes in the cylinder head of the engine. Grip the plug wire from the base at the spark plug, and pull back on the wire to disconnect it.Plug wires will often come off with a “pop” and may require a bit of force.
Do not pull on the wire itself, as it may tear the plug wire and leave the base connected to the spark plug.

, Make sure the area around the spark plug holes is clean of debris, dirt or oil before removing the spark plugs. The spark plugs are screwed directly into the cylinder chamber, so anything that falls into the holes will be falling directly into the engine itself.Debris falling into the holes can cause serious damage to the engine the next time you start it.
If anything does fall into the holes, use a shop vacuum or canned air to get it out before re-installing a spark plug.

, Spark plug sockets resemble ordinary sockets but have a rubber cup inside them that grips the spark plug as you unscrew it. A regular socket of the right size will simply unscrew the plug but leave it inside the hole.Spark plugs usually come in only one size and spark plug sockets tend to fit plugs in most applications.

, Unscrew the spark plug by turning the wrench in a counter-clockwise motion until it has completely unthreaded. Then slide the spark plug socket up out of the hole gently with the spark plug still inside.If the spark plug is still warm, you may want to leave it in the socket as you examine it.

, Speak to the clerk at your local auto parts store to get help choosing the right spark plug for your engine. Spark plugs burn at varying degrees of intensity and it’s important to choose one designed for use in your vehicle.You can also find out what spark plug is right for your vehicle by referring to the service manual for its specific year, make and model.
Make sure to disconnect the battery prior to moving on.

, Before installing the new spark plug, use compressed air from a can or air compressor to clean out any dirt or debris that may be in the hole you are inserting the plug into. This will prevent any of it from falling into the engine and damaging it.Be extremely careful not to drop any debris or small tools into the hole for the spark plug.
A shop vacuum may be a better choice if debris has already fallen into the hole.

, The gap on the spark plug’s sparking surface dictates the length of the spark that is used to ignite the air and fuel within the engine. Use a spark plug gapping tool to create the correct gap in the spark plugs before installing them.Most spark plug gapping tools are shaped in a circle. Insert the edge of the circle into the gap between the plug and its sparking surface, then turn it until it reaches the gap for your vehicle.
Find the appropriate gap size for your engine by referring to your vehicle’s service manual.

, Insert the spark plug into the rubber boot in the spark plug socket, then attach the socket to a socket extension that’s at least a few inches long. This will allow you to screw the plug in like you might screw in a screw with a screw driver.Make sure the extension is long enough for you to be able to screw the plug into place with it.
Most spark plug tools use a 3/8 inch drive, so use an extension for the same size ratchet.

, Rotate the plug and extension clockwise without placing too much downward pressure on it. If you force the plug to screw in, you may cross the threads in the engine block, which will result in expensive repairs.Turn the extension clockwise until the plug threads into place inside the engine.
If it suddenly becomes hard and then easy again to screw in the spark plug, remove it and start over to avoid cross threading it.

, Once the plug is hand tight inside the engine, connect a ratchet to the extension and tighten the plug slightly to ensure it will not vibrate out of place. You will not need to put too much pressure on the spark plug to ensure it’s tight.Do not overtighten the plug as it may break the spark plug or make it very difficult to remove.
If you break a spark plug, you will need a professional to remove it.

, Take the plug wire you disconnected from the previous spark plug and press it firmly onto the back end of the now secured spark plug. The plug wire should pop into place on the spark plug when you know it is firmly connected.You may choose to apply a small amount of electrical grease to the spark plug or wire to ensure a strong connection.
Reconnect the battery once you’re done.

Each vehicle's measurement will be different, though most are generally somewhere between 0.028-.06 inch. You can either look in your owner's manual or go to the auto parts store and have them look it up for you.












Modified engines require smaller gap settings to account for the amount of power you're putting through the engine. General rule of thumb: the more power, the smaller the gap.












;
, There are several varieties of tools used to measure the gaps of spark plugs, some of which are more appropriate for more modern plugs, which sometimes feature delicate precious metals. Most measuring tools will also feature a flat edge typically used for bending the bottom electrode on the spark plug to adjust the gap slightly.









A coin-style gap measure is usually the cheapest option, and works by running the edge of the ""coin"" through the gap until you reach a point where it stops. The edge is marked like a ruler, designating the thickness of the edge at that point. This is a good tool for older plugs you want to check the efficacy of, but can also inadvertently widen the gaps as you use it.













A wire coin gap works essentially the same way as the regular coin-style gap, but features different wire measures of varying lengths on the edge around the coin.













A blade-style feeler gauge is an effective and versatile tool. Built like a pocket-knife, this gauge features different blades of varying widths, some with wire on the end and some without, placed in the gap to check the spacing of the electrodes. You can also use multiple blades to measure larger gaps. These are effective to use while adjusting.














, If you've just pulled it out of the box, it should be in pretty good shape, but if you're checking a plug that you've been using in your car it's a good idea to clean it off a little with a clean cloth. Spark plugs can build up some whitish soot on the contact points, so you'll want to make sure they're somewhat clean to get the most accurate reading.








You can use a little bit of quick-drying (90%) alcohol on the contact points to clean them off if they're especially dirty. Lots of build-up or any blackening on the contact points might be a sign of a plug that's outlasted its prime, however. If they're especially dirty, you might consider buying new ones.














, Place the appropriate blade or wire on your gap tool between the electrode tips of the plug, or pass the coin through the electrodes to determine the measurement.








, If the tool passes through the gap without touching the electrodes at the appropriate measure, your gap is too wide. If you can't fit it between the electrodes, the gap is too small and needs to be widened some. If it fits closely to the specified measurement, you're safe to install the spark plug.








Most spark plugs and iridium plugs manufactured today don't need to be gapped prior to installing them. If you've got a custom modified engine, though, you might be interested in checking or installing plugs at a different spacing. Adjust them accordingly.














, When you hold the spark plug with the electrodes facing the floor, you'll want to bend the bottom one very gently either in toward the other electrode if you want to narrow the gap, or out, if you want to increase the gap slightly.









Never bend more than a few (.02) fractions of an inch. It won't take much pressure, so be very careful. Spark plugs can be quite delicate, and any fracturing can cause misfires.













If you're having trouble using the tool to adjust the gap, consider bending it in using a flat surface like a table to apply some very gentle pressure on the electrode to adjust it.














, Be very careful not to contact the electrode in the center of the plug and damage the core. If it breaks or shorts you'll need to toss it and buy a new one.








, Snapping off the electrode will waste your efforts, and it doesn't take much to do so. Use only a small amount of pressure to bend the electrode and only bend it a little bit.

Let your car sit overnight, parked in a garage with a clean concrete floor.,
Examine the cardboard the next morning.,
Check the water pump pulley.,
Listen to your car.,
Look for leaks around the water pump.,
Notice if your temperature warning light comes on.,
Observe if your low coolant light is glowing.",How to Tell if a Car's Water Pump Needs Replacement," If it's not possible to park it inside on a clean concrete surface, place a piece of light-colored cardboard underneath your car directly under the motor. Be mindful that water pumps are more likely to leak while the vehicle engine is running, so this is a poor reference for finding a leak.;
, If it appears to be wet from coolant, you have a leak somewhere, possibly in your water pump, but other sources of leaking coolant could be radiator hoses, heater hoses, freeze plugs, gaskets, or the radiator itself. To narrow the search down, try to place the cardboard directly underneath the water pump itself. If you notice green liquid on the cardboard, it's antifreeze. This means you have a coolant leak somewhere.

, Find the round part at the front of your water pump that the belt is around. Attempt to rock the pulley back and forth. If it seems to be loose, it may be time to replace it, because the bearing is going bad.

, Start your car's engine with the hood up. If you hear a low-pitched grinding noise, it may indicate that your water pump bearing is going bad. You can often hear it plainly if it's gone bad. You also have similar bearings in your AC compressor, power steering pump, and alternator, so you need to be able to focus on the exact source of the sound, often difficult on a running engine.

, If you see drops of water or a small stream, you have a leak. Many water pumps have a weep hole in front of the seal that will allow water to leak out if the seal is bad.

, If your car is not circulating enough coolant due to a leaky or malfunctioning water pump, your engine temperature is going to increase, triggering the warning light.

, This can be an indicator that your coolant reservoir is leaking or that you have a bad water pump. One other alternative is that there is a leak in the cooling system.

Fill the engine with new oil, replace the oil filter and fill the cooling system with new factory specified coolant.",How to Install a Head Gasket," It will include step by step procedures with images that explain how to replace your head gasket(s). It will also list any special tools that you may need.;
, Remove the parts that are connected to the cylinder head. Refer to your car's service manual for specifics, but in most cases this involves removing the exhaust manifold, the intake manifold, valve cover and drive belts. On many engines, you will need to remove the timing belt or timing chain. Be sure to study the timing belt/chain alignment procedures and be sure you clearly see the alignment marks before you disassemble the timing components.


Catalog each part as it is removed. Either take pictures or write down each part to help you remember where everything goes once you're done.

The cylinder head is held on by several bolts and some engines have a sequence for the bolts' removal. Some head bolts cannot be reused and must be replaced. Follow the manual and manufacture requirements.
Once all head bolts are out then lift the cylinder head off of the engine block. Look at the head surface and the block along with the gasket for the failure areas.
The gasket will be a thin piece of sealing material that can be seen once you remove the head. The gasket can be made out of metal, deformable material, or a combination of both. The failure can be a break in the gasket.

, If the pressure test reveals no cracks, have the machine shop resurface the head(s). Don't ever re-install a cylinder head that has not been professionally re-surfaced and examined for cracks.


Check the service manual for the head bolt specifications to see if the bolts need to be replaced whenever the head gasket is replaced. Some bolts are what is called torque to yield type and would need to be replaced
The cams on overhead cam motors will need the cams removed to service the cylinder heads. Talk to the machine shop that is working on your heads about what needs to be removed before having them work on them.

, Do not scratch or remove any metal from either, as this may prevent the head gasket from sealing. Prevent any dirt or debris from getting into the cylinders or on pistons during the cleaning process. Inspect the piston tops and cylinder walls for any damage from the overheating or the head gasket problem. Make sure all surfaces are clean and dry.

,, Use gasket sealant when specified by the manufacturer, and only use the directed amount in the particular places. Deviating from the manufacturer's recommendations can cause damage to the internal parts of the engine. Most head gaskets will be marked ""top"" and ""up"" for proper installation.

,, Check the service manual for the head bolt torque sequence and the amount of torque that needs to be applied for each step. Some head bolts require 3 steps plus specified degree rotation as the final step.


Overhead cam heads may need the cams to be in a set position before the head is installed, or installed after the head is installed to keep the valves from contacting the pistons and bending them.

,, Check to see if the engine is an interference type of engine. If so, there is a very specific method to rotate and set up the camshaft to crankshaft timing so you don't damage or bend the valves! If equipped, install the distributor so it is properly timed with the number one cylinder. If applicable, adjust the valve clearance to proper specification.

, When you start the engine, be sure to let the engine idle with the heater on full blast. This is so the cooling system has a chance to bleed out any air bubbles. Some engines require a specific cooling system bleeding procedure, be sure to check for that.


Make sure the engine does not overheat during the purging process, or head gasket or head damage could occur again. Once all air is out of the cooling system and engine temperature is stable and in the normal range, check for any leaking oil or coolant.

Start the car to verify that the oil pressure is stable.",How to Install a Camshaft," Engine assemblies vary drastically from make to make and model to model, so it's impossible to offer a generalized guide for installing every camshaft. For this reason, it's important to invest in a Haynes guide, or another official user's manual with rebuild schematics specific to your make and model.


It's possible to seriously damage your engine and wreck the timing if you don't use a detailed manual for this job. Read on only for a general description of the steps of the process.;
, To access the crankshaft compartment, you may have to pull the entire engine, depending on the type of engine and the make of the vehicle. Overhead Camshaft (OHC) engines are much easier to access than Overhead Valve (OHV) type engines, with the camshaft centered in an engine block.


Most American-made V8 and V6 engines use in-block camshafts, which means you may have to pull the engine out to do the swap.Many engines using overhead camshaft configuration actually have multiple camshafts, such as a Dual Overhead Camshaft (DOHC). If you have a DOHC engine which is also a ""V"" configuration it is possible to have as many as 4 camshafts.

, Removing the timing cover is one of the most difficult parts of an in-car installation, if you're going to attempt it without pulling the engine. The oil pan must be lowered enough to remove the timing cover while also clearing the crankshaft snout. With the cover off the engine, remove the three upper timing-chain bolts, along with the lower timing gear if a new timing chain is to be installed. This process will vary, depending on your make and model, but generally you'll have to start by disconnecting the battery lines, then removing the radiator cap and releasing the valve under the passenger's side to drain it.


Once the coolant is drained and the accessories are out of the way, remove the intake-manifold bolts. A small hammer and chisel or flat-head screwdriver may be needed to pry the intake manifold from the engine block. Scrape the front and rear block rails clean of cork, silicone, oil, or any other gunk, if necessary.

, This will allow you to access the rockers, pushrods, and lifters. Keep the rockers and pushrods in order. While you remove the rocker nuts, the engine may have to be turned over a few times in order to take valve spring pressure away from certain rocker-to-valve stem contact points.


Remove the Mass Air Flow (MAF) and Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor assembly, if necessary. Unbolt the radiator tray and remove it. Unbolt and detach the Manifold Air Temperature (MAT) tubes from the manifold.
Remove the spark plug wires, disconnecting the wiring harness leading to the coil packs and remove the coil packs from the valve covers. Detach the hoses from the valve covers and remove the valve covers to access the crankshaft.

, Turn the camshaft wheel until you see the V-shaped timing mark at the top. If these timing marks are not aligned properly during assembly, the camshaft will be out of phase with the crankshaft and the valves may be damaged if they strike the pistons.


If you need to adjust the timing afterward, you'll be able to make specific tweaks, but it's still good to make sure you've got the mark recorded so you can install the cam safely.

, Though using a camshaft removal tool is ideal, if your budget is tight you can work the cam out of the engine block by twisting it slowly and carefully, taking precaution not to scratch or gall the bearings.


If you want to change the timing wheel, chain, or any other components in the assembly, you'll also want to remove these, correspondingly.

, The camshaft and valve gear components should be washed in solvent, to remove grease and dust accumulated during transport, to ensure a clean installation. Dry the parts thoroughly before installation, laying them out on paper towels or shop rags.Don't soak hydraulic lifters, which will be compromised by cleaning solvents.
Before installing your new camshaft, make sure to check the part numbers of the camshaft and valve gear components against the manual, to avoid any mismatch of equipment due to a shipping error or a mistake at the shop.

, Cam lobes and bearings need to be coated with oil conditioner, which is usually included with new part kits. Rotate the cam while it's in the block, applying the oil in small amounts. Be careful to avoid scratching the cam bearings.


Move the cam as far back as the plug at the rear of the block will allow, and fasten the upper timing gear.

, The timing chain and sprocket can be assembled after you've lubricated the parts. To align the timing, you need to set the timing gear to Top Dead Center (TDC) and torque the assembly to the proper specifications, which will differ, depending on the brand of the component.Most gears will be marked with a notch or a green dot to help set TDC. Rotate the gear until the mark is at roughly 12 o'clock. Always defer to the manufacturer's directions.
With the camshaft in place, the upper timing gear should have its timing dot in the 6 o'clock position; the lower timing gear should show its zero-degree marking in the 12 o'clock position. Checking this will ensure proper valve train movement and allow the engine to respond the way the camshaft is intended to.

, Make sure oil does not leak from the front of the engine. Apply silicone between the oil pan and timing-cover seal contact points, then tighten the oil pan back into place.


If the gasket is undamaged, it can be cleaned before spreading a thin layer of silicone between the pan and the block.

, Always use a new set of lifters, checking each to make sure it can move unimpeded after you assemble it. If it doesn't, the cam and lifter will be distributed incorrectly, which can result in engine failure.


Lubricate each of the the new lifters, dropping them into their place. Install the pushrods through the cylinder heads, install the rocker arms, and put the pushrods against the rocker cups.

, Reinstall the water pump and reconnect both heater hoses. Compress the belt tensioner and replace the drive belt.. Reinstall the radiator and refasten all of those hoses, reconnecting the tubes in the fill neck.


Secure the wiring harness to the fan shroud and replace the radiator tray and the MAF assembly. Refill the radiator with a 50/50 mix of coolant and water. Inspect the engine for any loose connections and then reconnect the battery cables.

, Turn the ignition and let the engine run, without starting, for a few seconds. Reconnect the coil pack harness if there are no problems.


You may need to adjust the timing, using a timing gun, if you want to optimize the cam function.

, Let the car idle, pressing the gas pump if it threatens to stall. When the engine is running at full temperature, replace the radiator cap.

Understand that NOx is produced in the combustion chamber at temps higher than 2500F.,
Make sure that if equipped with a catalytic converter, it has not been removed.,
Make sure the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation/Re-combustion) system is functioning properly, and particularly, that the EGR ports are clear.,
Now to the lean condition.,Turn the ignition key to the ""OFF"" position.,Remove the electrical connector from the MAF sensor.,Remove the three screws and gently remove the sensor, careful not to damage the small resistor and wire at the opposite end of the sensor.,Using carburetor cleaner or brake cleaner, spray the resistor and wire thoroughly, you can use a toothbrush but be careful not to break the tiny wire.,
Reinstall the MAF, making sure the screws are snug, and the electrical connection is plugged in completely.",How to Fix GM NOx Failure," The richer the air to fuel ratio (less than 14.7/1), the cooler the combustion will be, the leaner the air to fuel ratio (more oxygen), the hotter the combustion is and more NOx is produced. These particular engines either equipped or not with an EGR system may produce excessive NOx due to a lean condition.
, This device is located underneath the car in the exhaust system, between the exhaust manifold and the muffler., To check if the EGR ports are clear, start the engine and let it idle; using hot-gloves or a rag, reach underneath the EGR valve and push the diaphragm actuator rod upward. If the engine stalls or runs very rough, then the EGR ports are clear. If no (or very little change) occurs in engine RPM, then the EGR ports are plugged and must be cleared first (See repair manuals or Google it). Retest as mentioned., Air volume entering from the air duct through the air filter is measured by the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor, usually located just before the throttle body and held down by three small screws.,,,,, Have the vehicle's emission gas retested to make sure it is in compliance with state guidelines."

Locate the heater core on the vehicle’s firewall.,
Disconnect the heater hoses.,
Point the inlet hose down toward the container.,
Insert an airline or water hose into the outlet hose.,
Seal the line.,
Turn on the hose or air compressor.,
Allow the coolant and grime to drain.,
Repeat the process with the water hose.,
Reconnect the inlet and outlet hoses.,
Refill the coolant system.,
Park the vehicle on level ground.,
Allow the engine to cool completely.,
Jack the vehicle up.,
Place a container beneath the vehicle to catch drained fluids.",How to Flush a Heater Core," The heater core inlet and outlet pipes are usually located on the firewall separating the engine from the cabin of the vehicle. Its location will vary from vehicle to vehicle so if you have difficulty locating the inlet and outlet hoses, refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle.There will be two nozzles, one for the flow of coolant in and the other for the flow of coolant out.
You can locate the nozzles by following the coolant hoses through the coolant system.;
, Most coolant hoses are attached using hose clamps that will need to be loosened with either a screw driver or wrench. Remember, when you disconnect the heater hoses, coolant and water will pour from them, so be sure the container is placed directly beneath the hoses below the car.If you damage the hose clamp as you loosen it, you can purchase replacement clamps at your local auto parts store.
Be careful not to spill coolant on the ground, as it is bad for the environment.

, In order to clean the blockage out of the heater core, you will need to force either air or water through the system. As you do so, the coolant, water and grime within the system will be expelled through the inlet hose.Be sure the hose is positioned so anything that comes out of it will pour into the container.

, If you have an air compressor, you can use an airline to push out the remaining coolant and grime within the heater core. If not, you can use a garden hose for the same purposes. Place the airline or hose in the outlet hose from the heater core.You will need to use a water hose to flush the system either way, but compressed air may move harder to break blockages.

, Try your best to seal the line where the hose or airline connect the to the heater hose outlet. Wrapping the area with duct tape or using silicone couplers are both effective ways to create a seal.If there is a serious blockage in the line, pressure may leak back out the hose rather than penetrating the clog.
A good seal around the hose pushing air or water into the system will force the pressure to go through the clog.

, With the airline or hose sealed as well as you can to the heater hose outlet, turn on the air or water. Allow the pressure to build in the system to remove any clogs. The coolant and grime will drain out of the heater inlet and into the container beneath the vehicle.Leave the hose or airline running for a few minutes to ensure it pressurizes the entire system.

, Turn off the airline or water hose and allow the fluids to finish draining into the container you placed beneath the vehicle. Be sure the container does not overflow if you are using a hose.The system will likely continue to drain for a few minutes after you turn off the flow of air or water.

, If you used an airline to remove the initial blockage, switch to a hose now and repeat the process. Filling the system with water and allowing it to drain will remove any bad coolant.You may want to pour the container out into a separate, sealable container between flushes to ensure it doesn’t overflow.
Flush the system one or two times before moving on.

, Place the heater inlet and outlet hoses back on the nozzles and secure them again with the hose clamps. This will reseal the system and allow you to refill it. Be sure to securely fasten the hose clamps, otherwise the water pressure will cause the hoses to come off.Replace damaged or rusty hose clamps before reinstalling the hoses.
The hoses can usually only reach one nozzle, so it is easy to determine which goes where.

, Open the radiator cap and refill the coolant system with a 50/50 mix of water and coolant. Be sure to use the correct type of coolant for your vehicle. Once you have filled the system to capacity, screw the radiator cap back into place.You can purchase pre-mixed coolant and water or you may choose to mix it yourself.
If you are unsure of what kind of coolant is right for your vehicle, ask the clerk at your local auto parts store for assistance.

, You should never jack up a vehicle on a slanted surface or the jack may topple over. Find a firm, level surface that can support the weight of the front of the vehicle once it is centralized beneath the jack.Black top and concrete are the best surfaces to jack a vehicle up on.
Never jack up a vehicle on grass, dirt or gravel.

, The coolant system is pressurized when heated, so loosening or disconnecting the heater core hoses while the engine is warm could cause it to spray hot coolant and injure you. Wait a few hours after the last time the engine was running before starting this project.Touch your hands on the hood of the car. If it is slightly warm, the engine inside is likely still quite hot.
It may take a number of hours for an engine to cool completely.

, Slide a trolley or scissor jack beneath the vehicle at one of its designated jack points. Lift and lower the handle (trolley jack) or turn it (scissor jack) to jack the car up.If you are unsure where to locate the designated jack points for your vehicle, refer to your owner’s manual for guidance.
Once the vehicle has been jacked up, slide jack stands beneath it to support the weight of the vehicle.

, You will need to flush all of the coolant and grime out of the heater core and a portion of the coolant system into a container on the ground. Be sure the container can hold at least the capacity of your vehicle’s coolant system.Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle to find out its coolant capacity.
Be sure the container you choose does not leak and preferably can be sealed to transport the coolant to a recycling center.

Pour in the head gasket sealer.,
Drive the vehicle for fifteen to twenty minutes.,
Re-evaluate the state of the vehicle’s head gasket.",How to Fix a Head Gasket With Engine Block Sealer," When a head gasket begins to leak, a common symptom that will arise is “mayonnaise” under the oil filler cap. It is called mayonnaise because a film develops on the underside of the oil filler cap that resembles the condiment.A white, creamy buildup on the underside of the oil filler cap is sometimes referred to as “mayonnaise” and indicates a leaking head gasket.
A lack of white build up does not necessarily mean the head gasket is not leaking.;
, When a head gasket fails, coolant leaks into the cylinders and is burned along with the air and fuel mixture. Burning coolant produces a different color exhaust than the vehicle will produce normally and will appear white or grey instead of the normal dark shades.As the leak in the head gasket grows, the exhaust will become whiter.

, When changing your oil look at the oil you drained for signs of coolant. A leak in the head gasket will allow coolant to seep into the oil of the vehicle, but coolant and oil are different consistencies so they will naturally separate.Light swirls in the oil are likely caused by coolant.
If there is enough coolant to make out the color, coolant is usually green, orange or pink.

, A misfire in your vehicle will feel like a slight to severe vibration that resonates throughout the vehicle. You may notice a shudder in the RPMs in the tachometer that coincides with the vibration. This vibration may be caused by coolant penetrating the cylinders and failing to ignite.A misfire will often result in the check engine light coming on in your dashboard.
A leaking head gasket is one of a number of issues that may cause the check engine light to come on.

, If the check engine light comes on in your vehicle, use an OBDII Code Scanner to check the error code in the engine’s computer. The error code may provide you with an insight into what the issue is with the car.If the error code indicates a misfire, it may be a result of a bad head gasket.
Many auto parts stores will use their OBDII scanner to check your codes for free.

, A bad head gasket will compromise the vehicle’s ability to regulate temperature. If the engine in your vehicle is running hotter than normal or begins to overheat, that may be a symptom of a leaking head gasket.If your vehicle is overheating, immediately pull over and shut the engine off.
Driving an overheating vehicle can cause significant internal damage to the engine and cylinder head.

, In order to access the low point in the coolant system, you will need to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to work beneath it. Jack up the vehicle by inserting a jack beneath one of the vehicle’s designated jack points and lifting and pressing or turning the handle.Once the vehicle is jacked up, place jack stands beneath it to support the weight.
If you are unsure of where to find the designated jack points for your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual.
Never work on a vehicle supported only by a jack.

, You’ll need a container that is large enough to catch all of fluids you drain from the coolant system of the vehicle twice over. If you do not have a container that is large enough, choose a bucket that is large enough to hold the capacity of the coolant system once, then pour it into a container you can seal before draining the system into the bucket a second time.Place the container beneath the radiator on the end with the petcock.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual to determine the coolant capacity you will need to keep in a container.

, Use a wrench to open the petcock on the bottom of the radiator to drain the coolant and water out of the coolant system and into your container. Allow it to drain completely before closing the petcock again.Be careful not to allow any of the coolant to leak from the container as it is bad for the environment.
Opening the radiator cap will allow the system to drain quicker.

, Once the coolant system is empty, use the same wrench to close the petcock securely. With the petcock closed, refill the coolant system with water only by opening the radiator cap and pouring it in.If the radiator cap appears to be severely worn or damaged, you should replace it by purchasing a new one at your local auto parts store.
Check in the service manual for your vehicle if you are unable to locate the radiator cap.

, The thermostat in your vehicle helps maintain operating temperature by opening to allow the coolant to pass through the radiator and be cooled by air flow when it becomes too hot. Disconnect the thermostat to prevent it from engaging as you add the sealant.Disconnect the line leading to the top of the thermostat.
Check the service manual for your specific vehicle to help you find the thermostat if you are unsure.

, Once you have refilled the system with water, start the vehicle again to cycle the water through the coolant system so you can flush the remainder of the coolant out when you drain it.Allow the vehicle to run for ten minutes or so.
Keep an eye on the temperature gauge and turn the vehicle off immediately if it begins to overheat.

, Once the water has had an opportunity to run through the coolant system, reopen the petcock and drain the water into a container as well. Allow it to drain completely before closing the petcock again.This is the same process you would use to drain and flush your coolant system.
The water will flush out the coolant that was elsewhere in the coolant system the first time you drained it.
Reconnect the thermostat during this step.

, Refill the coolant system with a 50/50 mixture of coolant and water. Ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to help you determine which coolant is the appropriate kind for your specific vehicle.You can purchase pre-mixed coolant and water, or you may choose to mix it yourself.
Add coolant through the radiator cap and give it a minute to drain into the system, then continue to add more until you reach the coolant capacity.

, Pour the head gasket sealer into the open radiator cap. Read the instructions on the specific brand you purchased for instructions that may be unique to the type of head gasket sealer you chose.You can usually simply pour the sealer into the radiator cap along with the coolant and water.

, The sealer will need to travel throughout the coolant system in order to reach the head gasket. Start the motor and allow it to run or drive the vehicle for fifteen or twenty minutes to allow the sealer to travel throughout the system.Again, if the vehicle begins to overheat, stop the engine immediately.
After fifteen to twenty minutes, stop the vehicle and allow it to sit for a few hours.

, Re-evaluate the head gasket leak in your vehicle using the same qualifications you used to determine there was an issue in the first place. A head gasket sealer can be a fairly permanent solution in some situations, while it may fail to solve the problem at all in some others.Keep an eye out for the symptoms of a leaking head gasket after using a head gasket sealer.
Having the head gasket replaced is the only truly permanent solution to a leaking head gasket.

Listen for a leak as a pipping, snapping or a popping sound or a larger leak may be a ""grrr, brrr"" (growling) sound.",How to Easily Remove a Cylinder Head on an Auto With Frozen Bolts," This is because the nuts going to the stud bolts in both areas are usually rusted and frozen and cannot be removed without breaking them off, and then extracting the broken stud.

The cross-over pipe usually looks like a ""Y"" shaped tube which connects the two exhaust manifolds to the exhaust pipe. However, in some older vehicles the crossover curved around the front of the block to the other side, not a Y. Be certain to cut only the arm going to the cylinder head you are removing. Exception: if you're removing both cylinder heads, you'll have to cut both sides loose.

, Loosen any bolts fastening the EGR valve to the engine. Inspect the gasket lining the bottom plate of the valve. If it's not frayed or cracked, you can reuse it.

, Use carburetor cleaner and a small-bristled brush like a wire brush, toothbrush or pipe cleaner to clean off the carbon from the metal exhaust gas return tube and the gas entry port on the valve (usually the smaller hole with a spring-loaded pin, or “pintle”).


If there is a lot of carbon build up around the EGR valve, you may also want to just save yourself some time and replace it with a new one.

, The entry port is where the valve tubes connect to the engine (usually the intake manifold) while the EGR valve is off.

, Check to ensure the vacuum diaphragm moves freely, reinstall the EGR valve and reattach the exhaust return and vacuum hoses.

, You need to do more than just visually inspect the belts. Pinch, squeeze and twist them, looking for cracks, fraying, splits or brittle places.


On a serpentine belt, also look for missing grooves or places where the belt's layers have separated.

, Slick spots can cause a belt to slip and may be precursors to overheating and cracking.

, Look for a buildup of rubber deposits, as well as worn spots that could catch the belt and cause it to break.


Also check the belts' alignment on the pulleys. They should line up straight on the pulleys.

, Check the tension on the longest length of the belt; there should be no more than one-half to one inch (1.25 centimeters to 2.5 centimeters) of give.

Put the engine compression gauge into the first cylinder's spark plug hole (this is the hole that is nearest to the drive belt).,
Ask a helper to crank the engine over continuously.,
Repeat the engine compression test for the other cylinders until you have tested all of the cylinders on your engine.

",How to Do a Compression Test," This can be done in the following ways.


If you haven't driven your car recently then the engine is most likely cold. Start your vehicle as usual and keep the engine running for a few minutes. This should warm up the engine to its normal operating temperature; however you should be careful not to overheat the engine by keeping it started for too long. Usually keeping the engine started for 20 minutes is sufficient.
Turn off the car engine and allow the engine to cool if you have recently taken your car for a drive. If the engine is hot, it should be given approximately 1 hour to rest before you do a compression test on it.
If you can't start the car engine then just continue with the test anyway. Even though you won't be able to test the engine's performance accurately you will still be able to diagnose that the engine is faulty due to its internal compression if you get a low reading.;
,, This will disable the fuel system so fuel will not be injected into the cylinders.

, This will disable the ignition system since the ignition coil pack will be unable to create and distribute the spark from the spark plug.

, Handle the spark plugs cautiously since the ceramic insulator of a spark plug can break or malfunction if not handled delicately.

, Don't use any additional tools to tighten the compression gauge, you should only use hand force.

, The needle on the pressure gauge will rise and once the needle has risen to its maximum reading your helper should stop the engine. This maximum reading is the maximum compression value for the first cylinder that you have just tested.

, Try turning on your headlights, if your headlights are burning normally then your battery should be sufficiently charged. If the headlights are dim or do not turn on at all you may need to jumpstart your car.

, To rule out a blown fuse you should take a quick look in your fuse box. Blown fuses can usually be identified by a black or burnt looking spot in the middle of the fuse. Any fuse in question should be checked with a light tester or replaced.

, You should choose an area that has plenty of space for you to move around the front and sides of your vehicle. You also want a well-lit area so that you can see what you are doing. Be sure to turn your vehicle off before proceeding.

, It is best to have everything you need easily accessible. Gather any hand tools you might need including wrenches, a mult-meter, a test light, and a spark plug tester.

, This will prevent fuel from being pumped into the cylinders while the ignition system is disabled. Filling up the cylinders and failing to ignite the fuel will flood your engine.

, These wires carry high voltage so exercise extreme caution when handling them. Insert a spark plug tester into the plug boot (end of the wire) and ground it on a piece of clean, unpainted metal on the engine.Have someone crank the engine and watch for a spark. If you have a good spark on all wires look for timing problems or other issues. If you do not have a good spark in all wires then you may have an electrical problem in your ignition system.

, The distributor is responsible for taking the high voltage generated in the ignition coil and passing it on to the spark plugs in a synchronized pattern.It is connected to each plug wire, and you can trace back your plug wires to find the distributor cap. Some newer cars do not have a distributor and instead an engine control module (ECM) coordinates the firing of the plugs. If this is true for your car, ignore any steps involving the distributor or distributor cap.

, You should remove the distributor cap by removing the screws or clips that hold it on. Have a friend turn the key and crank the engine. If you notice that the distributor is not turning, then you may have a broken timing belt or chain.

, This will turn power on to the electrical components of your ignition system. This allows you to test which parts and wires are getting the current that they need to operate.

, This part is responsible for generating the high voltages needed to fire your spark plugs. The coil should have three wires attached to it. A thin power (positive) wire coming from the ignition switch, a thin ground (negative) wire going from the coil to the ignition module, and a thick coil wire going from the coil to the distributor cap., Check for power using a test light.


If this wire has no power, then your ignition coil is not receiving current. You should check the wiring from your ignition switch to the coil for breaks in the wire and repair them.
If this wire has power, then the wiring from the ignition switch to the coil is working properly and you can move on.

, Using a test light check for power. The test light should light up indicating power on the negative side of the coil with the key on and engine off. If the light does not come on, you have a break in the coil wire and should trace the length of this wire (between the ignition module and ignition coil) and repair any breaks.

, It is ideal if you can have a friend turn the key to crank the engine. If you observe the test light flickering when cranking the engine, you should:


Trace the negative wire all the way to the ignition module looking for any breaks in the wire. If there are any breaks in the wire, they must be repaired.
If there are no breaks in the wire, use an Ohm meter to test the resistance of your ignition coil. Your service manual should specify resistance values for the primary and secondary coils. If your coil does not register the proper resistance, then you will need to replace your ignition coil.

, This is where wiring comes in from the ignition module.

,


If you observe no current then your pulse generator has likely malfunctioned. If this is the case you will need to replace it.
If you observe a current then your pulse generator is likely operating properly. This may indicate that your ignition module is not functioning and you must replace it.

, If all other components are functioning properly and there are no breaks in your wiring system, then you may have a bad ECM. At this point you should consider taking your vehicle to a professional to diagnose the problem.

If your car is constantly overheating, this could be a sign that your head gasket has blown.;
, If your head gasket is blown, coolant may be leaking from the cooling system.

, Check the colour of your oil. If it’s white and milky looking, or if your oil dipstick reveals a frothy substance, chances are your oil has mixed with the coolant and your head gasket has blown.

, If you spot white smoke emerging from your exhaust pipe, this could mean that the coolant has leaked into the combustion chamber.

, Disconnect all the lines running to the air conditioner.

, Refer to your service manual and pay close attention to the tightening sequence for the head bolts that hold the head gasket in place, as these must be loosened in the correct reverse order.

, Be sure to thoroughly clean the cylinder head, so that the new head gasket sits correctly.

,  You’ll need a torque wrench to do so, as the bolts must be torqued to a specific tightness, relevant to your particular vehicle. It’s crucial that these bolts are torqued correctly, as otherwise you may cause damage to your new head gasket.

, Reconnect the hoses in the order in which you disconnected them, replace the alternator, and ensure that all necessary parts are once again in place.

, Allow the engine to run for several minutes before switching it off and checking your new head gasket for any leaks.

Check each hose for bulges and swelling.,
Examine the hoses for tiny cracks and scratches.",How to Check Engine Vacuum Hoses1," If a hose feels soft or spongy when you touch it, this can indicate damage caused by your car's oil.


A swollen hose that is cracked and hard is often caused by heat damage. These hoses can be too close to heat sources under the hood or it may be the result of overheating.
Bulging hoses can also be caused by electrochemical degradation when there's a coolant leak dripping onto hoses. Sometimes you can feel tiny cracks or weak spots when you squeeze a cool hose near one of the ends.;
, Small parallel cracks in the cover of a hose can be ozone damage. Scratches and other irregular injuries to the hoses can be caused by hoses rubbing against a moving part of the engine.

Locate the spark plugs in your car (refer to owners manual).,
Let the engine cool before removing your spark plugs.,
Remove the first spark plug.,
Measure the gap of the spark plug.,
Check the existing plugs for wear.,
Get the correct replacement plugs.,
Consider cleaning around the threads before reinserting the new spark plugs.,
Insert the new plugs and tighten with your ratchet.,
Lubricate the plugs prior to installing them.",How to Change Spark Plugs in a Car," When you open the hood or bonnet of your car, you should see a bundle of 4-8 wires leading to different points on the engine compartment. The spark plugs are located at the engine end of these wires, under the plug covers that attach them.









On a 4-cylinder engine, spark plugs will be located on the top or side of the engine in a row.
On an inline 6-cylinder, they are located on the top or side of the engine head. On V6 and V8-cylinder engines, plugs should be separated evenly on each side of the engine.
Some cars have engine covers you'll have to remove to see the spark plug wires, tracing them back to find the plugs themselves. You should always check your owner's manual and look up where your spark plugs are, how many you have, the correct ""gap"" and the size socket needed to remove them. You should also number the corresponding leads to the cylinder so as not to confuse which lead goes where when replacing with new plugs. At this point, it is good practice to inspect the leads for any damage or cracks as replacement leads may also be required.;
, If you've been running the car for a while, the plugs and the entire engine and exhaust system manifold can get extremely hot. Only remove them when the engine is cool enough to touch. In the mean time, assemble your tools while you wait for your engine to cool. To change your spark plugs, you'll need:









A ratchet socket drive wrench
An extension bar
Spark plug socket, usually included in most ratchet socket sets
A spark gap gauge or feeler gauge, available at any auto parts store

, Pull the wire plug from the engine by gripping it as closely to the bottom as possible and working it gently and carefully off to reveal the spark plug. Don't yank on the wire to pull out of the plug, or you've got a bigger job on your hands and a ruined spark plug lead . Fit your socket wrench with the extension bar and use the ratchet to remove the spark plug from its housing slowly and with caution.









When checking to see if the plugs need replacing, simply remove one spark plug and check the gap. If contacts are burnt out, refit the plug and lead to the correct torque setting then go to the auto parts store and get new plugs before removing any more. You will need to remove the plugs one at a time, keeping track of the order. Spark plugs fire in a specific order, and crossing a wire to the wrong plug will make the engine run rough or not at all and can cause damage to your engine.
Remember: If you take out more than one spark plug at a time, keep track of your leads and the corresponding plugs by marking them with small pieces of masking tape. Label each wire numerically, then give the corresponding plug the same number.

, This number should be a specific measurement anywhere between .028-.060 inch, with a bit of wiggle room depending on your particular set of plugs and your car. These days, most plugs come preset according to the model number of the plug and their application, but it is wise to double check. Refer to your owner's manual to find out the optimum distance for your spark plug gap and use a gap checker or feeler gauge to check the distance.









If the distance of the spark plug gap is higher than it should be, but the plug is still of a relatively high quality and is an adjustable-gap plug, you can either try to change the gap by gently tapping the plug on a wooden surface with the gauge in between the plug gap until the desired measure is set at the correct measurement, or you can simply buy new plugs. It's usually recommended that you replace the plugs after every 20,000 Km or 12,000 miles or as indicated in your vehicle owners manual. Spark plugs are not overly expensive, and it's a good idea to replace them at regular intervals for trouble free motoring and a proper spark.If you're going to start changing your own plugs, invest in proper tools and equipment, such as a fine gap checker. It's basically a metal ring you can use to see if the electrodes are close enough to fire properly. Feeler gauges are even more precise and give a wider range of applications. The same goes for parts: aways buy quality and or genuine parts, it is worth a few dollars more for peace of mind and reliability.

, It is normal for the spark plug to appear somewhat dirty even if the plug is working properly, but you will need to change your spark plugs if you see any white, limey build up around the electrodes of the plugs, or if you see any evidence of burning or parts of the electrode missing. Heavy, sooty build-up also suggests that you need to change your plugs.









If the plugs are bent, black, or broken, you may have a mechanical problem with your engine and should consult a qualified mechanic or your local car dealer repair shop without undue delay.

, You can either consult your owner's manual or the booklet at the auto parts store that corresponds to your particular make and model and year of manufacture. There are literally hundreds of different combinations of spark plugs and measurements, ranging in price from less than two dollars to 15 dollars, made of platinum, yttrium and iridium, etc. Plugs made of precious metals (such as iridium and platinum) are typically more expensive than lesser metals (like copper) and the coatings resist wear much better. If you are unsure, talk to your auto parts dealer for advice or refer to you local car dealer's spare parts department for original equipment plugs.A good rule of the thumb is to get the same plugs you have in the car currently. Never downgrade to a less expensive plug and don't think too hard about fixing something that works already. The manufacturer installed those plugs for a very good reason, so simplify the process and get the same ones when possible, provided they were the correct ones fitted! Check you manual or with your local dealer.
You can typically buy fixed gap or adjustable gap spark plugs, so it's up to you if you want to check your plugs regularly and make minute adjustments. If you do, get adjustable plugs. Above all, you need to make sure the gap measurement is the correct measurement for your car. If you check it yourself, you'll know for sure. Remove it from the package and do a quick check to verify the measurement.

, When you're changing your plugs, it's also a good opportunity to check the wires for wear and to clean up around the wire terminal. Use a wire brush or compressed air to clean up around the wire connections and make sure you've got a good, clean port. Replace the wires if necessary.

, Using the spark-plug socket, remove each plug from the engine, and replace each with a new spark plug. Tighten a bit (say, 1/8th of a turn) past hand-tight only. Never over-tighten the plugs as you can easily strip the thread on the head of the engine, and repairs are costly and time consuming. Remember to replace the spark-plug cables on the same plugs they originally came from, and to remove the masking tape once done. If you prefer, you can find the torque specification for the plugs in your vehicle's service manual (not owner's manual) and use a ratchet with a torque setting.








, Try putting a very small amount of anti-seize lubricant on the plug threads if you are installing them in an aluminum engine. The anti-seize prevents a reaction between dissimilar metals. You can also use a small amount of dielectric silicone compound on the inside of the spark plug wire boot to make the plugs easier to remove in the future. Always turn the plug backwards on the thread until you have located the hole correctly so as not to cross-thread your new plug to avoid damaging the head and plugs. Make sure you put the spark plug wire boot back on the spark plug. You may have to push on it a little harder to get it to ""snap"" on. If you don't put it on correctly, you could cause the engine to misfire (which will make the ride feel very shaky and rough).

Spray the sensors with WD-40.,
Fill a bucket or industrial container with gasoline.,
Unscrew the oxygen sensors from their housing.,
Immerse the sensors in a container of gasoline.,
Cover the bucket with a lid.,
Allow the sensors to soak overnight.,
Remove and dry the sensors.,
Reinstall the oxygen sensors in your vehicle.",How to Clean an Oxygen Sensor," Since you’ll be dealing with gasoline and various car parts, it’s important to protect yourself from potential harm. Before you begin to lift your car and locate the oxygen sensor, put on a sturdy pair of work gloves to protect your hands. You should also wear a pair of protective eyeglasses or goggles in case any WD-40 or gasoline comes near your eyes.Both work gloves and protective eyewear can be purchased at your local hardware store, or at a large retail store such as a WalMart.;
, In order to remove the oxygen sensor, you’ll need to have access to the underside of your vehicle. Make sure that the vehicle is on level ground, is in “Park,” and that the emergency break is engaged before lifting the car. Place the jack under part of your vehicle’s chassis (including an axis or the side of the car frame) and lift the vehicle.You can purchase a car jack at any auto-parts store. Speak with the sales staff and let them know the type and size of vehicle you have, so they can recommend an appropriate jack.

, Depending on the make and model of your vehicle, it may have more than one oxygen sensor. Check your vehicle’s owner’s manual for the exact locations of the sensors. All vehicles have at least two oxygen sensors: one in front of your car’s catalytic converter, and one in the car’s exhaust manifold.If your vehicle has more than one exhaust manifold, there will likely be an oxygen sensor inside each one.


The oxygen sensor will look something like a spark plug: roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. One end will have a hexagon shape—for a wrench to fit over—and the other end will be threaded to screw into your vehicle.

, As your vehicle’s oxygen sensors are seldom removed, they will probably be firmly stuck in place. To loosen them, spray the sensors with a lubricant like WD-40 and let them sit for 10–15 minutes. The WD-40 will lubricate and loosen the sensors, making them easier to remove.


If you don’t already have a can of WD-40 around the house, you can purchase one at any local hardware or auto-supply store.

, While you’re waiting for the WD-40 to lubricate the screw threads of the oxygen sensor, you can start the next step of the process. Fill a large bucket or industrial plastic container with gasoline, and set this near your vehicle. Once you have removed the oxygen sensors from your car, you’ll clean them by soaking them in the gasoline.Make sure that the bucket or container that you choose can safely contain gasoline. Not all types of containers will be gasoline resistant.
If you’re purchasing the bucket or container at a hardware store, ask the sales staff to recommend a sealable, gasoline-safe plastic.

, You’ll need to use a sturdy wrench for this. Each of the oxygen sensors should be well lubricated and loosened at this point; take your wrench and firmly loosen the sensors.As you remove the sensors from your vehicle, do not set them on the ground or allow them to get dirty. Place the sensors somewhere clean, such as in a plastic bowl or on a clean, flat spot on your vehicle.


If you’re not certain of the sensors’ wrench size, you can easily determine it by attempting to fit a medium-sized wrench over the head of the oxygen sensor. If the first wrench you try doesn’t fit, adjust the wrench size smaller or larger as necessary.
Alternately, use a wrench with an adjustable opening size.

, Once you have removed the oxygen sensors from your vehicle, submerge them in the bucket or industrial container that you’ve filled with gasoline. Given time, gasoline will clean the oxygen sensors. Make sure that the sensors are fully immersed in the gasoline, and that none of the liquid splashes out of the container or gets on your hands.Never smoke, light a candle, or have any other type of open flame when working near gasoline.

, Due to the flammable nature of gasoline, it’s important that you cover the bucket or industrial container of gasoline. This will prevent the gas from catching fire, and also keep any wandering animals from accessing the gas. If the industrial container came with a lid, you can use this to cover the gas.Make sure to seal the lid tightly.


If you’re soaking the sensors in a bucket or a container that does not have its own lid, you’ll need to find something to cover the opening with. Look for an appropriately sized lid among your pots and pans in the kitchen, or simply place a piece of plywood or a large book over the bucket opening.

, The gas won’t clean the oxygen sensors immediately; you’ll need to let them soak for at least 8 hours. At some point while the sensors are soaking in the container of gas, pick the container up and swirl it around several times. This will ensure that all parts of the sensors are being cleaned by the gasoline., After the sensors have soaked overnight, you’ll need to reach into the bucket or container of gasoline and remove the sensors. Note their appearance: they should be much cleaner than when you put them in. Then, using a clean cotton cloth, wipe the gasoline off of the oxygen sensors and dry them fully.In order to avoid getting gasoline on your hands, you can wear a pair of thick rubber gloves while removing the oxygen sensors from the gasoline.
You can use a pair of gloves similar to those that you would use to wash dishes.

, Once the oxygen sensors have been wiped dry, use your wrench to insert them back in the exhaust manifold(s) and the other locations from which you originally removed them. Fully tighten the oxygen sensors in place.To conclude this process, use the car jack to carefully and slowly lower your vehicle.
Start your vehicle and check to see if the “check engine” light is still on. It will likely have turned off; you may also notice that the cleaned oxygen sensors result in your car using substantially less gasoline.

, When fully assembled, cylinder heads contain numerous small parts that need to be removed before the cleaning process can begin. Most cylinder heads contain one or two camshafts, intake and exhaust valves with supporting hardware, and likely some ignition components such as spark plugs or ignition coils. All of these parts must be removed and stored safely while cleaning the cylinder head.Use care when removing the valve cover on the top of the cylinder head to prevent it from warping. Loosen all of the bolts first, then proceed to unscrew them the rest of the way.
Be careful not to lose any of the small pieces you removed.
Some components of the cylinder head may need to be pressed out of the head using a machine press. If you don’t have access to one, you may need to enlist the help of a machine shop.

, The process of cleaning your cylinder heads includes the use of chemical cleaning agents that are a serious hazard to your eyes and may irritate your skin due to prolonged contact. In order to protect yourself, make sure to wear appropriate safety equipment at all times while cleaning your cylinder heads.Eye protection such as safety glasses or goggles should be worn at all times when working with chemical cleaning agents.
Chemical resistant gloves will protect your hands from being irritated by the brake or parts cleaner. If you use a non-spray parts cleaner that you fill the tub with, you may want to use gloves that extend to your elbow if possible.

, Most cylinder heads are made of either iron or an aluminum alloy. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of the performance and lifetime of your vehicle, but more importantly, aluminum is a softer metal and may be more prone to damage in the cleaning process. To determine what kind of metal your cylinder heads are made out of, check in the service manual for your vehicle or use the following factors to help you decide:Aluminum heads are much lighter than iron ones, both in weight and in color. Light grey heads are likely made of aluminum while darker colors may indicate iron.
Iron is prone to rusting, while aluminum is not. If there are signs of surface rust on the heads, they are made of iron.
A magnet will not stick to an aluminum cylinder head, but it will stick to an iron one.

Use a plastic scraper to remove head gasket material.,
Place the cylinder head in the tub.,
Use parts cleaner and a rag to begin scrubbing the head.,
Fill the second tub with warm water.,
Submerge the cylinder head in the water.,
Remove the head and use a rag to wipe it down.,
Use a spray washer to clean the head.,
Have the cylinder head “hot tanked.” Hot tanks are another type of specialized equipment used to thoroughly clean automotive parts.",How to Clean Engine Cylinder Heads2," There is a good chance that there will still be some head gasket material remaining on your cylinder head. The head gasket creates a seal between the head and engine block (also sometimes referred to as the “top” end and “bottom” ends). Scrape off any remnants of the gasket using a plastic scraper. Be extremely careful not to scratch or damage the “mating surface” of the cylinder head where the gasket material can be found. Any scratch or damage can cause leaks that will lead to gasket failure once the engine is assembled again.Do not use a metal scraper or any tools that could feasibly damage the mating surface of the cylinder head.
Make sure to get all of the previous gasket material off of the head to allow for a proper seal when reinstalling.

, With the gasket material gone, place the cylinder head in the first tub. If you are using liquid parts cleaner, pour the parts cleaner into the tub with the cylinder head so you can use it as you clean. If you are using a spray cleaner, you will not need to fill the tub.Be careful when moving the cylinder head around. There are studs and vacuum line nozzles that will likely be sticking out your cylinder head that can be damaged if banged against walls or tables.
Depending on the situation, you may need help moving the cylinder heads into and out of the tubs, as they can be rather heavy.

, Use a rag and the cleaning agent of your choice to scrub every portion of the cylinder head that you can access. Pour or spray cleaner into the areas of the cylinder head that you are unable to reach. The cleaning agent will break up most carbon deposits and burnt oil, but you may need to scrub a bit in some areas.Do not use a steel tooth brush or anything else that could damage the mating surfaces of the cylinder head when scrubbing.
Take your time to ensure you clean every nook and cranny of the cylinder head.

, After you scrub your cylinder heads, fill the second tub up with warm water. Make sure the tub is tall enough to allow the cylinder head to be completely submerged in water, then fill it with enough water to completely cover the head. You may want to do the following step outdoors or in a room with a drain.Make sure the tub is large enough to allow the cylinder head to be completely submerged.
Use warm to hot water when filling the tub.

, Place the cylinder head in the water filled tub gently. The water will make its way through the areas of the cylinder head you were unable to access with your rag as well as helping to remove the cleaning agent you used in the previous step. Aluminum heads can be damaged by prolonged exposure to caustic cleaners so rinsing them off is imperative.Allow the head to sit in the water for a few minutes.
If the head isn’t completely submerged, add warm water until it is.

, After waiting a few minutes, carefully lift the head back out of the tub of water and place it on a stable counter. Use a clean rag to wipe the cylinder head down and remove as much water from it as possible. Make sure to wipe out any standing water that may collect in the nooks and crannies of the head.You will not be able to completely dry the cylinder head with a rag, but removing the majority of the water will help it to dry faster.
Do not reuse the rag with a cleaning agent on it. Make sure it is a new, clean rag.

, If you have access to a spray washer, which is a specific type of equipment designed to clean automotive parts, you can do a more effective job of cleaning the external and exposed internal areas of the cylinder head. Like cleaning it by hand, spray washers do a poor job of cleaning the internal surfaces that are hard to reach, but can dramatically reduce the labor required to clean the rest of the cylinder head.Spray washers are common in many professional garages and machine shops.
Smaller spray washers can be purchased at auto-parts stores, though the cost may be prohibitive if you do not intend to clean other parts.

, These tanks are filled with caustic cleaning agents that can reach all internal and external surfaces in the cylinder head. These tanks require significantly less labor than other cleaning options, as all you need to do is place the part in the tank and turn it on.Hot tanks are usually found in professional machine shops.
You may opt to have your cylinder heads hot tanked after cleaning them yourself to ensure your heads are as clean as possible.

Use compressed air to blow water out of hard to reach places.,
Allow the head to dry completely.,
Inspect the head for defects or damage.,
Oil and bag the head for storage.",How to Clean Engine Cylinder Heads3," After you’ve dried the cylinder head’s external surfaces with a rag, use a can of compressed air or an air compressor to spray out all of the narrow tunnels and openings in the cylinder head. This will dry the head as well as removing any dust or other debris that may have fallen into the head during the cleaning process.Spray air into every opening you can find in the cylinder head to ensure there is no remaining moisture or debris anywhere in the head.
Make certain that there is no debris of any kind in the cylinder head. Even small amounts of debris can seriously damage the cylinder head once installed.

, Leave the cylinder head on a counter to dry completely. Place paper towels over the top of the head to ensure dust does not fall into and settle in the newly clean and debris free head.Do not store a head while wet. Iron heads, in particular, will oxidize and rust if stored wet.

, Before re-assembling or storing your clean cylinder head, inspect it for any damage that may have resulted from the cleaning process or that may have occurred previously. Any cracks in the head will compromise its ability to function and blemishes, scuffs or scratches on the mating surface (the bottom of the cylinder head) will cause head gasket failure. If you notice any such damage, you may be able to have the cylinder head repaired at a machine shop, but you likely will need to purchase a new head.If you notice the cylinder head is still dirty in some places during your inspection, begin the cleaning process again.
Remember that it’s better to be safe than sorry. Reassembly and installation of a cylinder head will require a significant investment of time. If you are concerned that the head is damaged, have it looked at by a local machine shop.

, If you intend to store your cylinder head for a time before re-assembly, you will need to take preventative action to protect it from debris and oxidization while stored. Spray the head lightly with WD40 before enclosing it in a heavy duty plastic bag.Seal the plastic bag by tying it off or stapling it shut to make sure dirt can’t fall into by accident.
Make sure you store the cylinder head in a safe place where it won’t be damaged.

Connect the scan tool to the OBD-II data link connector.,
Read the results.",How to Change an EGR Valve1," A scan tool reads information from your On-board Diagnostics, version II (OBD-II) system. This system collects information from the sensors in your engine. If the sensor detects something wrong, it reports it as an error code to the OBD-II. A scan tool allows you to read this code. The scan tool plugs into OBD-II data link connector, which is usually located under the dash., The most common location for the OBD-II connector is under the dash by the steering wheel. The owner's manual should have the exact location if you have trouble finding it.

, Place your key in the ignition and turn it to on, but do not start the engine. You only want the electrical systems running.

, The scan tool will prompt you to fill in some information about your vehicle. It usually requires information about the make, model, engine, and year of the vehicle.


Most scan tools draw power from the vehicle’s battery and do not require a separate power source.

, The scan tool will display any error codes the OBD-II reports. If the result is in the P0400 to PR409 range, then the EGR valve may be faulty."

The multimeter has black (negative) and red (positive) leads with metal clamps that connect to the wiring in your engine.It’s recommended that you use a digital multimeter for this test. A digital multimeter will display only the test results. An analog multimeter will be harder to read because every possible result on its range is printed at the top.

, A large “V” denotes the voltage setting. The range for the volts is located between two bold lines.

, Consult your owner’s manual to find the exact location of the valve as it varies depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Once you have located the valve, look for an electrical connector on top of it. This connector will have the circuits you need to test.

, Each circuit on the EGR is labeled from ""A"" to ""E."" , The easiest and closest ground is the negative post on the vehicle’s battery.

, If the results on the multimeter show a reading above .9 Volts, then something (most likely carbon) is blocking the EGR valve. If the multimeter shows little or no voltage, then the EGR valve is most likely faulty. If the reading is between .6 and .9 Volts, then this means the EGR valve is working properly."

If you cannot find the correct EGR there, check a parts manual or with an associate at an auto parts stores., Wait for several hours before you begin working on your vehicle. You can injure yourself very easily while working on a hot engine so let it set a few hours., Use a wrench to loosen the clamps on the battery’s two terminals. Be sure to wait at least 5 minutes after disconnecting the battery before you begin working on the engine. You want the system to discharge completely.


Always wear the appropriate safety gear before working on your engine.

, The EGR is usually located on either the top or backside of the engine. Consult your owner’s manual if you need help finding it.

, Twist and pull each line until they slide off the EGR valve. Each line connects with a specific port. Label each one so that you can easily reconnect them. , The electrical cable is located on top of the EGR valve. Grab the electrical cable with your hands and pull it.


If the electrical cable is held in by a clip or clamp, use a flat-bladed screwdriver to press it down and release it.

, Use lubricant spray on the bolts because they are usually very tight.

, Now that you removed the bolts, use your hands to remove the valve from its mount.


Inspect the valve for signs of carbon buildup. Sometimes this buildup causes the valve to malfunction. If you find buildup, clean it off and reinstall the valve. Test the valve again to see if it works after cleaning it.

, Use a scratch awl or something similar to remove any carbon buildup. Clean any debris or building in the gasket case.


Use carburetor or intake cleaner to help remove the carbon.

, Thread the bolts through the EGR and gasket onto the mount with your hands first. Then use a socket wrench with a swivel extension to tighten the mounting bolts when you seat the EGR valve in the engine.


When purchasing a new valve, see if it comes with a new gasket. You will have to purchase one if it doesn’t.

, Plug the cable back into the top of the EGR valve using your hands.

, Reattach the line with using your hands. Make sure that it’s tight to prevent leaks.

, Attach the engine leads to the battery terminals. Use a wrench to tighten the bolts.

, If you used a scan tool to test your EGR valve, clear any error codes related to the valve. Then test again to see if any error codes appear.

, Start your engine and listen for any leaks near the EGR valve. The two possible places leaks might occur will be with the vacuum hose or exhaust. Drive the vehicle to make sure that it runs correctly. Pay close attention to the idling and gas mileage of your vehicle as poor performance in these areas indicate that the EGR valve is faulty.

Medium sized flat bladed screwdriver.,

Remove both valve covers by placing the screwdriver under the center of the valve cover bails (wire clips holding on the valve covers) and prying downward.,

Remove the distributor cap.,

Use the 19mm or 21mm wrench to turn the engine over by the generator / alternator pulley bolt (bolt holding the upper fan belt pulley on).,

Start the valve adjustment with cylinder #1, the forward most cylinder located on the passenger side of the vehicle.
,

Place #1 cylinder at top dead center (TDC).,

Using the feeler gauge, measure the gap between the adjusting screw and the top of the valve for both the intake and exhaust.,

Once the gauge is inserted in to the gap, tighten the adjusting screw gradually while sliding the gauge back and forth until there is a noticeable “drag"".
,

Hold the screw in its location with a screwdriver and tighten the nut with the 13mm wrench.,

, If you have AC, you may need to slip a shop rag through the bail and give both ends a sharp snap downward to get the bail loose.

The bail will move downward releasing the tension on the cover and you'll be able to work the cover off. Some oil will drip down at this point, don't worry, it will be a small amount.
Once it finishes dripping, use a rag to clean it off the heat exchangers.

,

The cap is held on by 2 clips, insert the screwdriver toward the top of the clip between the clip and the cap, gently pry outward and the clip will pop off the notches in the cap.
Don't remove the wires or the rotor inside the cap, just pull the cap up off the distributor and place it to the side suspended by the spark plug wires.

,

If the belt is loose, it may slip as you turn the bolt, when this happens, grab both sides of the belt as it enters and exits the upper pulley and squeeze them together with one hand.
Use the wrench to turn the pulley with the other, this will increase the tension enough to turn the engine over by this method.

,, Do this by watching the distributor rotor.

There is a small notch (oriented at about 4 o'clock) cut into the top edge of the distributor where the cap meets the metal distributor body. Rotate the engine until the rotor is pointing directly at the notch.
When it is lined up, look down at the crankshaft pulley (large pulley at the lower end of the fan belt). There will be a notch cut on the inside edge of the pulley that lines up with the split in the center of the engine case. It's a good idea to paint the notch with a small amount of visible paint (whiteout works for this but doesn't last). Line the notch up with the split, your engine is now at TDC for cylinder #1.

,

Sometimes the gauge won't fit between the adjuster and the valve stem, in that case break the lock nut loose on the adjustment screw, loosen the screw one turn and insert the feeler gauge.
If it requires more than one turn to get the gauge inserted, double-check TDC.

,,

Do not over tighten the lock nut.
It should be tight, not overly tight.

,, At the rear of the car using the 19mm or 21mm wrench, turn the engine counter-clockwise so the crankshaft (large) pulley turns 1/2 turn or 180 degrees.

There will be another notch on the pulley exactly 180 degrees or halfway around from #1's TDC point.
Line the notch up with the split, your engine is now at TDC for cylinder #2.

,,,,,,

Place the new gasket into a valve covers and place the cover on the head.
Lift up the bale till it clicks into the notch in the valve cover, A screwdriver may be required to get it the last of the way on.

Make sure to play it safe and perform this task in an open environment with plenty of personal space, such as a garage. Other materials you will need include:

18 mm wrench
metal pipe
socket wrench
13mm socket
12mm socket
10mm socket
pliers
bent hanger (optional)
18mm line wrench
pulley removal kit
air gun;
, Disassembling of the pump from the car will require that the belt tensioner be taken off. Acquire a wrench large enough to fit over the tensioner in order to pull it back. This will allow for the tension on the belt to loosen and removal of the belt to follow. Use an 18mm wrench or larger. In order to pull the tensioner back with ease, use a metal pipe that will fit over the handle of the wrench. This will apply the leverage needed to pull the tensioner back with ease. The tensioner is located directly to the left of the pulley wheel.

, The pulley bolts are placed at 6, 9 and 12 o’clock when looking directly at the wheel. You will need a 13mm socket and socket wrench.

, It is located on the opposite side of the pulley wheel. The bolt is a 12mm socket.

, The coolant hose is mostly just in the way and a hassle to work around. The power steering hose needs to be disconnected in order to remove the power steering pump. Use some pliers to remove the hose clamps. In order to stop too much coolant from leaking out, prop up your coolant hose. As an example, a bent hanger will do the job. Simply take an unused hanger and bend it so the hook feeds through the clamp on the coolant hose. Place the other side of the hanger wrapped through your cars hood latch. This will allow the hose to rest in place and out of harms way.

, To help with this, remove the 10mm bolt that is holding the hoses down.

, The power steering line needs to be removed next. Remember to use an 18mm line wrench. It’s important that it is a line wrench. Using any other tool may strip the power steering line when you are attempting to take it off.

, Purchase a power steering pulley removal kit. When you purchase this tool it can be returned for 100% your money back.


Removing the pulley can be kind of tricky at first. Don’t be afraid to beat on the tool a little bit in order to get it on and off the pulley.







, There should be 2-3 bolts depending on how well the filter was previously attached to the pump. Use a 12mm socket to remove the bolts.



When placing the filter on the new power steering pump, remember to pay attention to the O-rings. There is a specific O-ring around the larger of the two holes in the pump where the filer attaches. It is crucial this O-ring is replaced so that there are no leaks at the pump when everything is reassembled. The O-ring should wrap around the larger end of the filter before attaching it to the pump.







, The only thing left to do is to retrace the above steps and begin reassembling the power steering pump the way it was, but with the new pump in place."

Figure out your spark plugs' location and size.,
Get your tools and supplies ready.,
Clean the area around the spark plugs.Any dirt that has built up around the plug will fall into your cylinder when you pull out the plug.",How to Change Spark Plugs1," Almost all cars have spark plugs located in a row at the front of the engine (or possibly on the top depending on configuration). Some older V engines have spark plugs located to the sides of the engines. With a few exceptions, cars have one spark plug for each cylinder.








Make sure the engine is cool before you get started.
If you're having trouble locating the spark plugs, look for the black rubbery wires running around the engine. Follow them to the end and you'll find the spark plugs. Otherwise, some modern engines have a cover over the coils and plugs. The cover must be removed for access. This set up typically has the plugs going right down the center of the valve cover.
Check your car's owner manual for the exact location of the spark plugs and the spark plug size you need.;
, Once you've determine the size of your plugs, gather the tools and supplies you need. You just need a few things to change your spark plugs. Get a socket wrench with a spark plug socket extension that's the right size for your plugs, as well as a new set of spark plugs.


In the past, a gapping tool was always required to fit the plugs properly, but modern spark plugs now come pre-gapped.However, spark plug gaps may still be set incorrectly (even if preset). You should always check and set the gaps to be sure.
Having compressed air, a rag, and rubbing alcohol on hand can help the job go more smoothly.
If you want to make sure the plugs unscrew easily next time you need to replace them have a bottle of anti-seize on hand to apply a light coat over the threads of the plug before screwing it on.

, Nothing should go into that hole while the plug is out, so make sure the area is clean. Use compressed air to blow away dirt and debris around the spark plugs, to make it easier to see what you're doing. If there's a lot of buildup, clean it off with a rag and some rubbing alcohol.

Pull out the first spark plug by the boot.,
Inspect the well in the valve cover.,
Unscrew the old spark plug.,
Clean the threads.",How to Change Spark Plugs2," The boot is the connector that connects the spark plug wire to the engine. Grasp it and carefully pull it out to detach the spark plug.









Do not pull out more than one spark plug at once. Each spark plug must be connected in a specific place. If you pull them all out at once, you might have trouble figuring out where to reattach them, and that could lead to big trouble for your car. If you want to pull out more than one at once, write down or label each spark plug wire before you take it off. This is important, as on an 8 cylinder engine, you can easily forget which wire goes where.
Do not pull the spark plug out by the wire. Make sure you grasp and the boot. If you pull on the wire you could damage it, and new wires cost a few hundred bucks to replace.Twist the boot to aid in removing the spark plug boot from the plug.
If the boot is hard to pull out, you may need to use a pair of boot pliers to nudge it out.

, Spark plugs that are installed in center of the head, often through a well in the valve cover, need an extra step for inspection. When removing the plug boot, inspect the end to see if it is covered in oil. If not, look down the well with a flashlight and check for oil as well. If oil is found on the spark plug or valve cover, a valve cover reseal might be in order. You don't want oil to get in the cylinder, for damage may occur.








, Fit the socket wrench with the spark plug socket, and place the socket around the old spark plug. Turn it counterclockwise to unscrew the socket. It should come off easily. If you feel resistance, stop, move the wrench backward, and start over; forcing the plug to unscrew could cause damage to the setting.









When initially trying to loosen a plug, it could take some force to break it loose. If the vehicle is equipped with iron heads, and the plugs have been installed for a while, there could be some resistance along with some noise while removing the plug.
If the engine is equipped with aluminum heads, the plug should break lose and then come out easily. If the engine has aluminum heads and you are using a lot of force to remove the plug, stop and screw it back in, as it means the threads are damaged already. There is a good chance that the head might have to be removed to be repaired.

, The area where the spark plug screws into the wires should be free of dirt and debris before you install the new plug. Use rubbing alcohol and a rag to wipe away any grime before you continue.









Take a look at the electrode end of the old plug. Check to see if there is a carbon buildup on the electrode, or if the gap is filled with dirt. If it is oily, you may have worn rings, and you probably need to take your car to a mechanic to get them replaced. If the plug is tan, the engine is working properly.
Take a look at the porcelain in the center of the plug and look at the color. On most modern cars the color should be tan or an off white.

"
"
Double check that your replacement plug is the same size as the old plug.,
Seat the new plug.,
Replace the plug wire.,
Change the remaining plugs.,
Consider replacing your spark plug wires.",How to Change Spark Plugs3," The threaded part should be the same length, and the threads should match. If you're unsure what plug to buy, take an old one with you to the store and have the counter person match it for you. Also, they may be able to tell you the correct plug gap for your application.









Even though new plugs come pre-gapped, you might want to double check the gap of the new plug. It should be within the engine manufacturer's specifications. Plug gages are available at your local parts counter, usually for a dollar.

, Apply a little anti-seize on the threads so that the plug will unscrew easily next time you want to change it. Don't get any on the electrode, since that may cause it to fail. Screw the plug on by hand, twisting it clockwise, until it stays in place. Use a torque wrench fitted over the spark plug socket to finish screwing it on until it's fairly tight.









Do not over screw the plug; if you tighten it too much, you could cause damage to the part or the head.
There are some engines for which a torque wrench is absolutely necessary, because the spark plugs are indexed. Not getting the electrode into the proper position can cause damage. These engines often require plugs be purchased from the dealer so proper spark plug indexing is achieved.
The plug's washer should be compressed against the mounting surface.
For spark plugs in hard to reach areas, a piece of vacuum hose attached to the top of the plug will help align the plug and avoid cross threading as the plug is screwed in.

, Add a small amount of dielectric grease to the inside of the boot. Pick it up by the boot and place it back where it came from. The boot should snap in snugly. Give it a tug to make sure it stays in place.








, Working one plug at a time, use the same method to finish replacing all of the plugs.








, Inspect the wires for gouges or rips. If they look like they're in bad shape, look into changing them, too.

Strip the wire about 3/16"".,
Select the correctly sized seal and slip this over the wire's insulation.,
A high quality Weather Pack Crimping tool is very important for a good crimp.,
Notice this terminal positioning block on the back side of this crimper, that will be key to a perfect crimp.,
Slip the already stripped wire and seal assembly into the terminal.,
Squeeze the Weather Pack Connector tool's grip to crimp the terminal.

,
After the terminal has been crimped, the ratcheting mechanism of the crimping tool will release and allow the tool to open, releasing the crimped terminal/wire.,
Now you can poke the crimped terminal/wire/seal assembly into the back side of the WeatherPack housing.

,
Once you've inserted the terminal properly, you will feel it 'click' into place, and it will not pull back out easily due to the retainer tangs.",How to Assemble Weather Pack Connectors,";
, It should fit kind of snug on the wire so it will not try to slip when you crimp it.

, This tool is, as far as we can tell, 100% identical to the actual Delphi tool. In direct comparisons I can't tell a difference. Cheap tools just don't seem to cut it so I wouldn't scrimp here.

, It's also a ratcheting style crimper which helps to make sure you crimp the terminal with the proper amount of force.


Here's another look at the terminal positioning block from the other side of the WeatherPack Crimping Tool. You'll slip the terminals into the hole in this block (in the proper gauge slot), and it helps to maintain the terminal in the correct positioning for a perfect crimp.






Here an 18-20ga female terminal has been positioned in the tool.







, The smaller portion of the seal should be inside the tangs of the terminal. That way once crimped, the tangs grab the seal and hold it tightly.

,,


Here's a view of a properly crimped terminal/seal/wire assembly.






This is a 4 pin Weather Pack Connector 'tower' housing. To help prevent confusion, female terminals are used with 'Tower housings' and and male terminals are used with 'Shroud housings'. Crimping and assembly is the same no matter if you're using a tower or shroud, or a male/female terminal.







,, To remove the terminal that this point you need a Weather Pack Removal tool (included in our larger kits) which makes it very easy to remove the terminals.


In this example we've only inserting one crimped wire/terminal into the housing. The same process is used for the remaining wires/terminals. Once all of the wires/terminals are in place, snap the retaining cover over the rear of the housing.
And here is your finished product.






Here is another view looking down into the housing allowing you to see the visible terminal.






Properly assembled, these Weather Pack Connectors will serve you well. They're manufactured for underhood automotive use, are chemical and weather resistant, and make a solid electrical connection.


We use them all over the place, in race car engine harnesses, streetcar harnesses, adding an electronic box/fan/whatever that we want to be able to quickly disconnect for service/replacement/testing. For example here's an underhood shot of a 2009 Dodge Challenger Drag Pak Stock Eliminator car-- we used Weather Pack Connectors throughout this installation allowing for quick disconnect and/or removal of all components, even the entire engine harness can be disconnected in seconds using the two larger 22pin bulkhead Weather Pack Connectors you can see back on the passenger side of the firewall.

Observe the rise and fall of the car’s engine temperature.The first thing you should do before checking the components of the car’s cooling system is to observe the constant rise and fall of the engine’s temperature.,
Observe the sound of the engine while driving.,
Check for possible leaks.,
Check the cooling system’s sensors.,
Before disconnecting the sensor, allow the engine to cool down.,
Check the thermostat.,
After installing the new one, check if what you have just did helped in fixing the problem.,
Given all of these, it is very important to maintain your car in good running condition.",How to Maintain Your Own Car's Cooling System," You can do this by observing the rate of temperature increase while taking the car on a long drive. In case the engine generates heat faster compared to the previous drives, you can be sure that there must be something wrong with its cooling mechanism and this needs a careful trouble shooting.;
, If there is a whistling noise similar to that of a teakettle, you can also conclude that there is something wrong with your car’s cooling system. This could mean possible leaks and the noise originates from the spot where the pressure escapes.

, As most car advice would recommend, try to check if there are leaks on the car’s engine. You can do this by parking the car in a flat area, check the surface right below it and examine if there are fluids marks on the ground. In case there is a greenish fluid on the ground, you can be sure that there are leaks. Try to open the car’s hood and survey the engine if there are visible fluid deposits in it. If there is, don’t try to open any cover because the pressure is still high. In addition to this, the engine is still hot and this could burn your skin. The best thing that you should do is allow the engine to cool down before checking its components again.

, You also need to check the temperature sensor installed on your car to determine if this functions well. You can do this by parking your car and leave its engine running. Try to observe the rise on the temperature and examine how the sensor reacts to this. In case the gauge shows that the temperature reaches the alarming rate and the radiator fan does not function, this simply means that the sensor malfunctions and this needs to be replaced.

, Disconnect the wires that are attached to the battery to avoid electrocution. Detach the wire that connects the fan to the engine and remove the sensor. Proceed to the nearest auto shop and buy a new one. A sensor usually costs around 15 bucks or less, so try to buy an extra one as a reserve. Install the new sensor as well as all the wires that you have detached. Start the car’s engine and observe whether the changes on the temperature have improved. If the fan kicks-in when the engine needs extra amount of air, you can be sure that you have fixed the problem.

, If the sensor replacement was unable to solve the problem, try to focus your attention on the thermostat. There is a possibility that the thermostat malfunctions and this was the reason behind the car’s sudden temperature problem. Try to fix this by replacing the old thermostat with a new one. Search for its position and remove it carefully. Most of the time, the thermostat is located just below the hose that extends from the engine towards the radiator.

, Start the car’s engine and allow it to run in an idle mode. If there are no improvements, try to check the other components. In case all you did were not able to solve the problem, do not hesitate to take the car to a professional mechanic to have it fixed.

, Proper maintenance could allow you to sell the car in good price and enjoy the profits from it. In case you are having a bad credit record, you can use the amount earned to pay some of your outstanding financial obligations, improve your credit score, and avoid the burden of getting a bad credit vehicle financing that involves higher monthly premiums.

, Elevating the car on ramps may help the process., The heater inlet hose usually runs between the firewall and the top of the radiator. This may be done using a clamp and a couple of screws., Attach a coupler to the flushing tee to prevent backwash.

The black part should attach to the tee and the yellow part should attach to a garden hose. On cars with no radiator cap (or reservoir cap), flush by disconnecting the upper radiator hose.

Check on your repair.",How to Seal a Leaking Radiator," Your radiator dissipates heat to help maintain the optimal operating temperature for your vehicle’s engine. A leak in your radiator will result in lost coolant, which will compromise the system’s ability to reduce that temperature. When your coolant system begins to fail, the temperature gauge on your dash board will climb. If your vehicle has been running consistently warmer or if you have recently begun having issues with overheating, you may have a leak in your radiator.Remember that overheating can cause serious damage to the engine in your vehicle. Stop driving immediately if your vehicle begins to overheat.
If your vehicle has been running hotter than usual, you may have a slow leak, as there is still enough coolant in the system to keep the engine cool enough to operate.;
, An easy way to identify a coolant leak is to notice when puddles of coolant form under your vehicle. Of course, there are a number of fluids in a vehicle’s engine that may leak, so you will need to look closely and possibly even touch the fluid in order to properly identify it. Remember that driving with your air conditioning on will result in moisture dripping from your A/C compressor and that vehicles are just as prone to oil leaks as they may be to coolant ones. If you notice a puddle under your vehicle, or where your vehicle used to be parked, look closely at it.Coolant has a green or orange hue to it and should look quite different from motor oil or water.
New motor oil may be yellowish, but if it’s been in your engine for a while it will likely be dark brown or even black.
Dripped condensation from your air conditioning will just be water.

, If you suspect that you may have a leak in your radiator that you haven’t been able to identify, make note of the coolant level in the coolant reservoir under the hood. Most coolant reservoirs will have low and high fill marks clearly indicated. Draw a line on the reservoir with a paint pen or take a picture of it with your phone to remember the level the fluid is at upon your first inspection. Open the hood and check again after a few hours of driving to see if the level has gone down. If you did the initial check with the engine cold, wait for it to cool again before rechecking.Coolant remains in the sealed system and the level should not change.
If the coolant level is lower upon your second inspection, it means that there is a leak somewhere.

, If you notice more rust and discoloration on the parts surrounding your radiator or on the radiator itself, that may be an indication that there is a coolant leak in the radiator in that vicinity. As the leak permits the coolant and water to escape the radiator while you’re driving, it encourages rust to develop on the parts it comes into contact with. While all engine components can be subject to rusting, if you notice an area with an inordinate amount of it near your radiator, there may be a leak there.Look for signs of coolant around rust spots that you identify.
You may be able to find the leak by following any coolant in these rusty areas to their highest point.

, Your radiator has the important task of helping to maintain the operating temperature of the engine. As a result, the radiator and coinciding lines can become extremely hot. While hot, the coolant system is pressurized, so removing the radiator cap can expel heated coolant and steam that can be dangerous. Pull the car into the space or garage bay that you will be working on it from and allow it to cool for a few hours before beginning this project.Open the hood after you park the vehicle to allow the heat to dissipate unimpeded.
Be prepared to wait for a few hours for your engine to cool enough to work on.

, Because coolant systems are pressurized, it’s important to wear safety glasses when working on your radiator. Although the engine should be cool to the touch before you proceed, coolant systems can be under a great deal of pressure and may expel gas when you open the cap. You also may need to climb under the car at some point during this project and safety glasses will protect your eyes from falling debris that is caught in the vehicle’s undercarriage.Always wear safety glasses when working under the vehicle.
You may also choose to wear gloves to protect your hands from pinches and any remaining heat.

, It will be much easier to locate the leak in your radiator after it’s clean of old grime and coolant. Use a hose to spray the radiator and surrounding components so you can know for sure that any new coolant you see in the engine bay after you start the car has leaked since you washed it. As you wash the radiator, look for any signs of cracks in the radiator itself or on either of its end tanks.It is unnecessary to use soap when washing your radiator.
Use paper towels to wipe away any areas of excessive grime.

, One of the two methods you can use to identify a leak in your radiator is to start the engine once it’s clean. With the engine running, look closely at your radiator and at the surrounding engine for signs of a leak. You may see steam or fluid spraying out of a leak, coolant or water dripping down the radiator or piping, or hear the hissing of a leak that you aren’t able to see from your vantage point. This method can help to point you in the right direction, but may require you to shut the car off again to gain visibility on harder to spot areas of the radiator.Look for fluid or gas spraying from cracks in the radiator.
Look for drops of coolant running downward from a leak above them.
Listen for hissing coming from the area around the radiator for leaks you can’t see.

, You can purchase a coolant system pressure tester at your local auto parts store. To use it, make sure the engine is cool and remove either the radiator or pressure cap from your coolant system. Install the tester in place of the cap using the included adaptor. Once the tester is secured and the system is once again sealed, use the tester to pump ten pounds of pressure into the coolant system. When the gauge indicates a loss of pressure, that means the pressure is currently leaking from the system. Follow the sound of the air leaking from the crack to locate it.Be careful not to add more than 10 to 15 pounds of pressure to your coolant system. More than that could result in damage and even create more leaks.
Look for any leaks that may be present on coolant lines as well as the radiator as they may be susceptible to cracking over time.

, There are a number of products on the market designed to make sealing a leak in your radiator simple and easy. Although there are multiple brands, the methodology of these leak sealant products is fairly universal. Start by ensuring the engine is off and cool. Remove the radiator cap and pour the contents of the leak sealant directly into the cooling system. Top it off with a coolant and water mixture if your vehicle’s engine is currently low. Replace the radiator cap and start the engine. The leak will seal as the sealant makes its way through your coolant system.This method is not as permanent as professional radiator repair or an epoxy, but will suffice to seal small leaks until more permanent repairs can be made.
Allow the engine to run for 5-10 minutes while the stop leak product makes its way through the coolant system.
After running it, allow the engine to sit overnight as the sealant sets.

, When you identify a visible crack, clean the area around it thoroughly. Any remaining grease or dirt in the area may prevent the epoxy from establishing a seal. Use a brake cleaner and a rag to help you remove stuck on grime. Once the area is clean, allow it to dry completely before attempting to use the epoxy. Knead the epoxy in your hand until it becomes malleable enough for you to spread it out over the crack. Remember to be thorough and to keep the epoxy at least an eighth of an inch thick so it can withstand the pressures of the coolant system when the vehicle is running.You can purchase radiator epoxy at most auto parts stores.
Allow the epoxy to set overnight before starting the vehicle.

, Eggs are not a good long term solution, but they can actually seal pinhole leaks in your radiator until you are able to have it properly repaired. Start by separating the egg yolks from the whites. Discard the whites, then put the yolks from three or four eggs into your coolant system through the radiator cap. Start the engine just as you would with a leak sealant and allow the egg yolk to travel through the coolant system. The yolks will congeal and seal small leaks in your radiator and allow it to hold pressure long enough to get you home or to a garage to have repairs done.Using egg yolks could potentially lead to clogs in your coolant lines and is not recommended except in emergencies.
This method is less reliable than the commercial products you can use to permanently repair your radiator.

, Pepper is another unlikely tool you can use to slow or stop a small leak in your radiator long enough to make it home or to a garage for repairs. Wait for the engine to cool completely, then open the radiator cap and pour in about a half a pepper shaker’s worth of common black pepper. The pepper, like sealant or egg yolks, will travel through the coolant system and get caught in the crack as the pressure tries to flush it out. This will create a temporary seal that you can use to hold coolant and pressure long enough to drive for a short time.Like egg yolks, this method is not recommended unless you are in an emergency and is less reliable than commercial products.
Pepper may be able to seal longer cracks than egg yolks, but is only recommended for small leaks.

, Regardless of the method you used to seal the leak in your radiator, it’s important that you check on the repair once you’ve given it an opportunity to set. After driving the vehicle for a short time, keep an eye out for signs of leaking. If you believe you may still be leaking coolant, conduct the same tests to try to identify the source of the leak. There may be multiple leaks or your repair may not have sufficiently sealed the system. Identify any new leaks and repeat the process.


Egg yolks and pepper are not meant to be permanent solutions to a radiator leak. Consider using a leak sealant or epoxy to sure up the repair once you make it home.
Significant cracks may be beyond repair. In those cases, your radiator will likely need to be replaced.
Make sure to refill your coolant system with a 50/50 water and coolant mix any time it is low.

Have you replaced the rotor?

",How to Tune up an Older Car,";
, Mostly these will not be required, though it is best to replace the ignition points.

, If the spark plug leads are not already numbered, use a marker to do so. This can be wiped off later if you like. No.1 cylinder is at the front of the car. With transverse motors No.1 cylinder is nearest the radiator.

,, This prevents damage to the connector. Do not bend the leads sharply as this can wreck the carbon based inner conductor.

,, If the electrodes are severely rounded off or the insulators are damaged, do not re-use.

,, Do not attempt to adjust the centre electrode. Bend the outside one with pliers to open, tap gently on a firm surface to close. A firm sliding fit with the gauge square to the plug shows the correct gap.

, You will see a central shaft with a Bakelite rotor above it. This rotor points to the appropriate contact on the inside of the cap as each spark plug fires. Lift the rotor off, be careful that small parts do not drop off. Wipe the contact areas of the rotor with a coarse rag or one stroke along the edge of a matchbox, no more.

, If there are carbon tracks or cracks, replace the cap. Otherwise wipe clean, remove deposits from the electrodes and set aside.

, Note that one can be used to set the gap, the other holds the points in place. A wire from the outside of the distributor connects to the condenser and the ignition switch.

,, Slight pitting is normal and may be dressed off square with a file. The points may then be re-used.

, This often comes with a new set of points. Wheel bearing grease may be used. Do not use oil, ordinary grease or petroleum jelly as the spinning shaft will throw the lubricant off and it can get between the points.

, Give them a gentle poke with a screwdriver to ensure they have not jammed up. There may be a hole marked ""Oil"" to lubricate them. Two drops of engine oil is enough. Wipe up any oil spillage.

, Put the screws in firmly but do not fully tighten them yet.

, Use a wrench/spanner on the hexagon at the bottom pulley.

, Place in the gap of the points and tighten the points screws. You will almost certainly not get the gap correct the first time so repeat until the gap is correct.

, The rotor cap must be pointing to the position of the No. 1 plug lead. This may take more than one full rotation of the engine as the distributor shaft rotates at half the engine speed.

, This should be shortly before the piston reaches top dead centre. The advance is measured in degrees and is usually around 8 to 15. The bottom pulley may have two marks with a single mark on the motor front. The first of these marks is the correct one, the second corresponds to top dead centre. Match the mark on the pulley with that on the engine.

, Select the correct mark on the engine and match it up with the mark on the pulley. From the front of the engine this will be clockwise of the mark for top dead centre.

, Alternately use the vernier adjustment if fitted.

, Be sure the spark plugs are out of the engine. Switch on the ignition but do not crank the engine.

, With the points open, it will glow brightly.

, Switch off the ignition and tighten the distributor without moving it.

, If the distributor baseplate moves, the vacuum advance is working adequately. Reconnect the tube. If the tube is holed, replace it.

, Burnt-looking connectors indicate loose connections. Replace the lead or take off the connector, clean, cut 2cm or 3/4 inch of lead away and replace the connector. Wipe the leads clean of dirt and oil.

, Carefully thread the spark plugs in, hand tighten then a twitch with a wrench is all that is needed.

, If it does not start, have you replaced the rotor cap?

Assess the depth of the scratch.,
Purchase the correct color touch up paint.,
Clean the area around the scratch.,
Use sandpaper to remove any rust that developed.,
Choose the right conditions to repair it.",How to Touch up Scratches on Your Car1," The proper way to touch up a scratch is best determined by the depth and severity of the scratch. In a well lit area, inspect the scratch. Determine how many layers of paint the scratch has penetrated. If it is just through the clear coat, you may be able to buff it out. If it is down to metal, the process will be different.Look for signs of bare metal or any rust that may have developed on the scratch.
Scratches in the clear coat can be buffed out, whereas scratches through the paint will need new paint applied.;
, Automotive touch up paint comes in a wide variety of colors, so the best way to find the right replacement paint is to look for the paint code in your car’s owner’s manual. Once you have the paint code, you can purchase touch up paint with the identical code and rest assured that they will match.Heavily faded vehicle’s may not match with their original paint code, but this shouldn’t be an issue for small touch ups.
You may also be able to find your car’s paint code inside the driver’s door on the same panel as the VIN number.

, Use automotive soap and clean water to wash the scratch and the area immediately surrounding it. Make sure there is no debris or dirt stuck to the scratch. Once done, rinse the area thoroughly.Use a hose to rinse the entire area and ensure there is no dirt or debris stuck to the car’s paint.
Dry the area completely using a towel, or just wait for it to dry.

, Use 120 grit sandpaper to sand away any rust that has developed on the paint or metal. Be extremely careful with where you use the sand paper to avoid damaging the surrounding paint unnecessarily.Remove all rust from the metal before repairing a scratch, otherwise the rust will continue to spread beneath the touch up paint.
If the rust has penetrated the metal, that panel will need to be professionally repaired or replaced.

, It is best not to touch up scratches while working in direct sunlight. Instead, find a shady area to work on the vehicle, or choose an overcast day. The shade will allow you to choose how to light the area to best identify and repair the scratches, as well as keeping things like soap from drying on the paint.Allowing soap to dry on the paint will dull its finish and possibly damage the paint.
Direct sunlight could make the metal on the car hot, which isn’t optimal for applying touch up paint.

"
"
Apply automotive primer to any bare metal.,
Add a coat of paint to the scratch.,
Put a layer of clear coat of the dry paint.,
Use rubbing compound to make the area shine.,
Wash and wax the car.",How to Touch up Scratches on Your Car2," If the scratch has penetrated all the layers of paint down to bare metal, it’s important to add a layer of primer. The primer will prevent rust from developing beneath the surface of the paint, as well as providing a good surface to apply the touch up paint to.Use a small brush to apply a thin layer of primer to any exposed paint.
Be sure to apply the primer to any metal you sanded rust off of.

, Allow the primer to dry completely. Then, take your automotive paint and apply a layer of it over the area you painted with primer. If the scratch is fairly small, try dabbing the paint onto the scratch and allowing it to spread and settle on its own.Dabbing the paint often yields the flattest finished product. A toothpick may work for thinner scratches.
Most automotive touch up paints will not require multiple layers.

, Once the primer and the touch up paint have both dried, you may want to add a layer of clear coat. Because most clear coat comes in a spray can, it’s important that you take steps to prevent over-spray, or accidentally applying clear coat to areas you didn’t intend to. To prevent this, cut a hole through a piece of cardboard and hold it between the can of clear coat and the scratch, then use the cardboard to help direct the flow of the clear coat spray.Unlike a nozzle, the hole in the cardboard will allow the clear coat to mist onto the surface of the paint, rather than striking it as a jet and dripping.
Immediately dab up any dripping clear coat with a clean rag.

, Ensure the clear coat is completely dry, then apply some polishing compound to the area. Use a polishing wheel to polish the paint with the compound, in order to ensure it appears uniform with the rest of the car’s body.The rubbing compound will remove any small gaps in the paint and create a more professional finish.
Stop polishing the area when the shiny paint is revealed by the polishing wheel.

, Rinse the car, then use a bucket of water mixed with automotive soap to wash the entire car. Once done, rinse and dry it, and apply a layer of automotive wax to the entire vehicle so there is a uniform shine to all of the paint.The polishing process can remove some of the protective clear coat over your paint, so applying wax adds a layer of protection for your paint.

"
"
Clean any dirt away from the scratch.,
Buff the sanded area with scratch remover.,
Clean away any excess scratch remover compound.,
Wash and wax the vehicle.",How to Touch up Scratches on Your Car3," Scratches in the clear coat can be repaired without adding any additional paint. Before you can get started, wash and dry the area around the scratch to make sure there’s no dirt or debris that could result in new scratches during the repair process.Bits of dirt could cause additional scratches in the clear coat as you buff the scratch out.
Make sure the paint is dry if the scratch remover you purchased requires dry paint.

, Apply a small amount of scratch removing compound to a buffing pad and apply it to the scratched area in a circular motion. Continue to rub the compound into the scratch firmly until the compound is dry.Read the instructions on the scratch remover your purchase, as some will have variations in their application methods.
You can purchase scratch remover at your local auto parts store.

, Once done, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess scratch remover compound that remains on the paint. There will likely be a build of the compound around the outside edges of the portion you treated.Make sure you to wipe the compound away completely.

, Fill a bucket with water and a small amount of automotive soap. Then rinse entire vehicle paying close attention to the area you just repaired. Wash the entire car thoroughly, then wax the car. Waxing the entire car will ensure an even finish to the paint.Once the wax is dry, buff it off with a microfiber towel.
The repaired scratch should be invisible once the wax is buffed off.

Ensure your car has non-electric, upright locks.,
Call a locksmith if you’re still unsure.,
Approach the car’s passenger side door.,
Insert a wedge between the car window and weather stripping.,
Slide the slim jim in the space made by the wedge.,
Watch the lock for subtle movement.,
Pull the slim jim upwards slowly until the door unlocks.,
Avoid making multiple attempts to open the door.",How to Use a Slim Jim," These locks look like small cylinders and are found near the bottom of the car window, where it meets the door. Note that these locks are usually found on cars manufactured in 1992 or before. If your car was made afterwards, it might still have these locks, but the car door may have electronics, wires or even airbags that make using a slim jim more difficult.If you’re unsure what locks are on your car, you should consult the user’s manual, or try researching your car model online.;
, If it’s not obvious whether your car has the right locks for a slim jim, you should strongly consider calling a locksmith. Using a slim jim on the wrong type of locks could seriously damage your car. A locksmith might seem expensive, but the repairs on your car could be moreso.








, It seems natural to want to open the driver’s side door; after all this is where you typically enter the car. However, professional locksmiths typically try opening the passenger side door.That way, if you make a mistake and damage the door’s mechanism, it won’t be the door you use most.








, The weatherstrip is the rubber strip running between the car door and window.This will create the space you need to insert the slim jim. You can get a wedge specifically designed for opening car locks, but they’re typically not much different than a door wedge. Ideally, use a rubber wedge, as a wooden wedge could leave splinters and shards in your car door.








, Slide the notched end first, in towards the car lock. Align the slim jim with the lock, pushing down towards the keyhole, which is usually located at the rear of the door. Make sure to insert the slim jim slowly, making sure not to catch on anything on the way down.








, You’ll know the slim jim has caught on the locking mechanism if the lock starts moving slightly. Make sure to keep the slim jim completely vertical, to avoid catching on any other mechanisms.








, If you’ve latched onto the locking mechanism, the lock should move upwards as you move the slim jim. Keep your motion slow and smooth to avoid causing any undue damage. Remove the slim jim and you’ll be able to open the car door.








, If you can’t get the door unlocked after one or two attempts, it’s best to stop before you cause any damage to it. Unlocking a locked door is a very technical skill; don’t feel bad if you’re not able to get it open. Get a professional to open your car door and call a locksmith.

Disconnect the battery.,
Loosen the bolts attaching the alternator to the bracket.,
Use a piece of wood as a pry bar to increase the tension on the belt.,
Tighten the alternator bolts in the new location.,
Check the belt tension.,
Reconnect the battery.",How to Tighten a Drive Belt1," Before you get started, disconnect the battery to ensure the engine cannot be started while you’re working under the hood. As a precaution, always disconnect the battery before putting your hands in the engine bay of your vehicle. Use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut holding the ground cable on the negative terminal of the battery, then slide it off the terminal post. You will not need to disconnect the positive cable as well.Locate the negative terminal by following the black ground cable, or looking for the negative symbol (-) or the letters NEG.
Tuck the cable along the side of the battery to ensure it can’t accidentally come into contact with the negative terminal.;
, Many alternators are bolted to a bracket with a long slotted metal strap that allows you to adjust the angle of the alternator in relation to the engine. By loosening the bolts, you will be able to adjust the alternator’s angle to increase or decrease tension on the drive belt.Loosen the two bolts going through the slot on the alternator bracket, but do not remove them.
Make sure the bolts are loose enough to allow the alternator to slide within the bracket.

, With the alternator bolts loosened, you will need to place a good deal of pressure on the alternator in order to make sure the drive belt is tight enough. The easiest way to do this is to use a piece of wood as a pry bar. Using wood reduces the likelihood of placing too much force on the alternator as one might with a crowbar, but one can be used carefully. The handle of a hammer tends to work well in most circumstances. Slide the piece of wood between the alternator and the engine, then pull back on the wood, increasing the tension in the drive belt as the alternator slides within the bracket loop.Place enough force on the pry bar to pull the drive belt until it is tight over the alternator pulley.
Choose the area of the engine you pry against carefully to ensure you do not crush any coolant lines or electrical connections.

, With the alternator pried back and the drive belt tight, use your free hand to tighten the alternator bolts in their new position in the slot on the bracket. Once the bolts are tight enough, you should be able to release the wood you were using to pry the alternator away from the motor, leaving the alternator in its new position.Make sure the bolts are tight before releasing the pry bar; otherwise the tension of the belt will pull the alternator back to its previous position.
This step may be easier if you enlist a friend to help you.

, With the alternator in its new position, applying increased tension to the drive belt, check to make sure the belt is tight enough to run the accessories properly. An easy way to test the tension of the drive belt is to hold a ruler along a stretch of the belt, then use your thumb and index finger to try to pull the midpoint of the belt away from the ruler. If you can pull the belt more than a half inch from the ruler, it is not tight enough.You can also purchase belt tension testers at many auto parts stores that will tell you whether or not the belt is tight enough.
If the belt is not tight enough, loosen the alternator bolts and try again.

, Once the belt has enough tension, you can reconnect the battery using the same hand or socket wrench you used to disconnect it. With the battery reconnected, the vehicle is ready to drive.Make sure the ground cable is attached securely to the negative terminal as it will cause the vehicle to die if it comes loose.

Loosen the alternator bolts or the tensioner pulley.,
Slide the old belt off of the pulleys.,
Compare the replacement belt to the new one.,
Run the new belt through all of the necessary pulleys.,
Increase tension on the new belt.",How to Tighten a Drive Belt2," A loose drive belt may be the result of stretching over time. If your drive belt has stretched, it should be replaced. Depending on the vehicle, there are a number of ways you may be able to loosen the tension on the drive belt. A tensioner pulley can be loosened by inserting a breaker bar or socket wrench into the hole in the center of the pulley and twisting it clockwise. In other vehicles, you will need to loosen the alternator bolts and either tip it forward or slide it toward the motor within its bracket to loosen the belt.Check the service manual for your vehicle to determine which way you can reduce the tension on your drive belt.
If your belt has been damage or is showing signs of excessive wear, it should be replaced instead of simply tightened.

, With the tension off of the belt, slide it off the top pulley. This will produce enough slack to remove it from all of the remaining ones. If your vehicle does not provide a diagram of how the drive belt is wound through the pulleys, take a picture of it before removing the belt to ensure you can place the new one on in the same fashion.The drive belt likely snakes through a number of pulleys in order to power multiple accessories within your car.
You may also be able to find a diagram of the drive belt’s route on the auto maker’s website.

, Before installing a new drive belt, compare it to the old one to make sure you’ve purchased the right belt. While an old belt may stretch a bit, they should be fairly close in length and equal in width. Make sure the new belt matches the old so it will install properly.The wrong belt could fail to power the vehicle’s accessories or even cause internal damage to the engine.
If you feel you have purchased the wrong belt, return it to the auto parts store and get the proper belt before moving forward.

, Follow the diagram or picture you took to run the new drive belt back through and around all of the pulleys the old one did. If your vehicle comes equipped with a tensioner pulley, turn it clockwise again to bring it closer to the other pulleys as you slide the belt over it last.Check the belt against the diagram or picture again once you’ve finished running it to ensure it looks right.
You will need to maintain pressure on the tensioner pulley while getting the belt over it, so this step may be easier with a friend to help.

, Once the belt has been run through all the necessary pulleys, either release the tensioner or use a piece of wood to pry the alternator away from the motor to increase the tension in the belt. With the belt tight, bolt the alternator in place to maintain tension.Use a ruler to check to make sure the belt is under the proper amount of tension.
Place the ruler along the belt and try to pull the middle of it away from the ruler. If it moves more than a half inch, it’s not tight enough.

Loosen the tension on the belt.,
Slide the belt off of the pulleys.,
Remove the bolt holding the tensioner into place.,
Insert the new tensioner, aligning the locking pin on the back.,
Run the new drive belt through all of the necessary pulleys.",How to Tighten a Drive Belt3," If the belt is intact and your vehicle comes equipped with a tensioner pulley, you may not be able to tighten the belt without replacing the tensioner. Most tensioners are installed using only one bolt. Start by inserting a half inch drive breaker bar or ratchet into the hole in the center of the pulley. Twist the breaker bar clockwise to reduce the tension in the belt.This may not be particularly difficult if your tensioner has broken.
You may also consider replacing the drive belt while doing this, as it will have to come off anyway.

, Slide the belt off of the tensioner pulley first, then release the tensioner. You may choose to leave the belt where it is to avoid having to run it back through all of the pulleys, but you may also want to remove it if it is in the way of where you will be working.Take note of how the belt is run through all of the pulleys if your vehicle and owner’s manual does not have a diagram to follow.
If you do not have a diagram, try taking a picture of the belt with your phone to use as a guide.

, There will be one bolt holding the tensioner in place that passes through the tensioner into the engine block or a bracket attached to it. Use a hand or socket wrench to remove the bolt. Note the position of the locking pin sticking out of the back of the tensioner as you remove it.The locking pin provides the tensioner with leverage to exert force onto the belt.
You will need to re-use the bolt you remove from the old tensioner when installing the new one.

, Slide the new tensioner into place, paying attention to slide the locking pin into the engine block in the same fashion the old one was when you removed it. Insert the bolt and tighten it using the same wrench you used to remove the old one.Make sure to make it tight, as there will be a good amount of force on the tensioner when the vehicle is running.
The tensioner will likely not seat properly without the pin inserted in the right place, so if you are having trouble getting it in, check to ensure the pin is sliding into the hole in the block or bracket.

, Run the drive belt back through and around all of the pulleys. Use a diagram or the picture you took of them to ensure you run the belt properly. Slide a breaker bar or half inch drive ratchet into the hole in the center of the new tensioner pulley and turn it clockwise to lower it as you slip the drive belt over the tensioner pulley last. The new tensioner should hold the belt at the proper level of tension once you release it.Test the tension of the belt by placing a ruler alongside it and pulling the belt away from it. If the belt will come further than a half inch away from the ruler, it is still not tight enough.

Check the tension of the drive belt.,
Watch your voltage gauge.,
Take note of overheating issues.,
Check the voltage reaching the battery.,
Look for signs of wear or damage on the drive belt.,
Check the tensioner pulley.",How to Tighten a Drive Belt4," If you can see any visible sag in your drive belt, it is far too loose, but tension issues are not always visible. Pinch the belt between your thumb and index fingers and try to wiggle it from top to bottom. If the belt moves more than a half of an inch or so, it is too loose and needs to be tightened or replaced.You can purchase belt tensioner tools that will measure the tension of the drive belt and let you know if it is too loose at most auto parts stores.
If the belt seems loose, it likely requires tightening or replacing.

, A loose drive belt cannot power the accessories as well as it is supposed to. The alternator in your vehicle is powered by the drive belt, so if you notice dimming interior lights or your voltage gauge fluctuating, there may be an issue with the drive belt.Dimming interior lights and issues with your electrical gauge can both also mean an issue with your alternator.
If the lights get brighter when you accelerate, the problem may be the alternator rather than the belt.

, Another common issue caused by a loose drive belt is overheating. The drive belt powers the water pump in your vehicle that runs coolant throughout the engine. If the belt is too loose, it may not be able to sufficiently power the pump, resulting in higher operating temperatures and even overheating.Engine heat issues may also be caused by bad coolant, a leak in your coolant system, or a faulty water pump.
Be careful driving a vehicle with coolant issues, as overheating an engine can cause significant internal damage.

, If your vehicle does not come equipped with a voltage gauge, you can check the voltage reaching the battery using a voltmeter. Voltmeters can be purchased at most auto parts or large retail stores and can tell you how many volts are traveling through an electrical system. Touch the black sensor coming from the voltmeter to the negative terminal on the battery and the other to the positive, then check to see how many volts are flowing through the system. If the alternator is generating enough voltage, it should read between 13.8 and 15.3 volts.The black lead from the voltmeter connects to the negative terminal on the battery. You can find the negative terminal by looking for the letters “NEG” or the negative symbol that looks like (-).
The red lead from the voltmeter connects to the positive terminal, which can be identified by the letters “POS” or the positive symbol that looks like (+).

, Even if you haven’t had electrical or coolant issues, your drive belt may still need to be replaced if there are signs of extensive wear or damage anywhere on the belt. Look for cracks that develop along the ribs of the belt, chunks missing, or frayed fabric on the top back of the belt.Even under optimal conditions, drive belts will eventually wear out and begin to stretch.
Look for any indications that something has been rubbing on the drive belt and make sure to address it before installing a new one.

, Many modern vehicles come equipped with a tensioner pulley that places tension on the belt. Use your vehicle’s service manual to locate the tensioner pulley and try to move it around with your hand. The tensioner is designed to withstand more force that you should be able to easily place on it with your bare hands, so if it moves, it has likely gone bad.If you can see the tensioner pulley with the motor running, start it and watch for any movement in the pulley.
The tensioner pulley should not move under the pressure of the belt when in motion.

Locate the interior fuse box.,
Find the fuse labeled “Door Jam Defeat.” Look on the underside of the fuse box cover for a diagram of the fuses inside the box.,
Remove the fuse.,
Reconnect the battery.",How to Take Jeep Doors Off," The side mirrors on your Jeep are attached to the door and are designed to be folded in flat. Press the mirror in toward the door and adjust it so the mirror itself rests flat against the door.Folding the mirrors in will prevent them from being damaged when you store the doors.
To fold the mirrors, simply press them in toward the door.;
, You will need to be able to pull the door up and off of the vehicle, and being able to reach through the open window will make that much easier. Storing the door with the window inside the body will also protect it from being broken by accident.Turn the window crank counter-clockwise to lower the window.
It is possible to remove the doors if your windows won’t go down.

, There is a black safety strap connected to each door designed to prevent the door from opening too far. To disconnect the strap, simply unhook it from the body of Jeep. The other end will stay connected to the door itself.The safety strap usually keeps the door from opening up into the body of the Jeep.

, If your Jeep came equipped with power windows and door locks, there will be a group of wires bunched in black cloth going from the door to where they connect beneath the dashboard. Press the release on the plastic wire pigtail and pull it backward to disconnect the wiring.If your Jeep does not have power windows or door locks, you can skip this step.
Be careful not to break the plastic clip that holds the wiring pigtail in place.

, On the outside of the vehicle, there are two bolts that hold each door in place. Close the door without latching it so you can adjust how open you keep the door to best access the nuts holding the bolts in place.The bolts can be found where the door meets the body of the vehicle.
The bolts themselves serve as a part of the door hinge.

, At the bottom of each of the two bolts that hold each door on the vehicle, there are nuts that must be removed in order to take the doors off of your Jeep. Use a 13 millimeter socket and wrench to remove these nuts.Use a six point socket rather than a twelve point socket to minimize how much the nut can move inside the socket.
Turn the nuts counter-clockwise to loosen them.

, The nuts are painted to match the body of the Jeep, so be very careful not to damage the paint as you unscrew them. Damaging the paint will not only stand out, but could lead to rusting. Scraped or scratched off paint can be repaired using automotive touch up paint.
Using a six point socket will reduce the chances of damaging the paint on the nuts.

, With the nuts removed, reach through the open window to gain a good grip on the door handles on both the inside and outside. Pull the door straight up to pull the bolts that are attached to the door out of the brackets that hold them in place.If you can’t roll down the window, grip the outside edges of either side of the door to pull it up.
Be careful not to pinch your fingers in the gap between the door and the body before removing it.

, You will need to store the doors someplace safe. For the time being, lay a blanket or soft material on the floor. If you intend to leave the doors off of your Jeep for an extended period of time, you can wrap the blanket around them to serve as extra protection.For the time being, the blanket will protect the door’s surfaces from abrasion.

, Set each door down on the blanket with the painted external surface facing up. You may also lean the door up against a vertical surface, but be sure to place the blanket beneath the door’s edge to avoid chipping the paint.It is recommended that you hang a blanket over the doors as well if you store them standing up.
Be sure to place the doors someplace where they will not be disturbed or knocked over.

, Once you have the first door removed and set aside, repeat the entire process on the other side to remove the remaining door. Store both doors someplace safe and out of the way.Make sure to keep the nuts you remove from the door hardware someplace safe for when you choose to reinstall the doors.

, Before starting any electrical project, no matter the size, you should always disconnect the battery. Use the appropriate sized wrench to loosen the nut holding the black cable on the negative terminal on the battery.Tuck the cable to the side of the battery to prevent it from coming into contact with the negative terminal.
You do not need to disconnect the positive cable.

, The fuse box in the interior of a Jeep Wrangler is located near the emergency brake. Once you find it, remove the cover over the fuse box by pulling it backward toward yourself.If you have trouble finding the fuse box, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for directions.
Set the fuse box cover someplace safe to ensure it doesn’t get damaged.

, If there isn’t one there, check inside the Jeep’s owner’s manual. Once you find the diagram, look for the fuse labeled “Door Jam Defeat.”If you do not have an owner’s manual, you can look it up on the automaker’s website.

, Use fuse clips or a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the “Door Jam Defeat” fuse from the fuse box. With this fuse removed, the dome light and the door ajar alarm will both stay off when you reconnect the battery.Place the fuse someplace safe to ensure you can put it back in once you reinstall the doors.

, With the fuse removed, reconnect the black cable to the negative terminal on the battery and use the same wrench to tighten the nut securing it again. Be sure the cable has a solid metal on metal connection before closing the hood.With the battery reconnected, start the Jeep and ensure the door ajar alarm doesn’t sound.
The dome light should remain off until you return the fuse.

You may wish you had them in the car if someone asks when you last rotated the tires, changed the oil or transmission fluid, or flushed the radiator. Keep these receipts in the car.

, Under inflated tires cause many accidents. An under inflated tire can be torn off the rim when cornering hard causing a serious crash.

, Check the owners manual for guidance. It is recommended to change the oil every 3,000 miles (4,800 km).

, Dirty oil and dirty air filters will allow dirt into the engine and scar the inside of the engine making wear out much faster and cause early and very expensive engine failure.

, This means having the wheels taken off and put back on in different locations such as moving the front tires to the back and vice versa. This helps the tires wear more evenly and last sometimes twice as long.

, Seasonal temperature swings can change the pressure in tires even if there is no leak.

, Brake shoes eventually wear out just like the soles of your walking shoes. When they wear all the way through it can cause damage to the brake rotor that can be expensive to fix. Even though they stop the car effectively the shoes could be very thin and start damaging the brakes any time so check them visually when rotating your tires.

, These are easy to check on most cars by opening the engine compartment:

, Spray them with glass cleaner and let sit for at least 5 minutes.

, The process that you use will depend upon if you have leather or synthetic interiors.


Buy car cleaning wipes for plastic molded interiors. These will make the job go faster than using a spray with soap and water. Wipe clean the dashboard, console, steering wheel, gear shift and molding throughout the interior of the car.
Buy leather cleaner for leather interiors. Spray the leather cleaner onto a terry cloth or other lint free fabric. Rub the surfaces of the leather well, but not too hard. Most leather is dyed and rough cleaning can remove some dye.
Clean especially dirty leather with leather cleaner and a toothbrush. Pour some leather cleaner on a soft bristled toothbrush. Brush in a circular motion and then wipe clean.
Wrap a car cleaning wipe around a flat-nosed screwdriver. Clean around the buttons, dials and vents with this tool.

, Take your time with this step.

, Place the seats in a reclined position so that you can vacuum between the seams. You can use a shop vacuum or you can go to a car wash and pay for time with an industrial strength vacuum.

, Hang them and beat them with a racket to remove hidden dust and dirt.

, Remove blood or bright stains with cold water. Try to treat the stain immediately to avoid discoloration.

, Sponge the mixture on lightly. Allow it to sit for 20 minutes and then rub clean. Dry with a hair dryer if too much water soaks into the flooring or upholstery.

, You can also make a homemade cleaner by mixing 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water with 1/2 cup (118 ml) vinegar and 1 oz. (30 ml) of dish soap. Mix well. Apply with a hard bristled brush. Let it sit for 30 minutes and dry by blotting with towels. Use a hair dryer on any soaked areas of upholstery.

, Use a damp sponge to mop the mixture onto the carpet. Blot out excess moisture with dry towels.


Do not use this mixture on wool carpeting. Check in your driver's manual to see if you have wool carpet.

, Buy liquid resin from a craft store. Paint the liquid resin onto the edges and the seams to stop the fraying and lay the worn edges down.

, Leave the Borax on the carpeting for 1 hour and then vacuum it up. This is essential for a car that often carries around pets.

, Suck up all the excess water and open the car doors to make sure it dries completely before using the car. Use a hair dryer to get rid of excess moisture.

, This will make them easier to clean.

, Remove the objects first, and then place a damp towel over the indentations. Heat an iron on a low setting, and place it over the towel.


As the towel dries, it will lift up the indentation. Make sure not to hold the iron in 1 place for too long.

, Allow it to dry according to package directions. This will make your upholstery easier to clean in the future.

Check to make sure you are using the proper fuel.,
Add an octane booster.,
Buy the right gas.",How to Stop a Car from Knocking1," In order for the fuel to ignite at the proper time during the combustion cycle, you have to use at least the recommended minimum octane level. In the US this, is usually 87, but there are some higher end performance cars that require higher.Check your owner’s manual if you are unsure what octane rating your car uses.;
, If you discover that you have been using the wrong fuel, you can add an octane booster to your tank. It doesn’t matter much which brand you choose as they are designed to simply increase the octane level of your fuel, allowing you to use the gas in your tank.Adding the booster is quite simple ― you just pour it into your gas tank.

, Using an octane booster to get through your last tank of low octane fuel is fine, but from now, on you want to buy the right kind of fuel. You should also keep in mind that whatever low octane fuel is left in your tank when you fill up will mix with your new fuel, so if knocking continues, go ahead and use the octane booster for another fill-up or two until most of the low octane fuel is gone.


It is also thought that using a ""top-tier"" gasoline such as Shell or Chevron will decrease engine deposits that can cause knocking."

Locate the headlight controls.,
Look at the “off” position.,
Turn the switch to the correct symbol.,
Consider checking the results.,
Know when to use your headlights.,
Look for the basic headlight indicator symbol.,
Identify the indicator symbol for each setting.,
Watch for warning symbols on the dashboard.",How to Turn on Headlights," Headlight controls are not located in the same place in each vehicle, but there are a few spots that are commonly used. Look for either a control panel or a control arm near the steering wheel.


Some manufacturers place a separate headlight control panel just beneath the dashboard, just to the driver's left side. These panels are especially common in larger vehicles with a greater amount of dashboard space. Look for a small panel with a dial on it. The standard headlight indicator symbols should be positioned at various intervals around the dial.
Other manufacturers place the headlight controls on a control arm attached to the base of the steering wheel. The arm can be positioned to the left or right of the steering wheel, and a headlight control dial will be located toward the end of the arm. This headlight control dial will be marked with the standard headlight indicator symbols.;
, By default, the headlight controls will be switched to an “off” position. Note which symbol marks that position and where it lies along the dial so that you can turn the headlights off when you are finished.


The “off” position is usually located to the far left or underside of the dial. It is typically marked by an open or empty circle.
Nowadays, many vehicles are equipped with “running lights” that automatically come on when your vehicle is on and your headlights are off. If your headlights appear to be off but you still see lights shining from the front of your vehicle, those lights are probably running lights.
Always make sure that the headlights are off when you turn off your car. Keeping the headlights on while the vehicle is off can drain the automobile's battery, and the car will not turn on later if the battery is drained dry. If you forget and do completely drain the battery, you will need to jump start your car to get it going again.

, Grab the control dial between your thumb and index finger and rotate it until it reaches the appropriate setting. The different settings are indicated by separate symbols, and you should feel the dial “click” into place as it passes into each setting.


The parking lights are the first setting on most cars. These lights are be orange in color on the front and red on the rear of the vehicle.
The ""low beam"" or ""dipped beam"" setting is usually the next setting. These headlamps provide forward and lateral light while minimizing glare, so they should be used on crowded roads when other vehicles are less than 65 yards (60 meters) ahead of you.The ""fog lights"" may also be positioned on this dial, but some car manufacturers place the fog light control on a separate button located directly next to the standard headlight controls. Fog lights use a wide, downward pointing light to illuminate the road. They should be used during poor visibility conditions, like fog, rain, snow, and dust.
The ""main beam,"" ""high beam,"" or ""brights"" are not found on the low beam control. This setting is usually on a stick on the steering column, sometimes the stick that controls your turn signal, and is always separate from the low beam control. The high beams can be turned on by pushing or pulling on the turn signal lever forwards or backwards. These lights are more intense and create a greater amount of road glare, so you should only use them when other cars are not present or nearby.

, When in doubt, check the way your automobile headlights react when you turn the control dial to each position.


If you have someone who can help you, ask that individual to stand outside and in front of your vehicle while it is parked. Roll your window down so that you can communicate with your helper, then rotate the headlight control dial to each position. Pause at each position and ask your helper to identify the setting.
If you do not have someone to help you, park your vehicle in front of a garage, wall, or similar structure. Rotate the headlight control dial to each position, pausing long enough after each setting to look at how the light shines on the surface. You should be able to determine which setting is which based on how bright the lights reflect.

, You should use your headlights whenever visibility is low. If you are unable to see 500 to 1000 feet (150 to 305 meters) ahead of you, your headlights must go on.Always use your headlights at night. Use the low beams when other vehicles are nearby and your high beams in other conditions.
Use your headlights at dawn and dusk, too. Even though some sunlight is present, deep shadows from buildings and other structures can make it difficult to see other vehicles. You should at least use your low beams during these hours of the day.
Use your fog lights during bad weather such as rain, snow, fog, or dust storms. Do not use your high beams since the reflection and glare they produce in these conditions can actually make it harder for other drivers to see clearly.

, Most headlight controls will be marked by a standard headlamp indicator symbol. Look for this symbol on the side of the control dial.


The standard headlamp indicator symbol looks like a sun or upside-down light bulb.
On many headlight control dials, there will also be an enclosed circle next to this indicator symbol. The circle marks the side of the dial actually controlling the headlight settings. Align this enclosed circle with the headlight setting you wish to select.

, Each headlight setting should be labeled by a separate symbol, and these symbols are almost always the same from vehicle to vehicle.


If your vehicle is equipped with parking lamps, these lights should be indicated by a symbol that looks like the letter ""p"" with several lines extending out from the rounded front.
The ""low beam"" symbol looks like a rounded triangle or capital letter ""D."" Downward-slanted lines extend out from the flat side of the shape.
The ""fog light"" symbol utilizes the same shape and has downward slanting lines like the ""low beam"" symbol. One wavy line should pass directly through the center of these slanted lines, though.
The ""high beam"" symbol also looks like a rounded triangle or capital ""D,"" but the lines extending out from the flat side are perfectly horizontal., Automobiles with electronic/digital dashboards may display a warning light when certain car lights are not operating correctly. When one of these warning lights flashes, you should have the corresponding headlight changed or otherwise fixed.


When your headlights are malfunctioning, your vehicle may display the standard headlight indicator symbol with an exclamation mark (!) or ""x"" across it.
Alternatively, it may display the low beam indicator with an exclamation mark over it.

Push the horn several times.,
Disconnect the car battery.,
Disconnect the fuse connected to the horn.,
Remove the horn relay.,
Disconnect the horn itself.,
Look for moisture that could be causing a fault.,
Install an auxiliary horn button.,
Have an experienced mechanic remove the airbag.,
Dry out water in the steering column.,
Replace the switch or clock spring.",How to Shut Off a Jammed Horn," Pushing on your steering wheel a few times may dislodge a stuck switch in the horn's assembly.You can also try twisting your steering wheel back and forth a few times.;
, This will silence the horn, and if you're lucky it may reset the horn and solve the problem (although there may be an underlying issues that causes it to recur).It's also a good idea to disconnect the battery before trying the steps below, to reduce the danger of electric shock or short circuits. Follow these steps to disconnect the battery safely:Turn off the engine. (Leave it off for the steps below as well.)
Wear insulated gloves and safety goggles. Remove all metal jewelry.
Find a socket wrench that fits the terminal (typically ⅜ inches).
Disconnect the negative terminal first. This typically has a - symbol and is connected to a black wire. Use caution to avoid creating a short with the wrench or wire.
Disconnect the positive terminal.

, Check your car's manual to find out where the fuse box is located. The fuse box cover or the manual should have a diagram that tells you which fuse is part of the horn's wiring. Turn off the ignition, then pry the fuse out by hand or with fuse pullers.


If you do not have your car manual, search online for your make and model, followed by ""manual"" or ""fuse diagram.""
The fuse box is usually located under the driver's side dash, in the driver's side doorjamb, or in the glovebox.Many cars have a second fuse box in the engine compartment.
Some models, especially older ones, run several electrical components on the same fuse as the horn. Inspect the fuse diagram so you know what else will be affected.

, Most cars have a horn relay, which feeds extra current into your horn. This is usually a cube with a diagram on the side, plugged into a slot in the under-hood fuse box.An inoperative relay typically stops your horn from working, but it is possible for it to jam the horn in an on position.Even if the relay is not the problem, removing it should disable the horn.


Refer to the wiring schematic on the fuse box lid or in your owner's manual to identify the correct relay.
If your horn sounds different than usual or you do not hear the usual clicking sound when you press it, the relay is likely shorted. Replace it and try to discover the cause of the short, such as a damaged wire or water in the fuse box.

, If your car has no relay and the horn's fuse is on the same circuit as other important components, remove the horn itself. This is located under the hood, usually behind the front grille or attached to the firewall behind the engine.The horn is typically shaped like a loudspeaker or a toroid (doughnut). Disconnect the wires leading to the horn. Cover the exposed wires with electrical connectors or electrical tape to prevent a short if you plan on driving the car to an auto repair shop.


Many cars have two horns, but these are usually attached to the same unit. Refer to your owner's manual wiring schematic if you are having trouble locating the horns.
The battery must be disconnected while removing this part.
Remove all jewelry and dangling clothing before reaching below the hood.

, This may happen after a severe rainstorm, or if your car has been power washed under the hood by yourself or your dealer. If you see any moisture in the fuse box, disconnect the battery and leave the car to dry out. Severe water buildup or corrosion may require a mechanic to repair., If the switch inside your steering column is jammed, one solution is to install an auxiliary horn that bypasses this switch, available from any auto parts store. Check your owner's manual to make sure you wire it to the 12v line that powers your horn. This is best used as a temporary fix until you can get the faulty part replaced.

, The remaining solutions involve the steering column, which also contains an airbag in most cars. If you do not properly deactivate and remove the airbag, it may deploy with extreme force. Some cars have a backup battery for the airbag which may allow it to deploy even when the main battery is disconnected. Do not to try this yourself unless you are confident you have the expertise to disable it safely, and you have an owner's manual to guide you.Always disconnect the battery first and wait at least thirty minutes for the power to drain from the airbag system.

, If there is any corrosion or moisture inside the steering column, water could be shorting your system and causing the stuck horn. Try drying it with an air compressor, and spraying damp parts with an electrical cleaner. Reassemble the steering column once it is dry, and the horn may work again.

, If the electrical parts are all functional, the horn switch under the steering wheel may be jammed. Another possibility is a broken clock spring: the coil that winds and unwinds as you turn the wheel to maintain the electrical connection. The clock spring is especially likely to be the problem if your airbag warning light is on, or if you have noticed other issues with electrical components on your steering column.You may wish to have a mechanic install the clock spring.

Consider cleaning your cylinders.,
Use a fuel additive.,
Flush your engine.,
Test your car.",How to Stop a Car from Knocking2," Again, using the wrong fuel can be an issue. Not only can it cause knocking by igniting at the wrong time, it can also leave excess contaminants in your cylinders as a result of poor combustion.If you are now using the proper fuel, you may need to clean out the contaminants left by past fuels.

, While most fuels have a specified amount of detergent in them (at least in the US), this may not always be enough to keep your combustion chamber clean. Using top tier gasoline brands will provide more detergents that help keep your engine clean.Another way to clean your cylinders is to add a detergent to your fuel. This is as easy as buying a fuel additive at your local parts store and pouring it into your gas tank at your next fill up.This step is very simple. Just choose an additive and follow the directions on the bottle for putting it in your gas tank.

, If detergent hasn't gotten your engine running right, you can try an engine flush such as Seafoam. The flush reacts with the carbon deposits to remove them from your intake system, including the combustion chamber.Be aware that, when starting your engine for the first time after the flush, there will be a lot of smoke.

, Start the engine and listen closely. Your knocking engine should be running smoothly now.

Consult your owner's manual or a local parts store to find the correct spark plugs.,
Prepare to work on your vehicle.,
Check your spark plugs.,
Remove and replace your spark plugs.,
Hook your battery terminals back up.",How to Stop a Car from Knocking3," A faulty spark plug can be the cause of engine knocking, and is bad for your engine overall., Find all of the tools you will need, such as a spark plug socket and gap gauge.Turn off your engine and unhook your battery terminals.

, You want to be sure that replacing the spark plugs will help. You can usually tell if there is a problem just by the residue left on your spark plug. A normal plug should have only brownish grey residue on the side electrode. If this is the only residue and the plug is otherwise intact, you should just clean it with a wire brush and fuel injector cleaner rather than replace it., This is relatively a relatively quick job and should take about an hour.If you have never changed spark plugs before you should consult How to Change Spark Plugs in a Car

, Remember to do this in the correct order. First hook up the positive cable (usually red) and then the ground wire (usually black).

Find the timing mark on your engine.,
Identify spark plug number one.,
Set your park brake.,
Turn on your engine.,
Connect your timing light to your number one spark plug wire.,
Aim the timing light at the timing mark.,
Interpret the results of your timing test.",How to Stop a Car from Knocking4," This is usually located in a small gap in the transmission bell housing. You are looking for a gap with short marks perpendicular to it. The marks will be numbered to eight or twelve, with zero in the middle. The word “Before” and “After” may also be stamped into the metal near the gap.Sometimes the gap is covered with a plastic or rubber cap. This keeps dirt out of the bellhousing., This is the plug you should use to check engine timing. You can look in your owner’s manual or service manual if you are unsure which spark plug is number one on your vehicle. It is not necessarily the first one on either end of the block., Make sure that your car is parked safely and that it will not move while you are working.

, You should let the engine warm up before checking the timing. This will yield the most accurate results., Clip the lead over the plug wire and turn on the light. Be sure that you are using the number one plug, otherwise your readings will be incorrect., When the spark plug fires, it will cause the strobe on the light to flash. This will show you what number the timing mark is on at the time the piston fires.Record these numbers.

, The numbers represent degrees from top dead center (TDC) of the piston in the number one cylinder. What this means, is that the mark indicates how far from the top the piston is when the spark ignites the fuel. If your numbers are in the range specified in your owner’s manual or service manual, your timing does not need adjusted.If not, you will need to adjust your timing to fix the knocking.

, Protect your car's finish with masking or painting tape. Don't use duct tape as it can ruin or lift the paint off your car.








,









You can use sandpaper, but remember sandpaper scratches. If your lens has heavy/severe discoloration with apparent scratches/imperfections, this requires a rougher grit sandpaper, like the 600 grit. If the headlight lens has light discoloration with no apparent scratches, start with at 2500 grit. Whichever grit you use, you want to wet the sandpaper in a bucket or cup of soapy water.
Wet the rag with a commercial plastic lens cleaner or degreaser. Make sure you wet the rag instead of spraying the headlight; this keeps the spray from getting on the paint. Wash the lens with a clean rag or a shop towel.

,









Dip one finger into a plastic polish or a compound designed for plastic. With the lens still wet, apply the polish evenly over the entire headlight.
Grab a sanding sponge or a soft hand pad and take out the starting sandpaper which you decided earlier, in most cases, the 600 grit sandpaper.
Fold the sandpaper in three around the Soft Hand Pad Or Sanding Sponge.
Dip the sponge and sandpaper into the soapy water.
Sand, using a side to side motion, applying even pressure, periodically wetting the sponge and the sandpaper in the soapy water. (Avoid contacting paint and other surrounding surfaces.)

,









Continue the sanding process using a 1200 grit paper, then even finer 2000 grit and finally 2500 grit sandpaper to remove scratches left by the previous grit.
Apply the plastic polish/ compound after sanding with the 2500-grit sandpaper. This time, let it haze, then buff/wipe off with a shop towel.
Clean the lens with a plastic lens cleaner or soap and water. This is to remove any polish residue.

, If you are not satisfied with the clarity of the lens, repeat Steps 1 – 5 until the lens is clear.









Seal the lens with wax or silicone sealer.
Fold a shop towel into four and squeeze a quarter-sized amount of wax or polish onto it and let it soak in for a few seconds.
Apply to the lens using a single stroke going from left to right gradually working your way down the entire lens.

, Remove the masking tape. The headlight repair is complete and you should now have clean headlights that look as good as new and restored optical clarity for safe night driving.

,
Polish.,
Clean.,
Apply lens sealant.",How to Restore Hazey Headlights With a New Protected Surface,";
, The lens cleaner selected should be compatible with the lens sealer used. Four grits of sandpaper may be used: 320, 600, 1000 and 1500. 320 is the most aggressive. Examine the lenses to determine the severity of damage. Severe damage is noticeable by pits, rough areas or blotchy discoloration as seen in Illustration A. Severe damage will require beginning with 320 to effectively remove all the corrosion. However if corrosion is easily removed by a finer grit you will shorten sanding steps. Your first sanding step is to remove all corrosion. To prevent accidental scuffing of surrounding surfaces masking tape may be applied. Start by sanding with water until all corrosion is removed. Dry lens and examine for any remaining corrosion. Corrosion may still be evident when the lens is dry, as can be seen in Illustration B outlining the corrosion in red. Continue sanding until the lens is smooth and and free of corrosion.The following sanding steps are to smooth the previous sanding scratches. For example, a severely corroded lens will require 320 followed by 600 then 1000, and finally 1500. Lens should be uniform in clarity before moving on to next step. Each step will produce a slightly clearer lens, as shown in the

,, Squeeze a small amount of lens polish onto one side of the lens. Using a soft cloth, rub that area vigorously until the lens shines. Continue until all of the lens becomes clear. Absolute clarity is not needed. Wipe off excess polish. After polishing any areas that may have not been sanded enough with the finer grit sandpaper, it will become evident. If you notice these, you will need to sand these areas with 1500 again and re-polish.

, This step is very important for the application of the lens sealant. Spray plastic cleaner onto lens including edges. Wait 10 seconds and clean lens with towel . Make sure no polish is remaining around edges. Repeat this step. Finally spray on plastic cleaner and lightly rub lens with a prep scuff pad and dry lens. Make sure all edges and surrounding areas are clean and dry.

, Take a 6x10 inch piece of application towel and fold into a flat two inch square. Wear gloves to keep hand clean of sealant. One half of the sealant amount will coat two average size lenses. Saturate one edge of the folded towel and wipe across entire top of lens. Continue wiping from one side to the other, working your way to the bottom of the lens. Keep the edge of your towel saturated as you coat the lens. Lens should be coated with generous amounts of sealant to achieve a wet glossy appearance. Coat lens quickly and avoid excessive wiping. Lines from wiping will self level.

If we take this from a scientific approach we must look at the problem as a doctor would when he diagnosed a problem.,
Understand oxidation.,
Understand surface damage.,
Consider your removal options.,
If your problem is oxidation you can restore your headlight lens in seconds without fear of damage to the delicate UV layer with a non abrasive DE-oxidizer, which uses a non-abrasive chemical cleaner to remove light to medium oxidation.

",How to Instantly Remove Oxidation from Headlight Without Sandpaper," Is the problem oxidation? Or is it something else?;
, Oxidation is a flat opaque covering that lays evenly on the surface of the lens, It will start out white turn yellow and eventually brown. It can build up and block all light from leaving the lens. It is semi-smooth to the touch.


If your headlights are very yellowed, even a deoxidizer will not help. At that point, your headlight's UV coating is already fully damaged and the polycarbonate is exposed to the elements. It is the nature of polycarbonate to turn yellow under UV light. Sealing the surface with a non yellowing layer will prevent the polycarbonate from turning yellow.

, This consists of obvious visual imperfections on the lens, such as chipping, scaring, scratching and damage caused by the use of a sandpaper type cleaning process.


After market sealers are the also a problem. These sealers are generally polyurethane or acrylic based. They have no yellow stopping UV protection. Over time the heat from the bulb and the light from the sun will cause them to yellow and crack. However, UV stabilized hardened clear coat paint will not yellow and crack. There are a few other coatings that supposedly do not yellow, such as certain epoxies. Be careful what type of clear coating you buy. It might be too late for you now, but the key is to preserve the UV coating with waxes and sealants when you still have a substantial UV coating left.

, Once it can be determined if the problem is oxidation or surface damage, you must next decide a method of treatment.


90% of headlights that need cleaning are afflicted with oxidation and do not need sandpaper, so don't jump to the most aggressive solution. The other 10% have actual surface damage which will need sandpaper.
If surface damage is your problem stop here. There is no process that will restore your lens. They will have to be resurfaced and that will require the use of abrasives and power tools.

Then get back in your vehicle and turn on your high beams. Some vehicles use a single bulb for both high and low beams while others do not. If the high beam on the same side is also out, it may be one bulb.You do not need to purchase specific bulbs for each side, but identifying which is the blown out bulb will help you to replace it without having to start the vehicle again.
If neither the low or high beams work on the same side, there could also be an electrical issue preventing the bulbs from getting power.;
, It’s important that you get the correct bulb for your year, make and model vehicle. Try asking the clerk at your local auto parts store to look it up in their system, or try checking the auto maker’s website for the code indicating which headlight to use.Headlight codes are usually comprised of letters and numbers like H11B or D3S.
You can find the proper code for your vehicle at websites such as www.lightbulbs4cars.com as well.

, Swapping a low beam bulb can require varying amounts of work. While some cars may require no tools at all, others may require specialized tools to help remove portions of the trim under the hood, or even the bumper and grill. Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle for a comprehensive list of tools required for the job. Most vehicles require only a screw driver or nothing at all to gain access to the headlight housing.After referring to the service manual for your vehicle, visually inspect the area around the headlight in yours to ensure it looks the same as it does in the manual.
If you purchased your vehicle used, flat head screws may have been replaced with Philips head screws or other components may have been swapped out during repairs by the previous owner.

, Be sure you remember which side of the car has a blown out low beam bulb before disconnecting the battery. To disconnect it, use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the nut holding the ground cable onto the negative terminal of the battery. You don’t need to remove the nut, just loosen it enough to slide the cable off of the terminal, then tuck the cable to the side of the battery.Tucking the cable will prevent it from popping up and coming into contact with the negative terminal of the battery.
You will not need to disconnect the positive terminal.

, In many vehicles, you will need to remove a piece of trim that separates the headlight assembly from the engine bay. This plastic piece often extends the width of the car, but in some there may be individual pieces for each headlight. In some newer GM vehicles, you may also need to remove the front bumper cover in order to access the headlight assemblies.Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle to better understand what pieces of the vehicle will need to be removed to access the headlights.
Be careful not to break plastic fasteners or snaps your vehicle may use to hold trim pieces in place.
Replacement fasteners and snaps of most kinds can be purchased at your local auto parts store.

, Many newer vehicles use a plastic headlight housing to hold the headlight bulb in place, while some others use a metal or plastic bracket. Use your vehicle’s service manual to locate the bracket or holder, then remove the headlight and wire pigtail from it. In many vehicles, you will only need to twist the headlight a quarter turn counter clockwise and pull it out straight back to remove it.If you have to remove any bolts from a headlight assembly bracket, make sure to keep them someplace safe until you reassemble that portion of the car.
In some vehicles, you will need to unbolt the headlight assembly and slide it out of the car to access the headlight bulb itself in the back.

, The headlight bulb should still be in a socket connected to wiring coming from your vehicle. Disconnect the wires by unclipping them from the bottom of the headlight bulb housing and pull on it gently to disconnect it. Ensure you pull on the plastic clip and not the wires, as you may accidentally pull them out of the headlight bulb housing, causing your headlights to fail to function.Be careful unsnapping the clip. They are often made of brittle plastic and may break easily.
If you break the clip, you can secure it in place with a single strip of electrical tape, or purchase a replacement clip to solder in place of the old one.

, Place your index finger and thumb as low as possible at the base of the bulb and pull to remove it from the bulb housing. Do not pinch the larger portion near the top of the bulb as it may crack or break and cut you. A broken bulb is significantly harder to remove.If you break the bulb, use a pair of pliers to remove what is left in the bulb housing.
Discard the blown out bulb in the trash once complete.

, The oil on your hands can compromise the glass of the bulb, reducing its lifespan. Protect your bulb from this by wearing gloves or using a tissue any time you come into contact with the glass of the new low beam headlight bulb. Be careful not to drop the bulb as you remove it from the package.If you touch the bulb, use rubbing alcohol and a paper towel or rag to wipe it off.

, Keep your gloves on or the bulb in a tissue as you slide it into the bulb housing. Be careful not to apply too much pressure to the top of the bulb as you press it in to avoid cracking or breaking the glass. Make sure the bulb is seated firmly in the bulb housing so it has a solid electrical connection.You may need to press on the top of the bulb to get it to fit in properly, just be careful not to push too hard.
If you feel like you have to force the bulb in, it may not be the correct bulb for your vehicle.

, Take the wiring pigtail you disconnected from the bulb previously and reattach it to the back of the bulb assembly with the new headlight bulb in it. Make sure the clip snaps into place and holds the wiring pigtail firmly. If the wires come loose while you are driving, the headlight will stop working.The headlight bulb and assembly should now be connected to the car once again.
Be careful not to yank on the assembly with it connected, as you may rip a wire out of the harness.

, Wipe the bulb off again with rubbing alcohol if you feel it may have come into contact with your skin, then slide it into the headlight housing. Turn the bulb assembly a quarter turn clockwise to re-secure it, or reinstall the bracket that held your headlight bulb in place.Tug on the headlight bulb assembly once it is secure to make sure it’s held firmly in place.
Make sure to use the same bolts you removed to secure the bracket if equipped.

, With the headlight completely reassembled, replace the trim pieces you removed in the opposite order you took them off in. Many trim pieces overlap, so it’s important to put them back on in the proper order.Reconnect the battery once the trim has been reassembled.
Turn the headlights on and check to make sure the new bulb works.

, Before starting any work on the electrical system of your vehicle, you should always disconnect the battery. Locate the battery in your vehicle and use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut on the negative terminal. With the nut loose, pull the cable up and off the terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery to prevent it from coming back into contact with the terminal.Locate the negative terminal by looking for the letters “NEG” or the negative (-) symbol.
You will not need to disconnect the positive terminal.

, In many modern vehicles, you will need to remove engine covers or plastic trim components in order to access the back of the headlight. Be careful removing plastic clips that hold trim pieces in place, as they may be brittle and prone to cracking or breaking.You can usually purchase replacement clips at your local auto parts store if you break one.
Refer to the service manual for your vehicle for specific instructions on how to access your headlight.

, Press down on the plastic release clip on the wire pigtail going into the back of the headlight. Maintain pressure on the release as you pull the clip backward to disconnect it.Do not pull on the wiring itself or you may accidentally remove them from the pigtail.
Inspect the inside of the pigtail for damage. If there are signs of burning or melting, there may be an issue with your vehicle’s electrical system.

, Rotate the back of the headlight bulb counter clockwise to release it from the plastic headlight housing. Remove the bulb by sliding it back out of the plastic housing. In some applications, the bulb will be held in a plastic assembly and will need to be pulled out to be replaced.Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle if it is not easy to assess how to remove the bulb.

Pull the headlight out toward you and disconnect the wiring.,
Connect the new light and slide it into place.,
Screw the ring back into place.",How to Fix a Burned Out Headlight3," Sealed beam style headlights were common in older model vehicles. These headlights are entirely self-contained and tend to be three to five inches in diameter. Because these headlights need to be pulled out, start by removing any parts of the vehicle’s exterior trim that surrounds the headlights.You may not need to remove any trim components depending on the application.

, In some trucks, you will need to remove all or parts of the grill in order to access the headlight screws and connections. Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle to determine what parts, if any, of the grill you’ll need to remove.If you need to remove the grill, it is usually secured with bolts along the top and a series of clips.
You will need to gain access to the screws that hold the headlight in place. Remove anything you need to in order to reach them.

, Sealed beam style headlights are commonly held in place by a metal of plastic ring that is secured with multiple screws or bolts. Use the appropriate hand tool (screw driver or wrench) to remove each of these fasteners and set them aside somewhere safe.You will need to reuse the fasteners, so be careful not to lose them.
If any of the bolts or screws are severely rusted or damaged, be sure to replace them.

, With the ring removed, grip the headlight with your thumbs and fore fingers and pull it toward you, out of the front of the vehicle.

Make sure the battery is securely anchored to the vehicle.,
Invest in a battery terminal remover tool.,
Once the terminal end is removed, inspect the mating ends for corrosion, pits or cracks.,
After removing the hold down strap and terminal ends, remove the battery from the vehicle and place on a plastic box or covering.

,
Before uncovering the filler ports, gently hose down the top of the battery and brush off the accumulated debris.

,
Take a towel and dry off the entire casing.

,
Remove the filler ports and check the fluid levels.,
Do a load test.,
When reinstalling a used or new battery, use a terminal conditioner on the cable and terminal ends.,
Reinstall the hold down brackets or straps making sure not to over-tighten, which can warp the brackets and break the battery case.

",How to Tune up Your Battery," An often neglected component of a battery is its hold down straps. An unsecured battery is an accident waiting to happen. The bouncing of a vehicle, especially a tractor over a plowed field, can cause a battery to scoot around in its housing and possibly short out against another metal component, causing a fire. If not that, it can certainly break a terminal, cable, or case, or even turn over and leak. Purchase a battery hold down kit and install it. It is cheap insurance against car, tractor, truck damage and will increase the life span of the battery.;
, This cool tool looks like a small gear puller with clamps. After the terminal bolt is loosened, the puller makes removal of the terminal an easy job. Don't screw a stuck terminal back and forth or use a screwdriver to try to pry it off. You can inadvertently crack the battery case or break the seal between the case and the protruding terminal. A puller is cheap, easy to use, and does the job correctly.

, A battery terminal cleaner works great for removing corrosion build up. This tool has two wire brush ends; one male, the other female. Use it to brush the ends until they shine. Sometimes a terminal end will have a hard blackish coating on it. This lead oxidation stops the electricity from flowing and creates excessive heat at the connection. It won't always come off with the wire brush so you may have to use a small file. Make sure to rotate the file around the terminal as you go so you won't create a lot of flat spots. Don't remove too much material, then tidy up the terminal with the brush. If the bolt is corroded, replace with a new one.

,,,, Place on charger and fill accordingly. Whenever possible, use distilled water. Using impure water in a lead acid battery will harm battery performance and life. Remember to use safety eye equipment and gloves, especially when uncovering the filler ports. If the vehicle's alternator is defective and overcharging the battery, then the water in the battery will be electrolyzing into gas. If the filler ports are sealed, the covers cannot vent this gas (hydrogen and oxygen). Pressure may build up and be released when you remove the covers.

, With the battery installed in the vehicle, attach a voltmeter to the battery terminals. Ground the coil to keep the engine from starting and crank the motor over for 15 seconds. If the battery voltage stays above 9.6 volts, then the battery is in a reasonable state of charge. Below that amount indicates a shorted cell or a lowered capacity due to the battery is heavily sulfated harming its useful life. Treat it with ResureX additive and install the MAXI-Life Pulse you could recover from the junk 80% of discarded ones. (BCI source)

, The conditioner comes in a spray can and goes on like a red paint. The coating slows battery acid corrosion and lead oxidation and will lengthen the time between cleanings. One can also install felt pads onto the battery posts which have been saturated with baking soda. These also tend to slow acid corrosion. The negative cable has the smaller end and goes to the corresponding terminal.

Consider having plastic adhesion added.",How to Clean Headlights," If you've noticed that your headlights are hazier or not as crisp as they once were, examine them in daylight, both on and off. It's important to figure out how bad the damage is to know which cleaning methods will be the most effective, whether you need to get the headlights examined professionally, or whether the headlights might need replaced. Look for major abrasions and scratches that might be signs of more serious issues.






;
, Regular road grit and grime can make your headlights look dirty and hazy to a degree that can make a more accurate diagnosis difficult. Before you start looking for specific problems, just give your car a wash with regular warm water and car wash soap. Wipe down the headlights and let them dry thoroughly. Examine them clean to look for specific issues.








, Haziness will occur when all of the hard coat has worn off the headlights and the soft polycarbonate is exposed, beginning to absorb scratches that creates hazing. The lens will soon be covered in a rough dark yellow crusted surface.









If this seems to be the problem, doing a cheap quick clean will be an effective way of slowing the degeneration of the headlights, but a more comprehensive clean may be called for.

, This occurs when all of the hard coat is beginning to thin out and lose adhesion to the polycarbonate lens. The UV wavelength spectrum creates a new repeating unit in the carbonic chain which absorbs blue light, and results in a yellowish appearance.









If you notice yellowish coloring on the headlights, you need to opt for a more comprehensive clean, using Rain-X or some polishing compound to clean them up and correct the damage. A thin layer of transmission fluid can temporarily clear them up as well.

, When the hard coat begins to deteriorate, you will notice spotting in certain areas such as the upper region or the corners. The hard coat can appear to flake off or peeling off. Eventually, you'll see cracks deep into the lens, which means the headlights will need to be resurfaced by a professional.









If this is the case, you might need to replace your headlights or have them resurfaced, which might end up costing more. In the meantime, clean them up as best you can using a quick method and start pricing new headlights.

, Most headlights are plastic and will exhibit the symptoms described above. Glass headlights, as are found on classic cars and older models, are more complicated and are best examined by professional body technicians. If your glass headlights are wearing out, take them in and have them checked.








, To start with, you're going to buff out the headlights, using an increasingly-fine series of wet/dry sandpaper. 3M is usually the best brand for the job, and you typically want to have at least one coarser grade (1500 or so) and a finer grade to finish abrading the headlight (around 2000). If you want to start with coarser sandpaper, that's up to you.








, Any time you're using sandpaper around the car, you want to make sure you don't get too vigorous and scratch the paint. For this reason, it's usually a good idea to use some painter's tape around the edge, where the lights meet the painted part of the car, to avoid scratching up the paint. This isn't necessary, but it's worth taking the extra few minutes to protect your paint job.









Before you get started sanding, it's usually a good idea to wipe down the headlights once more, using clean paper towels and a bit of rubbing alcohol. This should dry quickly and you'll be ready to go.

, Using a water spray bottle or a small bucket, wet sand the headlights thoroughly with your coarser grit sandpaper. Use even pressure and sand away at the headlight, until you have an even, dull finish.









If the factory coating begins to come off, you will notice a hazy ""line"" begin to appear and change shape as it is sanded off. It is generally best to sand the coating completely off.

, After going over the headlights with your coarse paper, switch to a sandpaper with a higher grit-count and repeat the process until the finish changes from dull to kind of ""satiny.""









On headlights with an interior texture where you cannot necessarily see the bulb, you can usually stop at 1500 grit paper. The headlights will look hazy, but even and not yellow.

, Once you've sanded down the headlights and worked out the hazing, it's time to switch to a buffing compound of some kind. Lots of different choices are available, including McGuire’s, M105, and 3M compound. Visit the auto parts store for a variety of options. Aluminum polishing compounds are the best bet to get the headlights into good shape. Non-abrasive bathroom acrylic tub and sink cleaner is designed for plastics, works well and may already be under your sink.









If you're looking for a cheap option, plain blue toothpaste is a common substitute. Use plain blue toothpaste, not anything with peroxide, whitening agent, or other additives.

, Take a clean towel, apply a quarter-sized glob of buffing compound, a pick a small area of the headlight to focus on, say 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 centimeters). Work it in a circular motion, polishing repeatedly and uniformly in your little square. It should take less than five minutes or so for the section to start looking clearer. Once you've buffed a square, move on to the next









If you want to use a hand drill with a buffing kit, you can apply buffing compound directly to a foam pad that will spin on the drill, then buff the headlights at a low RPM. Using gentle pressure, slowly ease the RPMs up, moving the pad uniformly around the headlight. Go slowly, about an inch a second. This will go much faster than polishing by hand.

, It'll take some elbow grease, because you may want to add as many as three coats of buffing compound to get your headlights like you want them. Go until you're satisfied with the clarity and the sharpness of the light. You can test your headlights by shining them against the wall of the garage, or some other flat surface.








, If you want to really seal your headlights and keep them in good shape, you might consider having a local auto body shop mask and spray the headlights with a plastic adhesion promoter, like Bulldog. That plus a few coats of automotive clear-coat helps to extend the life of headlights considerably, and should only cost between $20-50, depending on the shop. A less expensive option is acrylic floor wax. Apply a coat and let dry. Multiple coats can be applied for a more durable finish and it can be re-applied as necessary.

Squeeze a line of toothpaste onto one side of a soft sponge.,
Vigorously rub the sponge in a circular motion over the entire surface of your headlight.,
Use a dry, clean rag to wipe away any remaining toothpaste.,
Repeat every two to four months as needed.",How to Clean Headlights with Toothpaste," Toothpaste brands that contain plaque removal properties work most effectively at removing oxidation and grime from the surface of your headlights.;
, This will remove grime, dirt, and oxidation from the headlight.

, When complete, your headlights will be clean and free of foggy residue.

Mix vinegar and water.,
Spray vinegar glass cleaner on the headlights.,
Wipe away dirt with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Headlights with Vinegar1," To make a vinegar glass cleaning solution, you can mix three parts water with one part white distilled vinegar. For example, you might mix three cups of water with one cup of vinegar.








You can also use this solution to clean your car’s windows.;
, Put the vinegar and water solution in an empty spray bottle. Spritz the mixture onto the headlight cover. Make sure that you completely cover the headlight with the vinegar. You can let it soak for a minute to help loosen dirt.







, Using a clean microfiber cloth, wipe away the vinegar solution from the headlight. This will help remove bugs, visible dirt, and other surface grime. You may want to make broad circular motions to reduce streaks. Most dirt should come off easily, but you can scrub a little if there is something stuck on the headlight.









Your headlights may still be yellow or foggy, even after you clean off the visible debris. You can remove these issues by using a baking powder and vinegar mixture.
You may repeat this as many times as you need to remove the dirt.

"
Mix vinegar with baking soda.,
Apply the mixture to your headlights.,
Rinse off the solution with clean water.,
Repeat if necessary.",How to Clean Headlights with Vinegar2," In a Styrofoam cup or measuring bowl, mix two parts white vinegar to one part baking soda. The two substances will start to foam.








For example, you might use four tablespoons vinegar and two tablespoons baking soda, but this might vary. Add more or less as you need it.

, Dip a clean cloth into the vinegar and baking soda mixture. Rub it onto the headlight. Work your way around the entire headlight, including the edges. Make small, circular motions to help spread the mixture.







, Rinse off the solution with water. If there is any baking soda left, it will leave a white haze on the light. Keep rinsing until the headlight is clear and sparkling. Once it is clear, you can wipe it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel.









You can rinse the headlight using a sponge. Soak the sponge in clean water, and use it to wipe away the baking soda. You may need to squeeze out the sponge and soak it again to help remove all of the baking soda.You can also rinse it by filling a spray bottle with water. Spray the headlight, and wipe the water away until the baking soda is completely gone.

, If the yellow discoloration is severe or if you have not cleaned your headlights in a while, you may need to repeat this process. Apply more of the solution to the headlight, scrub, and rinse.

Put the ingredients over boiling water by using a double boiler. Heat the wax, and stir frequently until the waxes have melted.








Carnauba wax can be bought at auto stores.
If you don’t have a double boiler, put the ingredients in a clean tin can. Set the can in middle of a pot of boiling water. Be careful not to scald yourself when removing the can.

, Once the waxes have melted into one another, you should pour the wax into a different container, such as a jar or Pyrex measuring cup. Let the wax cool until it is solid. Once the wax is solid, it is ready to be used.









If you use a container with a lid, you can save the cooled wax for later.

, Once the wax is cool, you can scoop it up with a clean cloth. Apply it to the headlights. Work it across the entire headlight using circular motions.







, With a different cloth, buff off the wax. Make sure that there are no streaks or residue left on afterwards. The headlight should look polished and sparkling.

Grab a multimeter.,
Set your multimeter to ohms.,
Find resistance value of your multimeter.,
Test the voltage of the battery.,
Locate the glow plugs.,
Remove the caps or connectors to the glow plugs.,
Clip the multimeter’s negative lead to a ground point in the engine.,
Connect the positive lead of your multimeter to the top of the glow plug.,
Evaluate the multimeter’s reading.,
Replace the glow plugs.",How to Test Glow Plugs1," A multimeter is a black box of electronic circuitry used to test electrical wiring or devices. There is a large dial in the center of the multimeter where you can adjust the settings. The multimeter uses black (negative) and red (positive) leads to test electrical currency and resistance. These leads usually have metal clamps at the end of them. While the multimeter can seem daunting because of its many numbers and dials, you only need to use one setting for this test.Analog meters may apply higher voltage to the circuit than the digital meter, so use them with care.The first reading you get from a digital multimeter may not be accurate, since the current can fluctuate. Digital multimeters have a difficult time measuring current that is constantly changing.Because analog multimeters have a changing display, they can show you the current fluctuations. However, analog multimeters are less accurate overall.It is best to use a digital multimeter for this test. A digital multimeter shows the exact number result of the test. An analog multimeter is harder to read because every possible result is listed at the top.If you are using an analog multimeter, make sure to choose one with at least 20k ohm/V sensitivity.;
, The ohms setting will be denoted by a shape that resembles an upside down horseshoe. There will be two long vertical lines containing the range of the ohms.

, Cross the two leads of the multimeter over each other and record the result. Make sure the metal clamps of the leads touch each other. If you are using a digital multimeter, then the reading will appear across the screen.


Subtract this amount from the glow plug reading.

, Put your multimeter in DC Volt reading mode. Place the negative lead of your multimeter onto the negative terminal of the battery, and the positive lead onto the positive terminal. The reading should be close to 12.5 Volts when the car is off and close to 13 Volts when the car is running.


If this is not the case, check your battery or alternator before proceeding. Glow plugs will not work correctly if they do not have the correct voltage running into them.

, Consult the shop manual of your vehicle to find the location of the glow plugs in the engine. This will vary based on the make and model of your vehicle.

, There is usually a cover or cap over the glow plugs. Remove the cover or cap in order to apply the multimeter clamps to the glow plugs.


Look at the connector and pins for any signs of rust or corrosion and looseness. Take this opportunity to clean them.

, The main two ground points can be found by following the wire that leads from the negative battery terminal into the engine wall or following the wire that leads from the alternator into the engine wall. These wires are attached to bolts. Attach the negative lead onto one of these bolts for grounding.


Consult your owner’s manual to find the exact locations of the ground points.

,


If the multimeter's negative lead is still connected to the negative battery terminal, then you can leave it there., Refer to your shop manual to determine the test specs for your vehicle.


Subtract the resistance value of your multimeter from the resistance value of your glow plug. For example, if your plug's resistance measured .9 ohms and your meter's resistance measured .2 ohms, the real reading for the plug is .7 ohms.All the glow plugs in your engine should have similar readings. One glow plug with a higher resistance can affect your engine's performance--even if the plug is still good., If one or more of the glow plugs is faulty, replace all of them. Never replace a single plug.If the area around the glow plugs has dirt or buildup, clean it first.


Some manufacturers have special tools to clean out the bore where the glow plugs are inserted into the cylinder head. These tools clean out carbon buildup in the area inside the combustion chamber or precharge chamber. The tool also cleans the threads that the glow plug screws into. This tool is sometimes called a ""reamer."""

Open the hood of the vehicle.,
Find the starter.,
Identify the cylinder on the side of the starter.,
Listen for the solenoid to click when the key is turned.,
Check the battery.",How to Test a Starter Solenoid1," The starter and solenoid are located on the engine of your vehicle. In order to gain access to it, pull on the hood release located near the door on the driver’s side of the vehicle.You will need to release the safety latch on the front of the vehicle in order to open the hood as well.
If you are unable to locate the safety release, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for directions.;
, The starter is usually located near where the engine and transmission meet. The starter itself is usually cylindrical in shape with a smaller cylinder attached to it. There should be a wire coming directly from the positive terminal of the battery to the starter.While starters come in many sizes, they are usually shaped the same.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual if you are unable to locate the starter.

, The smaller cylinder attached to the top or side of the starter is the starter solenoid. It is a fairly simple electrical mechanism that can fail, preventing the starter from engaging and starting the motor.The starter solenoid will have two terminals coming out of its end.
The wire from the battery will connect to one of those two terminals.

, Have a friend turn the key in the ignition to attempt to start the vehicle. Listen carefully, as you should hear a click when the starter solenoid engages. If you do not hear a click, the starter solenoid is likely not functioning properly. If you do hear clicking, the solenoid may be engaging, but not sufficiently.Hearing clicking without the starter motor moving means the solenoid is transferring the electricity, but it may not be enough.
No clicking means the solenoid is not properly engaging, but this may also be due to a dead battery.

, If your starter is failing to engage, it may be because the battery does not have sufficient energy to power it. Rule this out by testing the battery with a volt meter. Low power could result in the starter clicking but failing to engage. Place the positive (red) lead on the voltmeter on the positive terminal of the battery and negative (black) lead on the negative terminal. Your battery should measure at around 12 volts at a rest before you attempt to start the vehicle.
If the voltage is low, the battery may just need to be charged.

Remove the glow plugs from your engine.,
Set your multimeter to ohms.,
Find resistance value of your multimeter.,
Place the negative lead of the multimeter onto the nut of the glow plug.,
Place the positive lead onto the tip of the glow plug.,
Find the results on the multimeter.,
Replace the glow plugs.",How to Test Glow Plugs2," Check your owner’s manual to locate the glow plugs and find the best way to remove them. This will vary based on the model and make of your vehicle.

, Use the lowest ohms setting. If the measurement of the glow plug is too high for the setting of the multimeter, then the plug is bad.

, Cross the two leads of the multimeter over each other and record the result.


Subtract this amount from the glow plug reading.

, Make sure you do no not place the negative lead higher than the nut.

, The tip is exposed when you pull the glow plug cap off.

, Check your shop manual for your vehicle's test specs.


Subtract the resistance value of your multimeter from the resistance value of your glow plug. For example, if your plug's resistance measured .9 ohms and your meter's resistance measured .2 ohms, the real reading for the plug is .7 ohms.

Connect a test light to the output terminal of the solenoid.,
Ground the black lead from the test light.,
Observe the light.,
Switch the red lead to the lower terminal on the solenoid.,
Have a friend turn the ignition.,
Look for the light to come on.",How to Test a Starter Solenoid2," There are two small terminals sticking out of the face of a starter solenoid. One is the 12 volt positive (top) that comes from the battery. When the starter solenoid is activated, it connects the lower terminal to the upper one internally, engaging the starter motor.There should be continuous power going to the top solenoid terminal.
Press the red lead from the test light onto the top terminal and hold it in place.

, The black lead from the test light must be connected to a grounded surface in order to complete the circuit and test the power passing through it. Any part of the body of the vehicle will suffice as a ground, provided it is bare metal.You can touch the black lead to any bare metal on the body of the vehicle.
You may also touch it to the negative terminal on the battery.

, If the light comes on when you have the test light touching the top terminal on the starter solenoid and the other lead grounded, it means there is electricity coming from the battery to the starter solenoid itself. This means there could be an issue with the solenoid, rather than simply a dead battery.Once you have confirmed that there is power going to the solenoid, you can test if the solenoid is transferring it properly.

, Now that you have confirmed that there is power going into the solenoid, the next step is to determine whether or not the solenoid is transferring the power properly. Place the red lead on the lower terminal that should only have power when the vehicle is starting.Hold the lead in place on the lower terminal.
Keep the black lead grounded.

, While you hold the two leads in place, ask a friend to turn the ignition. This should make the solenoid bridge the connections internally and send electricity to the lower terminal on the solenoid.Be careful not to get your hands or clothes in the way of any engine components that may move if the vehicle starts.
Do not allow the test light wiring to hang into the area around the belts.

, If the test light comes on, it means the solenoid is transferring power from the battery to the starter. If the starter fails to activate despite the light coming on, the starter itself may need to be replaced. If the light does not come on, it means the solenoid is failing to transfer the power and will need to be replaced.You can often purchase a starter and starter solenoid together, as it may be easier to replace them both at once.
Make sure to tell the clerk at your local auto parts store the correct year, make and model of your vehicle to purchase the right replacement parts.

Connect the voltmeter to the positive terminal on the battery.,
Connect the negative lead to the ground terminal.,
Observe the reading on the voltmeter.,
Have a friend turn the ignition.,
Move the voltmeter to the leads on the starter solenoid.,
Look for an appropriate voltage drop.",How to Test a Starter Solenoid3," A voltmeter will show you how much voltage is currently passing through the circuit the meter is a part of. Start by attaching the positive lead (red) from the voltmeter to the positive terminal on the battery.The positive terminal will be labeled with the letters “POS” or the positive (+) symbol.
Some volt meters may clip into place, while others may require you to hold to lead onto the battery.

, This test is to determine how much voltage the starter solenoid is drawing from the battery when it is attempting to start. Place the negative lead (black) from the voltmeter on the negative terminal on the battery to complete the circuit.With the positive and negative leads connected to the battery, the voltmeter should turn on.

, Your car battery should produce approximately 12 volts when nothing is drawing off of it. Read the display on the volt meter to ensure your battery is producing an adequate level of power.If the voltmeter reads less than 12 volts, the vehicle may not be starting due to insufficient charge on the battery.
The number may jump around as you move the leads a bit and the meter tries to read the voltage. Wait for it to settle to determine the baseline voltage.

, While holding the leads on the positive and negative terminals on the battery, have a friend turn the key in the ignition to attempt to start the vehicle. Be careful to stay clear of anything that may move if the engine actually starts.The voltage reading from the battery should drop approximately half a volt while the starter attempts to start the vehicle.
If the voltage does not drop, there is an issue with the connection from the battery to the starter.

, Place the positive lead from the voltmeter on lower terminal from the solenoid (closer to the starter). Then place the negative lead on the upper most terminal coming from the battery. Have your friend turn the key again.Ensure the leads are firmly touching or attached to the terminals coming from the solenoid for a good reading.

, The voltage drop you see on the solenoid should match the drop you saw on the battery. The drop in voltage should not exceed a half a volt. If you do not read any voltage at all, the solenoid needs to be replaced.If the voltage drops less than a half a volt, there is an issue inside the solenoid.
If the voltage drops too much, there may be a fault somewhere in the connection, such as a crimped line from the battery to the solenoid.

, Vehicles around this model year usually have a hood release lever under the steering column to initiate this step. Once done, lift the hood and insert the stick to hold the hood in place for operation.

, Using an 8mm socket wrench or 8mm wrench remove the terminal nut from the negative cable and gently place it somewhere safe. Doing so will reduce the chances of sparking the battery and damaging any other electrical part in the vehicle.

, Simply press down on the brake as you press and the hold the button on the parking brake to pull up the lever until it locks the mechanism.

, You will need to lift the front of the vehicle using a floor jack. Find a secure spot strong enough under the vehicle and jack the car until you’re able to station the jack stand under the designated position. Remember to block the rear wheels.

, Once the vehicle is properly raised, it's time to go under the vehicle. Place a carpet, mat, or cardboard box on the ground to lye on and remove the two terminal nuts with a 13mm wrench from around the electrical wires. Also, you can do this without going under the vehicle. Depending on your preference.

Go to the auto parts store, and acquire some battery terminal goo, the stuff that prevents corrosion.,
Remove any rubber or plastic covers off of the battery terminals.,
Do you see any blue or white powder/corrosion forming anywhere?,
If yes, you see corrosion, then you've got work to do.,
Get a wire brush and scrape off all the corrosion crud from the bolt, the cable assembly and the battery terminal itself.,
Check again to make sure you've got every last bit of corrosion brushed off.,
Once everything's hunky dory and spotless, then spread the goo or spray all the mating surfaces completely.

,
Now you're ready to put it all together.",How to Take Care of Automotive Batteries," Usually comes with a new battery. Better yet, you can purchase some battery corrosion prevention spray. It does the same thing and is easier to apply.;
, Not the posts on top, but the terminals on the side that the cables bolt on to.

, If no, put the covers back on and crack open a beer, you're done.

, Remove both battery terminals with a socket wrench. Make sure you remove the NEGATIVE (black) cable first. Please watch what you're doing here. Don't short circuit the red terminal to any metal part of the engine or your going to be sorry. Just be cool when you ratchet the wrench back and forth.

, Get inside the threads of the battery female connector. Make real sure you get all the crud off the cable assembly, including the connectors. I have had to cut off the rubber insulation so that I could get all the corrosion off. Just make sure to cut the rubber so that you can put it back on later. Tip - pour boiling water over the corrosion before starting any other cleaning - it will dissolve much of the deposits and wash them away. Dissolving some baking soda in the water will neutralize the acid in the crud. Wash down thoroughly with plenty of cold water afterwards.

, The corrosion is battery acid that has reacted with the air and metal. If you don't get it off, it continues to react and cause problems. In fact some say it will slide down the cable assay insulation and force you to replace the whole assembly at considerable cost.

,, You will be in and under the wheel well most of the time., you can remove the plastic rivets with a large screwdriver or stretch the rubber guards over the heads of the rivets., (just aft of the strut). The starter will not fit through this space without moving this brake line first., It is held in place by an O ring. twist and pull the upper section up. It comes out reasonably easy, plug the top of the bottom section with a paper towel as to not contaminate the transmission fluid.,, You will have to go under the truck and come in from behind the starter through a maze of brake lines etc. The swivel headed ratchet makes this job MUCH easier. Using a 12 to 14 inch (30.5 to 35.6 cm) extension and the same 14mm socket and swivel ratchet remove the top bolt., Depress the plastic locking key and slide the plug out. Fortunately this removed easy, because there is little room to maneuver and no room to use pliers. If you had to use force there is no room for leverage., THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE JOB. I was unable to do it myself and ended up having a Toyota Service supervisor come to my home and assist me. He said only two of his three techs are able to perform this task. The starter needs to be removed gears first, through the wheel well opening, it needs to be lifted (gears up) and rotated toward the opening so that it is removed not quite horizontally. As the starter is moved toward the opening it has to be rotated so the positive battery lead bolt can clear obstructions. The starter is then advanced in position and rotated opposite direction. Advance the starter in position and wiggle it in position until it can be removed. This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds. As I said I was unable to perform this task., You will need an impact driver to take the starter apart and check the bushes (also called lunge contacts). The brushes are usually just over an inch long and spring-loaded, if they appear to have plenty of carbon left then look to your stator. Bluish burns on the copper windings indicate bad spots, and the starter should be replaced. As difficult as this job was, replacing the starter is worth every dime. After market starters are approx. $100. Toyota I believe is closer to $300., wiggle it around until it goes into the engine compartment, maneuver the starter until the gears go into the flywheel housing then line it up and push it into place. It is difficult to tell whether the gears and flywheel mesh, but rotate the starter back and forth and the gears should mesh. Using a 12–14 inch (30.5–35.6 cm) flat piece of anything, prop the starter up so that you may start the bolts into the starter housing. I had better success with the lower bolt first, and pulling the starter up to the flywheel housing cautiously to check the gear mesh. Leave the lower bolt loose and start the top bolt. After re-installing the starter, I had difficulty tightening this top bolt. I was able to reach this bolt through the wheel well (with no extension or flex socket) for final tightening. Tighten the bolts checking the gap between the flywheel housing and the starter to ensure the gears meshed properly. If they are coming together unevenly remove either bolt, loosen the other bolt and rotate the starter back and forth until it goes into place. The limited access to the starter makes this process more difficult because of lack of mobility of the starter. Repeat the re-bolting process, and tighten down the bolts. I do not know the torque values if any. I use the tight is tight, too tight is broke, method., Rebolt the brake line bracket, replace the negative battery lead and start the truck. If the truck starts, shut it off, remove the jack stands, replace the wheel, remove the jack and tighten down the wheel bolts."

Adding a fuel cleaning additive to your car (as stated in the instructions on the bottle) will help clean these deposits out.;
, It will take a little bit of time for the fuel cleaning additive to mix with the fuel and to reach the engine.


If the car runs worse than before, change the fuel filter. This is because the deposits that the cleaner has removed from the fuel tank has clogged up the fuel filter.

Change the oil and oil filter in your engine.",How to Restore Lost Power in an Old Car3,",


If petrol/oil is leaking, this is dangerous as petrol/oil is highly flammable. Furthermore, it is very slippery which could cause loss of control for other vehicles. Not only that, it prevents the fluids from doing their jobs correctly as the leaking fluid cannot reach the engine.

, Air filters get clogged up with dirt (or sometimes leaves) over the years which will restrict the amount of air that can flow into the engine resulting in less fuel being burnt in air making the combustion process harder to take place. Changing the air filter will improve air flow into the engine resulting in a better fuel:air ratio.

, As time goes on, microscopic pieces of metal (from within the engine) end up in the oil which causes extra friction within the engine. This restricts the engine components ability to move. Changing the oil and filter will be less viscous than the oil you took out making the engine much more rev happy.

Follow up with a mechanic to make sure that there are no underlying problems.",How to Jumpstart a Vehicle," Components like lights, windshield wipers, radios, etc. draw power from the battery to run. If you want your battery to charge effectively, they will need to be turned off. .;
, In order to jumpstart your vehicle you will need another vehicle that has a good battery to give you a boost. Usually parking the cars facing each other will get the batteries closes, but sometimes it's better to park them side by side. Either way, be sure that the cars are not touching.

, You will need these to connect the dead battery to the good battery. Current will flow between them, allowing your engine to start and charge your dead battery. If you have a choice, longer cables can be easier to connect but transfer energy less effectively than short cables. Also, a lower gauge cable (thicker) will transfer energy faster.

, The batteries will be located in a different place depending on the make and model of the vehicles. Most batteries will be found either under the hood and or in the trunk of your vehicle. Sometimes the battery is not easily accessible. If this is the case you most likely have a charging post under the hood that is connected to the battery.

, You should connect one red clip to the red post on the dead battery first. Next you should connect the other red clip to the red post of the good battery.

, Connect one black clip to the black post on the good battery. Your cables are live now, so be careful not to touch the last metal clip to yourself or any part of your car besides unpainted metal under the hood.

, This piece of metal is referred to as a ground and completes the circuit. When the circuit is completed it can cause an arc of electricity (sparking). This could damage your battery and is why you should ground the circuit away from your battery and NOT on the black battery terminal of the dead battery., This will start the process of charging your battery.

, You want to have enough power to turn the engine over when you hit the key. One good way to see if you have battery power is to turn on an interior light. If it burns normally then you might be able to start your car. If the light is dim or doesn’t come on you should wait a little longer.

, Sometimes you can start your car immediately after hooking up the jumper cables. If it doesn’t start the first time you can try two or three times, but if it still doesn’t start you will need to wait and allow the battery time to charge., Once your car is solidly running it is time to remove the jumper cables. Start by removing the black clip attached to the metal ground.

, You should first remove the black clip from the good battery. Next you will remove the red clip from the same battery.

, Now the cables should be completely disconnected and you can put them away. You can also close the hoods of both cars.

, As your motor runs it turns your alternator. This in turn charges your battery. You should allow your battery to charge up for a few minutes before hitting the road., Sometimes the cause of a dead battery is as simple as cold weather or forgetting to turn your lights off. Other times there can be a more serious issue such as a bad alternator. If you suspect this is the case you should follow up with a mechanic.

, Car batteries are usually twelve Volts. Trucks/tractors may operate on a twenty-four volt system, sometimes two twelve volt batteries combined to make a twenty-four volt system. Do not attach 12V to 24V.

, Make sure the cars are not touching.








, Open the hood of each of the cars.








, Unplug anything charging in the cigarette lighter. They waste power and might even be damaged by surges of power.

, The jaws of the cable clamps are designed to bite into the soft metal of the battery clamps that are attached to the battery terminal posts.

, If any of these exist, stop. Call a tow truck, do not attempt to jump the car, do not even connect the cables.

, Then connect the other end with the red clamp to the positive (+) post on the good battery.









Remember, the order in which you attach the clams does matter, so follow these steps exactly.

,, Do not connect this clamp to the negative post of the dead battery—do this only as a last resort. (See tips for suggestions on what metal parts to clamp to.)








, It will charge its own battery and the dead one.








, Never race the engine. If a ""fast"" idle is not enough to charge the dead battery then it's not going to charge.

Locate the battery in your car.,
Check the battery's water level every 2 to 3 months, only if it's a non-maintenance-free wet-cell battery.,
Clean the battery terminals with a wire brush every 6 to 8 months.,
Coat the battery with grease made for high temperatures.,
Inspect cell voltage every time you get an oil change or have your car in for maintenance.,
Check the battery insulator, if your car has one.,
Take your car in to your mechanic or shop for regular servicing and tune-ups.",How to Maintain Car Batteries,"


Most car batteries have a heavy-duty plastic case with two terminals to connect the positive and negative (ground) wires to the car. The terminals are usually made of lead or brass and can look like two thimbles. The terminals can also be two threaded screws or two threaded holes on the front of the battery. Take a picture before removing the cables to make sure the positive and negative cables do not get reversed.;
, You will likely have either a wet-cell battery or an Absorbed Glass Matt (AGM) battery. With an AGM battery, never attempt to open the battery. It is a good idea to only have a battery expert check the water levels in a maintenance-free battery-they rarely ever need water. For non-maintenance-free wet-cell batteries you can check the battery's water level every 2 or 3 months. The water should just touch the bottom of the battery's refill hole.


Pull up the fill caps on the battery to inspect the fluid level. Some batteries do not have fill caps because they are made so they do not need any water.
Refill the battery only with distilled water, if the level is low. Pour the water into the cell using a funnel. Do not overfill. Wait for the water to reach the bottom of the refill hole. Never overfill into the fill holes.

,


Remove the connectors from the battery terminal by moving them from side to side and gently pulling them up.
Rub the wire brush into a paste of baking soda mixed with distilled water. Gently scrub the terminal to achieve a shine and remove dried acid build-up.
Never use a rubber mallet to put terminals on a battery. Always use terminal spreaders to widen the terminal connectors opening to fit over the battery terminals.

, Applying the grease will protect the battery from rust and corrosion.

, Your mechanic will have a reliable method for testing your voltage. A fully charged battery will have a charge of 12.5 to 12.6 volts.


Take your car to an auto parts store for battery testing between visits to your regular mechanic. They can check the voltage and the charge for you, and offer you products that may help with your battery maintenance plan. Remember that a battery under 12.5 volts should never be tested until it reaches a fully charged level. A battery tester will often show ""Bad Battery"" if the battery is not fully charged even though the battery is perfectly good!

, Some cars include an insulator to protect the battery against very high temperatures, which can dry out its fluid quickly. The insulator should be in place and undamaged.

, The best way to maintain your battery and your entire car is to have it inspected and tested every 3,000 miles (4,800 km) or 3 months, whichever comes sooner.

Make sure you do not lose this screw down inside the distributor!
With the screw removed from the points, unplug the wire on the points that is going to the condenser (5).

,


Depending on the location of the condenser, you may need to loosen the distributor clamp and rotate the distributor to gain access to the small condenser screw.
If you do rotate the distributor, mark its location with thin line of white paint on the distributor body running down on the distributor clamp and the engine case, in order to be able to reinstall the distributor just as it was.

,


Make sure the ""post"" on the bottom side of the pickup unit fits firmly into the unthreaded hole in the breaker plate that held the points pivot shaft.
A little over an inch away from this unthreaded hole is the threaded hole that was used to secure the points. Use the 4 x 8 mm socket screw (8) and supplied Allen wrench to secure the module in the same threaded hole that the points screw was installed in.

,


Make sure you have slack in the wires inside the distributor.

The wires must not interfere with the operation of the magnetic trigger wheel (9) or vacuum advance mechanism.


Push the plastic grommet into the hole in the side of the distributor.

The grommet is designed to slightly pinch the wires to keep them from moving.
The square plastic grommet has the flange removed on one side. This side of the grommet must be located up in the direction of the distributor cap to avoid interference with the distributor cap when it is installed.



,


DO NOT REVERSE THE WIRES or the points replacement module will be destroyed when starting the vehicle.

,


Slide this ring down onto the distributor shaft; make sure it seats all the way down. It's a tight fit; apply some WD40 to a rag and wipe around the shaft to remove accumulated crud and to provide a little lubrication.
This ring properly sets the air gap (about 0.060"") between the CompuFire module and the magnetic trigger wheel. The gap must not be outside the range of 0.030” and 0.100”.

,


The wheel is indexed and will go onto the shaft correctly four ways.

Rotate it back and forth until you feel it “locate” onto the cam.


Once the trigger wheel is lined up properly, gently press it into place on the spacer ring.

It may be stiff the first few times; use the ignition rotor (3) as a tool to fully seat the trigger wheel onto the distributor cam.
If the trigger wheel is not pressed firmly onto the spacer ring, the gap between it and the CompuFire module may be too wide, and the system will not operate properly.



,


Depending on the ignition rotor, you might have to remove some material from the bottom of the rotor so it will seat properly onto the distributor shaft.
If not installed properly, the ignition rotor will spin freely on the shaft.

Take your vehicle for a test drive.",How to Install a Distributor," Park the vehicle in a safe, secure place (like a garage or a level stretch of ground) and open the hood to access the engine compartment. Look for the distributor - often, this is a cylindrical part with thick wires coming out of it that sits near the engine. Most distributors are located above ordinary V6 and V8 engines and to one side of inline V4 and V6 engines.


The distributor has a plastic cap with spark plug wires coming out of it. There will be one wire for each cylinder of the engine. There will also be one additional wire connected to the ignition coil.;
, Replacing the distributor requires you to use a timing light to set the timing of the engine after the new distributor is installed. To do this, you'll need to use the timing specifications unique to your vehicle. Often, these are on a sticker under the hood or in the engine compartment. You may also be able to find these in your vehicle's manual or online.


If you can't find the timing specifications for your vehicle, don't attempt to install a new distributor. In this case, it's much safer and easier to simply bring your vehicle to a qualified mechanic.

, As noted above, most distributors have a plastic cap from which the ignition wires emerge. To begin removing the distributor, remove this cap. This may or may not require basic tools - some caps have clamps that can be loosened by hand, while others may require screwdrivers or even socket wrenches to unscrew screws and/or bolts holding the cap in place.

, Before disconnecting each wire, mark it so that you'll be able to reconnect it in the same place in the new distributor. Electrical tape works well for this purpose - use the tape to give each wire a ""tag"" and, if you'd like, make notes on the tag with a marker.


As when working with any sort of electrical system, you'll want to use a healthy amount of common sense. Never tamper with a vehicle's electrical wires while the vehicle is running or any electrical current is flowing through the engine compartment.

, To make it a little easier to install the new distributor, it's a good idea to mark a location on the outside of the distributor housing where the distributor is mounted to the engine. Choose a spot for which you can find a corresponding location on the new distributor. This can make it simpler to line up the new distributor's housing with the engine mounting point (which you may also want to mark).

, This step is crucial - if the position of the rotor in your new distributor doesn't match the position of the rotor in your old distributor, your engine may not start with the new distributor installed. Carefully make a mark inside the distributor housing to indicate the position of the rotor. Be precise - the rotor in your new distributor will need to match this position exactly.

, Remove the bolts that hold the distributor housing to the engine. Carefully and delicately pull the distributor away from the engine. Note that it's easy to accidentally move the rotor when you remove the distributor - if this happens to you, use the position of the rotor that you originally marked as your reference point, not the position of the rotor after you remove the distributor.

, If you haven't already done so, remove your new distributor from its packaging. Make the same marks that you made on your old distributor on your new distributor. In other words, mark your old distributor's rotor position inside the housing of your new distributor and mark the location on the outside of the distributor that lines up with your engine's mounting point.

, As noted above, the position of the rotor in the new distributor must match the rotor position in the old distributor exactly or your vehicle won't be able to start. Ensure your rotor is lined up with the marking you made. As you install the distributor, take care not to accidentally move or nudge the rotor.

, Re-fasten the distributor in the same spot as the old distributor, lining up the marked location on the distributor housing with the engine mounting point. Re-screw any screws or bolts as needed to hold the distributor in place.


Don't tighten these fasteners all the way - you'll want to be able to move the distributor very slightly by hand.

, Connect each wire to the distributor according to the markings you made. Ensure that you fasten each wire in its correct place - each one should be re-attached in the location that corresponds to its original location on the old rotor.

, Double check all of your connections and attempt to start the vehicle. If the vehicle won't start, but sounds ""close"", try adjusting the position of the rotor a tiny amount (no greater than the width of the mark you made) and trying again. If the engine sounds less close to starting, adjust the rotor in the other direction. If it sounds closer to starting, continue to adjust it slightly in the same direction.


When you get the vehicle to start, allow it to ""warm up"" until it idles smoothly.

, Stop the engine and put a timing light on the #1 spark plug. Restart the engine. Adjust the timing by rotating the distributor housing by very small amounts. Be sure to follow the instructions specific to your vehicle which you located before replacing the distributor - as noted above, these instructions will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Don't leave this up to guesswork!


When you've adjusted your timing to the proper setting, tighten the fasteners you left slightly loose previously.

, You're all finished - test out your new distributor by putting your vehicles' engine through a variety of different accelerations. You may notice differences in the way your vehicle performs.


If anything about your vehicle's performance seems out of order, take your vehicle to a mechanic. Don't risk lasting damage by running your vehicle for long periods of time with distributor problems.

Obtain a manual, and check and it should have torquing instructions for bolts and compare their instructions to this and follow any recommendations about removal, installation and replacement instructions, pictures and diagrams that may be helpful.,

Avoid engine damage from the timing belt breaking or slipping, or the tensioner pulley or idler pulley locking up (seizing) or the timing belt skipping one or more cogs on a sprocket causing valve timing problems and possibly breaking valves, pistons and/or the engine cylinder (block):





 Diagram shows both halves of the timing covers, belt, a large thin washer behind the harmonic pulley is a guard for the crankshaft opening in the lower half timing cover, retaining bolt for the harmonic pulley.,Understand the numbering of the cylinders and label the spark plug cables and cylinders 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right but the other end is not that easy and carefully pry and get the cables off their spark plugs.,
Check your manual for firing order which will be 1, 3, 4, 2 or such for 1993--1997 (verify this carefully) and 1, 4, 3, 2 or such for after 1998 for how they plug onto the coil pack or distributor on older models.Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal so your engine can not be accidentally turned or started in error, you must remove the spark plugs before doing dangerous work.

,Drain all the coolant from the engine and keep it to use again or dispose of it legally; no matter how little.,
Remove both of the accessory belt(s) for the alternator and power steering, etc:

The older models with two belts have lock bolts on the tensioner bolts that must be loosened before you can turn the long tensioner bolt.,

Remove the bolts holding the power steering pump by unbolting the 3 bolts to release the power steering pump bracket from the engine (12mm and 14mm), but without opening or unsealing the power steering hoses or you will need to drain it and refill it when finished.,
Loosen the long bolt of alternator pivoting bracket on the alternator belt; so it will allow the adjustable accessory to pivot as tension is released, loosen the tensioner enough to remove the belt.,Follow serpentine belt instructions in your operator manual and see their diagram for that kind of belt, if so equipped on newer models.","How to Change the Water Pump on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20041"," The owner/operator guide omits such repairs. The factory Mazda, OEM, repair manuals do not explain in detail for a beginner and advise use of unnecessary tools. (The tools needed will be mentioned in each step.) Check the manuals and see which of these cars used this same engine -- some up to 2004.

Caution: Use the ""smallest workable ratchet, breakover wrench and/or cheater leverage extension"" correctly to not over tighten (over torque) bolts and avoid breaking off a bolt or screw (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").
You actually might have to remove the engine to extract a broken bolt when you do the reassembly if you break off a screw or bolt in a tight spot for instance.

,

Change the timing belt, timing belt tensioner and its idler pulley.
Caution: this is an interference engine meaning that the valves and pistons will come into contact, interfere and damage or ruin the engine in case (if) the timing belt were to break or slips on cam(s) sprockets or the crankshaft sprocket (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").

,,,, You will need to loosen the lock bolts a turn or more and then loosen the tensioner a good number of turns until you can get enough slack to remove the belts.

,
This will help get some working space, where it is difficult to loosen and tighten the lock bolt on the power steering tensioner with a combination wrench (14mm) even by switching ends of the wrench. Do not pry belts off or on., The older models do have two flat belts (not v-belts) and the newer models probably have a single serpentine belt.

Do not pry or force the belts to get them off; you will probably need it all loosened even more to get the new tighter belts on anyway.

Avoid panicking and pull over as soon as you can.,

Leave the radiator cap on until it is cool.,
Turn the radiator cap.,
Check your coolant reservoir tank once the engine has cooled enough.,

Turn the car back on after cooling and check the temperature gauge.,
Call a tow-truck if the issue doesn't go away or you notice bigger problems.",How to Cool an Overheated Engine1," An overheating engine, while serious, will not cause you immediate harm. If your temperature gauge hits the red or you notice steam coming from your engine, slow down and pull over as soon as you find somewhere safe. If you notice white clouds coming from your engine, it is not smoke but steam that is coming off an overheated engine, and you have some time to pull over. If you cannot immediately pull over, you should:


Turn off the AC and open the windows.
Crank the heat and fans all the way up--this draws heat from your engine.
Turn on your hazards and drive at a slow, constant pace until you can stop.;
, If the car isn't too hot, turn off the vehicle and pop your hood. If the hood is extremely hot to the touch or if you see steam, then it is advisable to wait until the hood cools before you open it all the way. Opening the hood helps dissipate some of the heat away from the engine.


Turn the engine off and leave the key in the ignition in the ""on"" position. Your lights, dashboard, etc., should still be on. This will allow the cooling fans to continue running without running your engine, which will help speed the cooling process.
Let the engine cool completely before you touch the engine or open the radiator cap. This cooling process could take as long as 30-45 minutes, but will save you from dangerous burns., Squeezing the upper radiator hose can help you determine whether your system is under pressure, and thus whether it's safe to remove the radiator cap. If it feels firm and is difficult to squeeze, then the system is likely still pressurized and you should not remove the radiator cap. If the hose compresses easily when you squeeze it, it is probably safe to remove the radiator cap.


Use a rag or towel when you handle this hose, as it can be very hot.

, The pressure and steam inside can shoot a dangerous jet of fluid back at your face. Play it safe and leave the radiator cap on the car for as long as you can. If it feels warm to the touch, leave it.An overheated engine may have coolant as hot as 260F. Inside a sealed system, it will not boil. However, once exposed to the air it will flash boil and can cause severe burns. Wait until the system is cool.

, Use a thick towel or rag to turn the cap carefully. The cap will expose the fluid inside the radiator or expansion tank to the atmosphere. If your radiator cap doesn't have threads, you will need to push down on it after you've loosened it in order to clear the safety lock. This will allow you to remove the cap completely.

, This usually takes 30-45 minutes. The reservoir tank resembles a white, plastic milk jug and is connected to the radiator cap. There is usually a mark on the side that lets you know how full it should be.

, The most common cause of engine overheating is a leak in the coolant system. Look for fluid on the engine or pooling underneath the car, especially if the coolant is low or empty. That said, cooling systems need pressure to function, so even a small leak that hasn't drained a lot of coolant can cause problems.Coolant usually smells sweet, and can show up on hoses, under the car, or around the radiator cap. It flows more like water, unlike oil which has a thicker consistency.
Coolant is often green for older models, but the color of coolant can vary depending on your car's make and model.

, If you have coolant, add some to the car once it has cooled down, usually after 30-45 minutes. Open the radiator cap and pour a little in, 3-5 seconds worth. If you have water, mix the coolant and water together in roughly even parts and add that -- most engines are made to function with a 50/50 mixture of coolant and water.In a tight pinch, just water can substitute for coolant, though you don't want to use it for too long.

, Is it shooting back up into the red? If so, you should turn the car back off and wait another 10-15 minutes for it to cool off before driving. If not, you should be able to keep driving until you see a mechanic.

, If you have a leak in the coolant system, are dripping oil, or can't get the engine to cool down, call a tow-truck immediately. Engine overheating can completely ruin a motor, totaling your car if you aren't careful.


If you must drive the car, be sure to let it cool as much as possible before restarting.

Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.,
Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.,Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.,
Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but ""finger-tight"" (snug).,
Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot).,
Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again.","How to Change the Water Pump on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20042"," One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now ""found"" under that hose.
, Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.

Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.

,, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.,
With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little ""bump"" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a ""remote push-button starter switch"" or by wiggling the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.

Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.
Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor ""bump.""

, It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.

Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally ""bumped"" or turned away from TDC (top dead center) by the starter motor in error.

Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).,Remove the lower timing cover carefully because you have to maneuver it to clear off of the sort of alignment pin-block (actually almost a little cube and is about 2cm) and is just above the crankshaft sprocket and fits into a place in the lower half cover but you can not see it until the cover is off.","How to Change the Water Pump on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20043"," Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them.

Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).

,""); so then align it as explained next.
Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head.
The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (""top of the compression stroke"").
Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the ""number one spark plug hole"" by a ""compression gauge"" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.
Required: securely place a ""plastic/rubber"" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably ""not real cork"" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the ""rubber stop-block."" Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will ""turn"" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two ""open-end"" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).

, Put on the parking brake.,, Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only.,, Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,"

Begin removing the motor mount by unbolting the 7 bracket bolts (17mm = 11/16 inch) with a strong breakover wrench with a cheater pipe on its handle to get more leverage and remove an 8th bolt which is the longer bolt that passes through the middle of the lumpy looking metal-rubber mount also.,Find the ""seventh"" bracket bolt if not yet removed which was uncovered when you lifted out the heavy lump-like middle part of the mount.,Remove the huge, oddly shaped motor mount bracket carefully from among the air conditioning hoses and power steering hoses by pulling them back ""just a little,"" and yet do not damage the wiring and hoses.,

Add water to the radiator if you are out of coolant.,
Drive for short stretches, turn the car off, and repeat if you need to keep moving.,
Know that you will likely need to go to the mechanic if your car chronically overheats.",How to Cool an Overheated Engine2," You do not, however, want to keep driving for long if you can help it. That said, sometimes you have no choice but to keep moving until you can get to help.If the car does not overheat again, you may have had a one-time overheating due to a variety of factors (AC on, hot day, stop and start traffic). Still, you need to keep your eyes on the temperature gauge whenever possible to avoid more issues.
Most cars are calibrated to sense overheating before serious engine damage, giving you some time to fix the problem. This does not, however, mean you should ignore your gauges., Air conditioning uses engine power to cool off the car, and you don't need your engine under any more strain than it can handle. Open the windows to cool off instead.

, While this seems counter-intuitive, cars heaters warm up by sucking heat made by the engine and blasting it into the car. Thus, turning your fans and heat to the highest settings will pull hot air out of the engine and cool the car. It may, however, get a little uncomfortable.


Turn the vents to point out the window to prevent things from getting too hot in the cab.Alternately, you can set the heat to the ""defroster"" setting to avoid it blowing directly on you.

, Get yourself up to 2000 rpms with the car in neutral. This helps the engine and the fan circulate air quicker, getting cool air and coolant to the engine and helping you remove some heat from the car. If you're in stop/start traffic, this could be a great way to keep the engine moving when the car can't., Though not recommended for long drives, water will help keep your engine cool in a pinch. Add warm water to your radiator, but only after the engine has cooled. Cool water can cause a crack in your engine block due to the extreme change in temperature., If you absolutely must drive with an overheating engine, keep your eye on the temperature gauge. Every time it gets hot, pull over, turn the car off, and wait for 10-20 minutes as it cools. This is not great for the engine, but it is better than trying to drive through it and causing a total meltdown., If your car keeps overheating, has a leak, or cannot start, you need to see a mechanic. Even if these tips help you ""deal"" with overheating when it occurs, there is likely a larger issue that needs to be fixed before a major meltdown.

Drive at a slow and steady pace instead of stopping and starting in traffic.,
Use the windows, instead of the AC, when to cool the car.,
Change your oil regularly and have your fan checked simultaneously.,
Top off your coolant at the beginning of summer.,
Keep an emergency kit in your car for overheating issues.",How to Cool an Overheated Engine3," Stopping and starting puts stress on the engine that can cause it to overheat, especially in older cars. Ease off the break and let your car roll forward slowly, knowing that you will likely have to stop again when you reach the next car's bumper anyway.Making checking your temperature gauge a regular habit at red lights and stop signs.

, The AC uses engine power to cool the air in the car, putting extra strain on the engine. The first thing you should do when overheating is to turn off the AC, but you should avoid using it at all if you fear your car might overheat for any reason.


If you are very late for an inspection, find a leak in your radiator, have unresolved AC issues, or are low on coolant, try not to use the AC at all., Old oil can lead to overheating, especially when coupled with low coolant or other issues. Whenever you get your car's oil changed, ask the mechanics to look at your fan as well -- spotting an issue now can save you a costly fix later on.


You should hear your fan whirring after you've turned you car off, as it is still working to cool your car off., Check your coolant reservoir and make sure that the levels are still where they need to be as indicated on the sides. If they are a little low, mix equal parts coolant and water and add it to the recommended level. This is especially important if you live in hot areas.When checking the coolant, take 2-3 minutes to search for any leaks as well. Coolant is usually green and smells sweet. Check under the car, around the engine, and on any hoses or radiator parts that you can see.

, You don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with an engine you can't use. A simple preparedness kit will help keep you and your car safe, especially if you need to keep driving to get to a mechanic. You should pack:Extra coolant.
A gallon of water.
A tool-kit.
A flashlight.
Non-perishable food.
A blanket.
A straight razor blade.
Duct tape.

 Keeping the stop block in place to hold the sprockets aligned, Start the belt part way onto the ""crankshaft pulley sprocket"" and going counter-clockwise being certain to place the belt without slack onto the left of the idler pulley and across the tops of the ""cam sprockets"" and use the Allen Wrench to rotate the tensioner toward counterclockwise to get the belt on to the right of the tensioner, and work the belt the rest of the way onto the sprockets and both pulleys.,
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide on to the sprockets.,With the Allen wrench in the hole in tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.,
Remove the ""stopper block"" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.","How to Change the Water Pump on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20045",",,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its left of the correct one) and find and then loosen the water pump. Loosen it from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet hammer but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.,, Tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, ie: breaking one off. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with ""gasket cement."" Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.

Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage ways in the engine or radiator.

, Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley,,,

Put on the ""new timing belt""; follow instructions that came with it. (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench can be used to budge the cam slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper ""jammed"" (in to hold the sprockets) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on right. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them., While holding that hex wrench begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way.,,

Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.

Clear away any tools, etc.,Reconnect the battery negative cable.,Check for coolant leaks, check all other fluids, and leave the radiator cap off temporarily to recheck so you can top-off the coolant level after starting the engine.,Let it idle while finishing filling with coolant and put on the radiator cap, and be sure that the car is otherwise road worthy.","How to Change the Water Pump on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20046",",,, Put the big bolt back with the washer/disk and tighten it securely.

Tighten and torque the harmonic crankshaft pulley bolt while you hold the pulley with a bar between bolts placed in the ""puller bolt holes"" of the pulley, or as best you can hold it without damaging it, and torque it to about 115 feet (35.1 m) lbs..

, Use the large ratchet or medium sized ratchet (3/8 inch) with a cheater extension to tighten the motor mount bracket securely and also to reinstall the other parts of the motor mount later (before you remove the jacks).,,,

You will need to pull a little on the hoses and move the wiring around to work the big mount bracket into its place and yet not damage the wiring and hoses. It's tricky, so be patient.

,, Almost finished., and then refill the coolant system and refill the overflow tank, bounce the car on the side where it is not on the jack and add more coolant; do that a few more times. Check for coolants leaks., before starting the engine.,,,"

Find both of your radiator hoses.,
Visually inspect each radiator hose.,
Perform a squeeze test.,
Check the clamps that connect the hose to the radiator and the engine.",How to Check Radiator Hoses," One reason radiator hoses are overlooked during a routine car inspection is that the hoses can be difficult to reach.


The upper radiator hose runs from the radiator to the motor. You can usually see most of this hose.
The lower radiator hose is harder to find. To locate it, get underneath the car and look for a smaller diameter hose leading from the radiator into the heat wall of the car.;
, Hoses should not be swollen or cracked, both of which could lead to a failure.

, While the engine is warm after a drive, squeeze the radiator hoses, paying particular attention to areas where the hose bends.


A radiator hose in good condition should feel firm, but not hard.
A radiator hose in poor condition feels very hard, spongy, or soft. You may find a single soft spot as opposed to the entire hose being soft. A soft hose or a hose with a soft spot should be replaced.

, There are 3 different types of radiator hose connections, gear clamps, banded clamps and wire clamps.


Gear clamps, which are sometimes called worm clamps, and banded clamps, which are also called screw clamps, are typically made of stainless steel and wrap around the hose. You adjust these types of clamps with a screwdriver.
Wire clamps are adjusted with a pair of hose clamp pliers. You can recognize these clamps because there is no screw keeping them tight.

This will release pressure on the cooling system and prevent vacuum lock when draining., If you feel a crunching sensation when you squeeze the hoses you probably have rust in the cooling system. The system will need to be flushed before filling with new coolant. There are kits to do this at your local auto part store, but if you would rather, you can do it yourself.

, It is imperative that you contain and control all coolant that you drain from your vehicle. Aside from being damaging to the environment, the coolant is highly toxic to humans and animals. Its sweet taste and smell make it attractive to children and pets and can result in serious injury or death., You can use your hands or a pair of pliers to turn the pet cock. This will open it and allow coolant to drain into your drip pan., If you felt rust or if your coolant seems dirty, now is the appropriate time to flush your coolant. If you are unfamiliar with the procedure you can refer to Flush a Radiator.

, Liquids from the flush will also contain coolant. These liquids are considered hazardous waste and must not be poured into the ground. Check with your local recycling and waste management facilities for disposal options., This will require you to loosen the hose clamps. You do this by using a hose clamp remover or a pair of channel locks to squeeze the ends of the hose clamp together. Once the ends are together, the clamp should be loose enough to slide up the radiator hose, allowing you to remove the hose from the radiator.Some older models may have a screw type clamp. For this you will need a socket or screwdriver to twist the screw on the hose clamp. Counterclockwise should loosen and clockwise should tighten the clamp.

, In some cars, there may be a transmission fluid cooler built into the radiator. If there are metal lines running to the radiator from the transmission, they will need to be removed using a wrench. There should be two lines. Also, be careful to catch the transmission fluid that leaks when you disconnect these lines.These will be a set of two metal lines running into the bottom of the radiator. Do not bend or kink these lines.
Be aware that the transmission fluid is also toxic and should be appropriately disposed of.

, Locate and disconnect the fan motor electrical connector. This is usually the only electrical connection, but double check to make sure.

, The air conditioner condenser is often connected to the radiator. To remove the radiator, you will need to remove the condenser mounting bolts with a wrench. This allows the condenser to stay in the engine bay and keeps the refrigerant system closed.The condenser mounting bolts are usually near the top corners of the radiator. You will not need to unhook any lines or hoses from the condenser.

, Look at how your radiator is attached to your car. Usually there are braces bolted to the frame on top, and the bottom rests on rubber feet within an indentation., There should be no hoses, electrical connectors, and it should have sufficient clearance to be removed. If not, study the layout and think before disassembling anything else. Some other components may need to be removed like a top engine mount or the battery tray, but usually the radiator is held in only by the mounting brackets., Once the radiator is out, you will need to look for any parts that need to be transferred over to the new radiator. This might include the fan shroud assembly, brackets, or other parts. Remove any such parts before recycling the radiator., Any parts that were removed from the old radiator, such as brackets, fan shroud, etc., need to be installed on the new radiator before it goes into the car., It will simply lower (or raise) into the same space that you took the old radiator out of. This part is fairly easy, but be cautious. If you bend the fins of the radiator you will need to straighten them out with a radiator comb to ensure proper airflow and cooling., Lower or fit the radiator into the support track. Align the radiator with any mounting tabs, including any rubber mouldings between the radiator and the support rack. Tighten the mounting bracket bolts to secure the radiator in the engine bay., Use the same condenser mounting bolts that your removed from the old radiator. Align the condenser so that the bolts fit into the radiator and screw them in with a wrench or ratchet., This will restore power to your electric fan (if your car has an electric fan). If there are any other electrical components with your radiator, this will restore power to them as well., This will ensure that your transmission keeps cool, and that transmission fluid isn’t leaked. Be sure not to cross thread these fittings, as that might result in a poor seal and leaking transmission fluid. Tighten with a wrench.It is likely that there will be gaskets that fit between these lines and the radiator. Be sure that the gasket did not get left on your old radiator.

, This will complete your cooling system and allow coolant to flow into and out of your radiator. Slide the hoses onto their respective fittings at the top and bottom of the radiator. Then use a pair of channel locks to move the hose clamps up into place. This holds the hoses to the radiator snuggly., You will need to consult your owner’s manual or service manual for proper coolant specifications., You can purchase pre-diluted coolant, or use distilled water to dilute the coolant. This allows the coolant to function properly, so be sure that you are diluting to the correct concentrations. This is usually a one to one dilution (half water, half coolant)., You should pour directly into the radiator until you see the fluid near the top, and then fill the reservoir tank to the cold fill line. You may need to add additional coolant once the engine circulates what you add., Some cars require a specific routine to bleed air pockets out of the cooling system. Check your service manual for details on how to do this properly., This closes off your system and allows it to build pressure. You have now changed your radiator."

Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.

,, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.,
With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little ""bump"" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a ""remote push-button starter switch"" or by wiggling the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.

Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.
Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor ""bump.""
Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.
Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally ""bumped"" or turned away from TDC (top dead center) by the starter motor in error.

,""); so then align it as explained next.
Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head.
The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (""top of the compression stroke"").
Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the ""number one spark plug hole"" by a ""compression gauge"" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.
Required: securely place a ""plastic/rubber"" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably ""not real cork"" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the ""rubber stop-block.""

Look for a leak in the cooling system.,
Determine whether to drive on or call for help.",How to Stop an Engine from Overheating1," As soon as you notice the temperature gauge creeping into the ""H"" territory (which stands for ""hot""), pull over and turn off your car to allow the engine to cool. Be extra aware of the temperature gauge on hot days.


If you start to see steam emanating from your hood, stop immediately. You may be able to prevent serious steam from escaping in the first place by keeping an eye on your temperature gauge.;
, Don't keep all that heat trapped up there. Find the little latch underneath the hood and open the hood. Be aware that some cars have safety latches close to radiator cap and there is a risk of getting burned if steam is coming from radiator cap.

, Doing so is very likely to release a high pressure combination of steam and radiator fluid that can cause very serious burns.

, Most modern cars have a plastic reservoir of coolant connected to the top of the radiator. This will allow you to see if your coolant is low. Many have marks indicating the proper level of coolant, below which the engine is in danger of becoming too hot. Check to see if the coolant is at or below that level.


Add coolant (or water, in a pinch) to your reservoir to the full/hot line. On most cars, you can add liquid to your reservoir even if the car is hot. Check the owner's manual to be sure, or wait for the car to cool before opening.






If your car only has a radiator and no coolant reservoir, you must wait for it to cool before checking the level of coolant.







, If your radiator or cylinder head seem to be compromised, or if you open the coolant reservoir and the levels are topped up, you may have a leak in the cooling system. If you're experienced with cars, check the radiator, core plugs in the engine block, or cylinder head near the head gasket for any signs of leakage.


If you don't know your way around cars, consider bringing your car to the nearest mechanic and ask them to pressure-test the cooling system. Pressure-testing the cooling system is relatively easy to do; they may even do it free of charge., If the car was simply low on coolant and you were able to refill it, it may be safe to drive on. Follow the instructions below for how to minimize the risk of overheating if you do so.

If the car appears to be out of coolant entirely, do not drive it. You can quickly cause severe harm to your engine by doing so.






If help is readily available, you may be better off calling for a tow truck than driving the car.






If no help is available or conditions are otherwise unsafe you may need to drive on regardless of whether you were able to solve the problems. Read below for how to manage your car if this is the case.

Turn the air conditioning off.,
Use the heater to disperse engine heat.,
Keep a close eye on the temperature gauge or light.,
Turn off your engine (under certain circumstances), but flip your key back into ""ignition"" as soon as it stops.,
Keep it steady in stop-and-go traffic.,
Wait out rush hour traffic.",How to Stop an Engine from Overheating2," If your car has air conditioning, turn it off. Air-conditioning puts a load on the engine that you want to avoid right now.

, It may sound crazy, but it actually works. Flip the climate controls to vent, turn the heater all the way up, and turn the fan all the way up. If the weather is hot, the inside of the car will heat up quite a lot. Point the vents out the windows as much as possible to help reduce the temperature.


Why this works: The heater in your car uses engine heat to warm air in the cabin. Running your heater full blast takes a significant amount of heat away from the engine, making it significantly cooler., Pull over and turn off the engine if you have to. Remember that if your car overheats too much, it will ruin the engine.

, The engine will shut down, but both the radiator fan and blower will keep cooling down coolant. Do this only if you are sitting in traffic or stopped at a light and not moving for more than a minute. Keep a lookout ahead for when the traffic will move and turn your engine on before that point.

, It is better to move at a steady slow pace than to go fast, stop, go fast stop, etc. Accelerating quickly and then riding the brake will increase the load put on the engine, causing it to work overtime.


Generally, people will not cut you off in stop and go traffic since everyone is stuck in the same situation. Either way, you probably want to be more worried about your engine overheating than someone getting in ahead of you.







, Pull over if you think your car will break down in stop and go traffic. Turn off the engine and wait for the traffic to start moving normally. Once the traffic starts flowing again, it is better for you to drive faster than slower as more air will come in and cool your engine.

Try the auto shop for preventive maintenance.,
Save yourself from duplicate labor charges.,
Don't ignore warning signs––try to fix things while they're still small problems.,
Adopt a do-it-yourself approach.,
Use Internet shopping for some parts Some websites sell you parts at extremely competitive prices.,
Find a cheap ding repair shop.",How to Save Money on Car Maintenance," For this, you must read the Owner’s Manual. Reading the 'Scheduled Maintenance Guide' can help you familiarize yourself with your car. It informs you about the time when your auto transmission car needs maintenance, according to the manufacturer. Go through the car manual thoroughly, to know about the best time and place to spend limited dollars on your car's maintenance.


Knowing the scheduled dates will help you to negotiate and budget better, as you won't be at the whim of the mechanic telling you car parts are due for maintaining, changing or updating well before the time the manufacturer recommends.;
, Always take your car to a well-known auto transmission repair shop for maintenance.


Ask your friends, family and co-workers about a shop or mechanic that they know and trust.
Search for local auto repair shops that specialize in auto car, van or pick-up truck maintenance. Being local, you'll find they're more invested in keeping a good reputation among their local community and there will be many locals who can vouch for the quality.

, Make a visit first, to see what your impression is. Make sure that the auto shop has a clean floor. Check that they use clean rags, clear away empty containers or other trash from the floor and generally looks well organized. This will indicate that the mechanics take pride in their work and maintain a well-run repairs shop.

,


Staff ought to be certified with Automotive Service Excellence( ASE). In case the staff is not certified, they must have some specific training regarding auto repairs; don't be afraid to ask to see it.

, If you have a list of repairs you need doing on a particular day, ask the repairs shop which services are most important, so as to make your list less long and more affordable. Do your calculations and go for the services your car requires the most. You can also consult your experienced friend for the estimate.


Before getting the service, find out a rough figure of what the usual car service charges in your area for the same service. Browse through an online search engine to find out quotes from various helpful websites. There are websites in some areas which can provide you with a list of fair price shops according to your zip code. Such websites can provide you with the information and estimates for common repairs on the car in your local area.
The best way to test an auto transmission repairs shop is to go there when your car needs an oil change and oil filter. By doing this, you can also clarify any queries which have arisen after reading your car's maintenance manual.
If you have a long list of maintenance services that your car requires, make sure that you get it done in alignment with your car's current mileage, so that the car is kept in the best condition possible according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Choose from lowest to highest prices as per your pocket; there is no need to loiter here and there to find the perfect auto transmission servicing.

, To reach the innermost part causing a problem, sometimes the mechanic has to remove many other parts. You can save money by repairing this part before it causes further trouble. For instance, to repair a squealing drive belt, the mechanic may need to change the upper and lower radiator, hoses and water pump and thermostat, because all this has to be removed in order to reach the drive belt. If you have good negotiation skills, you can save money by negotiating on the labor charges and get the whole lot done at the same time, for less.

, Your vehicle gives you many signals when it needs a repairs. For example, sometimes the light flashes because the fuel filler cap is not properly placed. You can check this yourself by removing the fuel filler cap. See whether the gasket or rubber is in the right place or not. Now, replace the cap firmly. Now when you restart the engine and flashing light has gone, it means that the problem was with the cap; once fixed, you are good to go and potentially bigger, costlier problems have been averted.


When you start the engine, if the check-engine lights comes on, get it checked quickly. It might be normal but sometimes it means something quite serious, so there is a risk involved in driving a car without getting it checked. Engine damage is costly, so the more you delay, the costlier the end result may become.
If the check-engine light flashes on and off, get your car towed to your trusted auto transmission repair shop or bear the (costlier) damage caused by it in future. Never ignore the flashing check-engine lights.

, Some jobs are easy and can be done alone. If you can learn how to change air filters or wiper blades, you can save those dollars you would give to the mechanic for performing this little service on your vehicle. Choose the correct wiper blades or air filters for your vehicle by consulting a local parts person.

, You can order many expensive parts at affordable prices by following some particular websites that offer various deals. You can also check if shipping of these items is free or do they imply any sales tax. Compare local prices with prices on Internet, and go for a reasonable purchase. There's no harm in trying out.


Ask your repairs shop if they are happy to accept your own-purchased parts rather than using their suggested parts. Use their labor but your online shopping savvy, to save money.

, It is inevitable that over time your vehicle will end up with a few dings, dents and chips. An auto-repair shop will sand down all the dented or chipped components; alternatively, repairing and repainting the whole thing will cost you a great deal. Check for a reasonable dent repairing shop instead, one that fixes used cars, and you'll save money by getting cheap dent repairs.

;
, This is the least abrasive measure for taking care of fine scratches. Sometimes it is all that is needed to get rid of a scratch.








, Auto detailing solution can be used, but acetone products, such as nail polish remover, work just as well. Moisten a clean, white cloth with acetone and wipe it lightly over the scratch. Continue applying the acetone until the scrape or scratch vanishes.








, If the scratch does not disappear after applying the acetone, get some car rubbing compound and a buffing pad. The car rubbing compound can be found at any auto parts or body detailing store.








, Saturate sandpaper with water and rub it carefully over the affected area. Wet sanding will remove the scratches and any other imperfections by using the heavier grit of the sandpaper against the lighter grit in the paint.









Use an ultra fine sandpaper, preferably a 2,000 to 3,000 grit wet/dry sandpaper when sanding. Add two or three drops of liquid dish soap to the water before wetting the sandpaper to make the water a little more slippery. This will help to improve the sanding.

, Dust away any debris or dust from the buffing and the sanding.








,


Apply car wax or polish again if you used more abrasive methods. Using products such as acetone, buffing compound, and sandpaper will remove protective wax and sealers, as well as scratches and scrapes. Use any brand of wax or polish that is usually used on the car and lightly cover the paint with it.

If your A/C system uses an accumulator, you'll find it at the evaporator outlet.






You'll find the receiver-drier in systems that use an expansion valve to control refrigerant flow. It's connected to the high-pressure liquid line, between the condenser and the expansion valve.






Make sure that your desiccant is compatible with R-134a refrigerant., Do this even if you don't think that you need to replace them so that you don't have to do it later if they don't seal.


When you remove an old O-ring, tape it to a piece of paper. Write down exactly where that O-ring came from and keep the papers for a while.






If you have a leak at a connection, grab the O-ring that you took replaced. Double-check to make sure that you replaced the old O-ring with a new O-ring that was the right size. Most A/C leaks are caused by O-rings that aren't properly installed., The hoses that you used with the R-12 refrigerant should work as long as they aren't cracked or damaged. If they are damaged, replace them.

, When your system pressure gets too high, the cutout switch will shut off the compressor to keep from damaging your A/C parts and to prevent the system from venting refrigerant., You'll find this tube connected to the high-pressure side at or near the evaporator. In some cases, you may find it in the condenser outlet. Don't try to clean an orifice tube. You'll need to replace it instead.

, Make sure to use the viscosity recommended in your car's operating manual.,, Doing this will puncture the top of the can.

, The refrigerant will push air out of the hose so that it doesn't get into your air conditioning system.

, Connect the other end of the service hose to the low service fitting on the air conditioner.

, You only want vapor to be pulled into your A/C.

, The gauge will help you to make sure that your recharge is accurate.

, Turn the air conditioner on its maximum setting.

, The extraction may take up to 10 minutes. The air blowing from your car vents should grow gradually colder.

, When the gauge reads 225 to 250 PSI, close the valve on your refrigerant can. Always close the valve before disconnecting the can so that you don't spray refrigerant into the atmosphere.


Generally, your A/C will take in about 12 ounces (355 ml) of refrigerant.
If your system isn't fully charged after your refrigerant can is depleted, then you can add another can of refrigerant until your gauge reads in the right PSI range., Refrigerant doesn't go bad, so you can use what remains in the can another time. Just make sure to store it in a cool place so that the can doesn't overheat and explode. You can also look into selling refrigerant back to a reclaiming facility or to a certified technician.

, Doing this will prevent cross-contamination of refrigerant, and it is required by federal law.

Jack both front wheels off the ground and support the vehicle with jack stands. Chock the back tires to make sure nothing will move anywhere while you're working.;
, Figure out if your vehicle's got a strut-style suspension or a control arm, then check the ball joint by either jacking up the control arm near the ball joint to check for wheel play, or by jacking up the car and using a pry-bar to check for wheel play in a strut-style suspension.


There should be no space between the ball joint and the point of contact. If you see any space, or the wheel moves considerably, the joint needs to be replaced.

, Go to the auto parts store and get a replacement part appropriate for your make and model. All you've got to know is the type of vehicle and you should be able to use the guidebook in the aisle, or ask for help and they'll be able to direct you.


Typically, a solid ball joint replacement will run about $80 or $90 new. Compared to the several hundred to a thousand dollars they'll charge at the shop, this can be a very cost-effective DIY project.

, Depending on the steering assembly, you may also have to move aside the brakes. If so, use a wire to hang the brakes and don’t dangle them by the brake lines. You'll also need to loosen the mounts holding the control arm or sway bar in place to give you more room to move suspension parts away.


If it's at all possible, try to work around the brake rotor, caliper, and the line without removing the assembly. If you do, you'll have to bleed the brakes, making this a much bigger job.

, The ball joints can be some of the gunkiest components on the entire undercarriage, quite caked with dirt and other road grit, and it can be a bear trying to get the ball joint loose from that build-up. To make it easier on yourself, spray some metal cleaner on all the bolts to try to get them to slip off somewhat more easily., The top should look like a crown, or castle, at the bottom. Leave the castellated nut in place, just a few turns in to keep it in a safe place.


If you’re working on a McPherson strut suspension remove the “pinch bolt” that clamps the ball joint stud.

, The goal is to try to guide it through the hole in the upper half of the steering knuckle. It can be somewhat difficult because of the extremely tight fit which helps hold the ball joint in place and the road grime built up around the suspension, so you will most likely need to use a hammer and a special tool called a “pickle fork” or tie rod separator to get enough leverage to maneuver.With the wrench, remove the largest nut from the joint, replace with the new nut, and then drive the pickle fork between the control arm and the steering knuckle. You'll probably have to hammer it, and don't be afraid to get rough.This will probably ruin the gasket around the ball joint, so make sure you've got one to replace it.
By putting the castellated nut on before hammering away, you'll avoid having the ball joint pop completely out and drop onto the floor, or more likely your foot.

, Loosen bolts or drill out rivets holding the ball joint in place, and slide out the ball joint. Sometimes, it's helpful to heat particularly corroded components with a torch to try to loosen them. Be careful if you try this.


If your auto’s suspension uses pressed-in ball joints, you’ll need to remove the lower control arm and take the assembly to a mechanic with a hydraulic press, who can press the old ball joint out and the new ball joint in.

, Slide the new rubber boot over the ball joint’s stud and guide the new ball joint back up through the steering knuckle hole, where it came from.

, It's not usually advisable to re-use old bolts or rubber boots that covered the old ball joint, which will probably be too corroded if the ball joint wore out.

, Refer to the manufacturer’s service manual and use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts and castellated nut to specified levels; reinstall the pinch bolt if working on a McPherson strut.


Generally, the specs will be about 44 pounds per foot on the screws and around 80 for other bolts. Always defer to the owner's manual for accurate numbers, however.

, If you removed the brake or wheel, reattach them and lower the vehicle back down to test out the action. Bleed the brakes, if necessary. It's a good opportunity to do any other repairs you might need to do with the brakes, since you've got them off.


Replacing a ball joint can affect alignment. If a ball joint is worn enough, and the vehicle was previously aligned, it might be wise have the vehicle realigned.

In most cars, the VIN is located on the driver’s side dashboard and is visible through the window, but it may also be located on a rear wheel well or the front of the engine block, in the trunk or door jam, or on the frame of the car between the carburetor and windshield washer.


If you’re not sure where your VIN is on your vehicle you can also look up the number on your car insurance information. It should be in the top left hand corner of each page.;
, Regardless of which option you pursue to get a new set of car keys you're going to need to find out this information. This information will let you know the specific kind of key that you need to open your vehicle. Remember, keys are supposed to be unique!

, This should be your first option. They generally they will give you the best deal on a new key, about half as much as it would cost to get a new key from your manufacturer or dealer. Normally they don’t charge to visit the car either. They’ll open your car and then proceed to make you a new key. While hardware stores aren’t generally equipped to create new car keys (as opposed to simply copying them), locksmiths usually have more sophisticated machinery. The older your vehicle, the better the odds that a locksmith will be able to help you with a replacement key. If you lost a key fob, a good locksmith may be able to help you make a new one – depending on how sophisticated the key was. Additionally, they should be able to help you reprogram the replacement key, though your manual may also have instructions on how to do that. Be sure to bring any other key fobs associated with that vehicle with you, as they sometimes won’t work until the new key is programmed. Some cars require specialized equipment to program keys that locksmiths and dealers have. , After market keys or even factory replacements can sometimes be found online for less than it would cost you to get them direct from the manufacturer. You may have success with a reputable dealer on eBay, but otherwise look for companies intended specifically to replace car keys. Again, the older the vehicle and simpler the key, the easier it will be to replace. Amazon is a good place to start. Although be aware some cars require specialized equipment to cut and program. Call around to see who would be willing to cut and program a key bought online before you purchase one. Also compare programming charges with the cost of a whole new one from the locksmith.

Hope for the best!

, Depending on the sophistication of your car key you may be able to have a new electronic key programmed by a locksmith. Many new car keys have a microchip in them to prevent duplication. However, if you have a key with a transponder in it you can probably get a new one at a locksmith for $50.00 - $120.00 depending on your car and your area.. Manufacturers started using transponders in the 1990’s – they are chips in the head of the key that communicate with the car. If the wrong key is in the ignition, the car will not start. Transponder keys are available at locksmiths,, Search for ‘aftermarket electronic car keys’ on the Internet and you’ll find plenty of options for replacement electronic car keys. Oftentimes you’ll be able to get a new car key for 75 % less than what the dealer would charge you. But you still need to get it cut and programmed so be sure to check prices for that in your area before you purchase anything.

, This will cost you upwards of $200. However, if you just want a key that you know will work and you want to get it quickly and easily this is not a bad option. Visit your local dealer – if it’s a Honda, go to a Honda dealership, if it's a Ford go to a Ford dealership, etc..

, Sometimes you can program them to your specific car without a special technician. The instructions are usually included with the new key, but your owner’s manual will be very helpful in this situation.

Replace the cover.",How to Replace an Automotive Fuse," The first and most important step before doing any electrical work on your car is to turn it off.;
, Now you can proceed looking for the fuse box. On most cars, it is either in the glove box or under it. You should not have to take anything apart in order to access it. There will, however, be a cover that you just pop open, but you won’t need any tools for that. A lot of cars have more than one fuse boxes. There is a chance that the one you are looking for is not in the car. In this case, it is most likely located in the engine compartment.

, After you have located the fuse box, find the cover and remove it. There must be a guide telling you what each fuse is for. It is usually printed on the cover itself.

, If you have ever seen a regular light bulb that has burned out, you will be to quickly identify the fuse you need to change. It looks very similar because the metal strip that is inside will be broken. Apart from that, the fuse might be slightly blackened.

, It should be easy to just pinch it with your fingers, but if it seems to be stuck or too difficult to grab with fingers, you can use a small screwdriver or ideally the “fuse remover” that many cars come with. This remover should be located in one of the slots.

, Take it to a specialized store and ask for a replacement, or just look at its specifications and get one online.

, Put the new one in the slot where the old one was and push. It should easily snap into place.

, Now that you have replace the fuse, it is time to start the car and see if whatever the fuse was responsible for is now working whether it’s your radio, interior lights or fan, for example.

, After you have made sure that everything works normally, simply put the fuse box cover back on.

Reinstall the starter if necessary.,
Connect the wiring.",How to Replace a Starter Solenoid," In order you to access the starter in some vehicles, you will need to jack it up. It’s important that you find a solid surface that can support the weight of the vehicle while it is supported on a jack and jack stands.Concrete and blacktop are the preferred surfaces for jacking up a vehicle.
Never jack a vehicle up on grass, dirt or gravel.;
, Before starting any project in your vehicle, you should disconnect the power source to prevent shocks and ensure you don’t damage the electrical system. Use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut on the negative terminal on the battery, then slide it off the terminal post.Tuck the cable to the side of the battery to ensure it can’t come into contact with the terminal.
You will not need to disconnect the positive cable.

, If you need to be beneath the vehicle to access the starter, slide a scissor or trolley jack under the vehicle at one of the designated jack points. Jack up the vehicle by lifting and pressing or turning the handle until it’s high enough for you to work under.If you are unsure where the designated jack points are for your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual.
Be careful not to jack the vehicle up in an area that can’t support the weight of the vehicle or you may do frame damage.

, Never work beneath a vehicle that is supported solely by a jack. Slide jack stands beneath the vehicle at designated jack points. Slowly lower the vehicle down onto the jack stands to ensure the vehicle is steady and the stands are in the proper position.Jack stands will not allow the vehicle to drop below the set height on the stand.
Hydraulic jacks may allow the vehicle to lower at an unpredictable rate without stands to support the vehicle.

, The starter solenoid is attached to the starter in most applications. The starter is a cylindrical component that is usually attached to the side of the transmission’s bell housing, where the transmission and engine meet.If you are unable to locate the starter, refer to the service manual for your vehicle for further guidance.
If your vehicle’s starter solenoid is not attached to the starter, use your vehicle’s service manual to locate it.

, The smaller cylinder attached to the starter is the starter solenoid. On most solenoids, there are three wires connected to terminals. Use pieces of masking tape to mark each wire with its corresponding terminal. One wire will be the top, or further from the starter, another will be the bottom, or closest, and the last one will be a wire pigtail that can only connect in one place.Marking the wires before you disconnect them will allow you to easily determine which wire connects where on the new solenoid.
If your solenoid has four wires going into it, be sure to mark the fourth accordingly.

, With the wires clearly marked, disconnect each of them from the solenoid. The pigtail can be disconnected by pressing on the release clip and pulling backward on the plastic harness. Do not pull on the wiring itself, or it may tear out of the plastic harness. The other two are often held in place by a bolt of screw.If you have to remove hardware to disconnect the wires, set them aside someplace safe.

, In some vehicles, you will not be able to access the solenoid’s fasteners without removing the starter itself. In these applications, use a wrench to remove the two bolts that secure the starter to the bell housing. Then slide the starter off of the engine.If you can access the solenoid easily without removing the starter, there is no need to remove it.
Be sure to keep the bolts you remove in a safe place for reuse when putting the starter back in.

, The starter solenoid is usually held in place by two screws. In some applications it may be bolts instead. Use the appropriate hand tool to remove the fasteners that secure the solenoid to the starter.You may need to spray the fasteners with a rust remover like WD40 in order to loosen them.
Be careful not to break the bolts as you remove them.

, With the fasteners removed, grip the solenoid tightly with one hand and slide it away from the starter and out. If the starter is still in the vehicle, this will be easier to do, but if you had to remove it, use your other hand to brace the starter as you pull the two components apart.The solenoid will pop out when you apply enough force.
Be sure the fasteners are removed before pulling on the solenoid, otherwise it will not release.

, While it’s always important to compare your new parts to the old ones to ensure they’ll fit, it is of particular importance with starter solenoid. The solenoid in your vehicle may have come with three terminals, whereas the replacement one likely will come with four. If your factory solenoid came with only three terminals, connect the third wire to the terminal marked with an “S” and do not utilize the other one.The terminal marked with the letter “I” is used only for vehicles that have four wires going to their starter solenoid.
If your vehicle came with three wires, a four terminal solenoid will work provided you connect the wires in the right way.

, Slide the new solenoid into the starter by sliding it into the housing you removed the old one from. You may need to apply a bit of pressure to pop the plunger into the starter housing.Be careful not to press the solenoid in at an angle.

, Take the screws or bolts you removed from the old solenoid and insert them into the new one. Tighten them by hand until the solenoid is secure and won’t vibrate loose. If the screws were damaged as you removed them, replace them with identical fasteners from your local hardware or auto parts store.

, If you had to remove the starter in order to gain access to the fasteners on the solenoid, put it back in the vehicle. Use the bolts you removed previously to secure the starter to the bell housing on the transmission.You may want to have your starter tested at a local auto parts store before reinstalling it to ensure there are no issues.
Be careful not to allow any debris to fall into the hole as you put the starter back into place.

, Use the labels you placed on the wires to guide you as you connect the wiring to the new solenoid. The top and bottom wires will go in exactly the same places as they did on the old solenoid. If your replacement solenoid has four terminals and you have three wires, attach the third wire to the terminal marked with an “S”.Once connected, reconnect the battery and attempt to start the vehicle.
Be sure the batter has a full charge or the starter will not initiate.

Check engine or service engine soon light on.,
Reset your car's ECM or PCM.,
Engine Control Unit, or ECU.,
The ECU's of today are very sophisticated computer chips that monitor all the data recorded by the various sensors in the engine.,
NOTE: This isn't the only way to reset the ECU.,
Make sure the car has already been warmed up to normal operating temperature and is turned off.,
Leave the fuses out for a few minutes to allow all the old data to be wiped out.,
Start up the car and let it idle for about 10 minutes.,
That's it, you're done.",How to Repair Your Vehicle (Basics)," Before you spend a lot of money, try this: Remove your gas cap and re-tighten it, a loose or bad seal on the gas cap can set an evap code in your cars ECM or ECU causing a check engine or service engine soon light to come on.;
, Loosen the negative terminal on your battery for 2 or 3 minutes, then reconnect your battery term. This will reset your car's ECM or PCM, if there is not a serious problem. If there seems to a problem then check the engine or service engine light and see if it will stay off. If the light comes back on, you have other problems, the next most common cause is a clogged or inop e.g.r valve.


You can also reset your ECM/ECU after installing performance parts for it to learn the new parts otherwise they will not perform 100 percent correctly.
Another way too reset is open the engine fuse box and remove the ecm/ecu fuse sometimes its the main fuse. After resetting start car/truck and let idle only do not touch anything during a 10 minute idle period.

, Actually with the introduction of OBD-II the name was officially changed to ECM (Engine Control Module). But everyone still knows it as the ECU so let's just keep calling it that so we all understand what we're talking about.

, Not only do they monitor the engine, they can also make changes based on the data that was recorded to keep the engine running at it's maximum possible efficiency. When a modification is done on one of our cars, the program that the ECU was running ends up conflicting with what is now going on in the engine. This can cause problems especially at idle when the engine hangs in the dangerously low RPMs or just stalls out. So instead of waiting for the ECU to adjust itself, you might need to reset it manually.

, There are many other ways but this is often the easiest way and, most importantly, the safest. Consult your manual for proper fuse locations. If you still have your stock radio, you will need the security code given to you by your dealer or (hopefully) by the person who sold you the car.

, Pop the hood and find the fuse box. It will be on the passenger side next to the battery as you can see in the first picture. Remove the lid and pull out both fuses as pictured in the second picture.

, Plug the fuses back in. It doesn't matter if you plug them in upside down or whatever they don't have any polarity so just make sure you plug the right fuse in the right place and you're all good. Make sure to replace the fuse box cover as well.

, Don't hit the gas pedal during this time. This time allows your ECU to make new data based on how much air it sees coming into. Use this time to reset your radio stations and clock. After 10 minutes is up, turn the car off.

, Once you start the car up again, the ECU should be aware of the changes to the motor. Have fun!

Be safe first.,
Be sure of the correct process and sequence of loosening and tightening of nuts and bolts which can be very important to keep from warping/ruining parts.,
Avoid using the wrong tool, loose or improper tool slipping off, or wrong size screwdriver can all ruin screws and nut/bolt heads before you get some of the hardest ones to access loose.,
Search for videos and discussions online about a problem that you are thinking about tackling or in the middle of doing.,
Get a ""Haynes"" manual (which is for less experienced users) from the parts store; even a pro uses a manual to perform repairs.,
Familiarize yourself briefly with the complete layout of the manual.,
Keep records of ""Scheduled Maintenance"" under your warranty which must be proven by receipts and records such as a log furnished by the dealer or the warranty provider.

,
Realize that the electrical section for fuses/fuse boxes (trickier than you might think) are often very poorly labeled, charts are poor, differ by year and by model, and are nearly illegible (hard to read).,
Start with small and simple: Repairing your vehicle assumes that you know what's wrong with it.,
Diagnose the problem.,
Gather tools and supplies needed for the job.,
Prepare the area.,
Follow the manual order and method instructions.,
Develop a system for placing parts that you had to remove to just get to the defective part in such a way that they will be easier to reassemble, replace properly, such as setting a bracket down correctly oriented, with it's accompanying hardware placed right by where it goes, rather than all jumbled in a pile.,
Take pictures.,
Draw a picture before dis-assembly -- or if you have to, get someone else to draw pictures and work on labeling them with you.

,
Use nail polish, or a number of clear scratches to mark the spot for alignment of parts.,
Realize that each repair is a relearning or learning process.,
Study each problem thoroughly before beginning: If you are in any doubt as to your ability to perform a needed repair, read the manual step-by-step R&R for that repair, re-read it; it will give you a pretty good idea whether you're up to it or not.

",How to Repair Your Own Car Without Experience," Be sure the engine is cool to touch. Many engine compartments are very crowded and it may be difficult to see the parts, screws and nuts, and accessing, reaching or even touching the parts, nuts and bolts is often tricky.
~ Causing an electrical short can ruin the cars computerized systems, relays and fuses.
~ Battery acid, hot fluids, and oil can each burn you, etc.
~ Mashed fingers, skinned knuckles, slips and misalignments are problematic.
~ Working under cars and in a street or parking lot are very dangerous.
~ Understand that ""lefty-loosey"" (means turn toward the left so that counter-clockwise is usually to loosen and remove bolts) and ""righty-tighty"" (right meaning clockwise is usually to tighten) though that direction of turning the tool is helpful.
~ You need to understand that when the nut/screw head is viewed from the opposite end that reverses that direction. Be sure of avoiding confusion about that direction when you are bending over looking down to reach a bolt that is away from your view, that is opposed to your usual view, or when you are looking up from underneath the car at a bolt/nut and needing to reach the head that is opposite from your view, etc. So think about it and go slow.;
,
~ Under tightening can cause leaks and failures (vibrating loose and falling off).
~ Over tightening of screws and bolts can strip, or break them off and be very difficult to extract the embedded broken off screw.

, You might have to use tricks to get them out (a punch or chisel, hacksaw, knife or drill may be needed occasionally, but can and do damage the screws and other parts). So ""get help"" for hard situations.

, Some videos and discussions are very good. You may find several on some topics or little or nothing on some others.

, Avoid the dealer service/repair manuals which are usually for experienced mechanics, are not easy to understand, are not detailed and call for use of special numbered tools (often unnecessary). While you may find a manual at the library, these manuals need to be exactly specific to your vehicle, which can make that difficult, and they are so indispensable, it is best to buy one.

, They are generally broken up into sections that each encompass a system on your vehicle, i.e. the section about ""Chassis Electrical"", ""Trouble-Shooting"" (by section, check it out), ""Suspension"" (shocks are not bad, but struts are tricky and complicated), etc., and ""Maintenance"" - general upkeep; see the main table of contents and indexes (at the beginning of each section, and an index at the back).

,,
~ Remove only ""one"" clear plastic fuse at a time and check by seeing if it is burned out ""one by one"" to keep from mixing them up. Replace or put it back before you look at the next one.
~ There are usually some special, large fuses and relays in a fuse box in the engine compartment or scattered here and there and inline fuse links (in wiring), but the usual fuse boxes for owner/operator access are below the instrument panel or on the ""kickpanel"" near the driver. Some pickups, vans, and trucks have fuse boxes in odd locations compared to where they are located in cars. You might find a fuse panel in the glove box or by unscrewing a cover in the dashboard/near the instrument panel.

, This is often the most difficult part of a vehicle repair, as the repair itself is covered step-by-step in the manual. Diagnosing can be quite tricky, and must be done correctly to avoid ""throwing parts at it"", or making an incorrect (and probably expensive) repair. While there are ""logic trees/troubleshooting charts"" in the manual to test some specific parts, what about when you don't know which part is bad?


Caution: to replace a set of sparkplug-cables or the spark plugs ""only remove one"" and replace that one, and then the next one -- to avoid getting the cables out of sequence which is very likely and would cause firing out of order which could damage the engine.

, This is where the parts store guy becomes your friend. These guys are often hired for their knowledge; a correct diagnosis by them equals a parts sale. They have a diagnostic code reader that they may attach and read for you (hoping to sell parts) or one that you can borrow for free (with a deposit) -- that's right, the same service you have been paying $60-$90 for at your repair shop can be done by the parts people or you for nothing.
~ They can also run diagnostics on your de-installed parts such as starter, battery, alternator, etc. If you don't click with the first parts guy you talk to, shop around, as you are going to find one you do like to work with, and probably follow him around as he changes parts store jobs in your town.

, Nothing is more of a pain than to be buried in the engine compartment up to your elbows when you realize you don't have a new (insert cheap but vital tool here). Some back and forth to the store is inevitable, even when you have become comfortable doing this; it helps to remember that you are going to get something that you will own when you are finished with this specific repair, in the case of needing, say, a small specialty tool, and various metric versus customary (English fraction of inch measures) tools.
~ ""Rent to own"" larger more expensive specialty tools at auto parts stores (But, actually you buy it and get a refund ""only if"" you bring it back with the receipt, and the tool is in ""new condition"", within 48 hours for example).

, Block wheels to prevent rolling. If you are going to be leaking fluids, put down a drop cloth. If you will need to get under the car, a flattened, large cardboard box or a scrap of carpet pad can make all the difference for comfort when you are lying on the ground and for cleanliness.
~ Caution: Always use ""jack stands"" to help maintain the security and safety of the jack when you must raise the vehicle.
~ Drive up ramps are quite useful, but some very low cars can ""not"" work with the ramps.
~ Driving two wheels onto a curb may work in a pinch to help raise one side or an end of a vehicle.

, It can be tempting to get in a hurry, and think that some steps seem irrelevant -- until later.

, A good method will also incorporate reversing the order of removal to put it together again.
~ Caution: A manual instruction such as ""now replace the peripheral flange bracket"" is useless to you, if you can't remember how the bracket came off -- and while the manual is helpful, the pictures often are not very clear and are not labeled or explained well.

, Label parts with tape and names and numbering, etc. Cell phone pictures are small, and it's more helpful if you are able to upload them to your PC when needed; but even a small picture, taken from very close to show a vital detail, can potentially save you hours.

,, If, as you are removing a part, you find yourself asking, ""I wonder how I'll remember if that goes this way, there, or there?"", a dot of nail polish, after a quick wipe off, can tell you. Nail polish applied to two touching/matching parts for gaskets, etc. can save you of the need to re-calibrate, re-time, and re-adjust after the repair is completed -- you just re-align the polish stroke or scratches.

, The first time you ""R""emove & ""R""eplace an alternator, it might be frustrating.
~ Take breaks if needed. When you are finished, realize that your next alternator ""R&R"" on this or a similar model will happen in about 1/3 the time -- and any alternator R&R, even on a truck, is now within your reach.

",How to Change the HID Headlights on a 2007 Prius (Without Removing Bumper)," With experience, the process will take less than 5 minutes, but allow extra time if this is your first time changing the bulbs. You don't need help from anybody. This is a very light job. You may wish to change both HID light bulbs at the same time simply because if one of them failed the other may fail soon.;
, 2006-2009 Priuses use D4R HID bulbs. The stock bulbs are made by Phillips and have a color temperature of 3400K. These can be found on eBay for $35 per bulb rather than the $150 charged by Toyota. Other brands can be found for $50 per pair.
Other color temperatures are also available. The higher the color temperature, the more blue the lights will be (example: 8000K is much bluer than the stock 4300K (bright yellowish)).
While it may be a good idea to replace both bulbs at the same time, if you choose not to do this, make sure to get the same color temperature bulb as the existing one or your headlights will appear different. In some places, it may be illegal to use higher kelvin (more blue or purple) bulbs. Some users note that the standard 4300K bulbs provide the best visible light for nighttime driving, and do not recommend going above 5000K.

,


Phillips head screwdriver
Flathead screwdriver
Small flashlight
Telescopic mirror (helps to take a peek before and after removing parts that you can't see well)
Rubber or latex gloves (for grip and to avoid getting oil on the new bulbs)

,, (You do not need to remove all the fasteners or the entire cover). This fastener is not a regular screw. Turn it with a phillips screwdriver without pushing down, and the center will pop up. You can then use a flathead screwdriver to gently pry the clip out of its hole.

, This is a black plastic piece that looks like a snorkel, and is blocking your access to the rear of the passenger side headlight assembly. Once you have removed the fastener in the previous step, you can gently lift the plastic radiator cover to reveal the plastic fastener holding the vent tube. The fastener has two indentations that will receive a flathead screwdriver. Gently pry the fastener out, and remove the vent tube. As you remove the tube, it is a good idea to note how it seats on the opening below so you'll know how to replace it.

, It has a pop-out screw or clip on the left and one threaded screw towards the firewall on top with a bolt/washer combo that holds it down. Also, there is an electrical wire that pops free from the right side. Take off the two electrical connectors at the bottom of the front of the reservoir by squeezing them and pulling. Now the container will come out with a little manipulation. The front plastic tab that goes to that threaded screw hold down will need to be bent just a tad to release from under the front lip and the whole thing will come out. You can probably let the container rest right there lifted up and out of the way; if you have very large hands, you can remove the “slide off” rubber hose connectors ""on bottom"" that will allow you to completely remove it and sit it on the ground.

,, These are the two that are closest to the headlight assembly, and will create a bit more room for your hand to reach behind the headlight assembly. These relays have several pins and pull straight out of the fusebox. Apply steady pressure and a slight wiggle and they will pull out.

, This is the round plastic part that is about 4 inches (10.2 cm) across and has little fins around the outside. You need to turn it about an eighth of a turn counterclockwise. It has a very sticky O-ring to keep out moisture and may be very reluctant to turn. If this is the first time this part has been removed, then this step is by far the most time consuming of the entire process. The little fins to give you traction when attempting to turn... don't hit them with a screwdriver nor should you use pliers or tools, as you ""will"" break them off if you do!!! Using some garden gloves to improve grip and grab and turn counterclockwise. If it resists wiggle it a bit to loosen the large O ring underneath and try again. ""Constant"" tension seems to be the key... if you look very close you will see it turning very slowly. It takes about an eighth of a turn before it stops and you can wiggle it free. Once you've done this once, it’s much easier should you need to do it again.

, You can gently move the cover out of the way without disconnecting the connector... just be careful not to pull on the wires.

, Turn the chrome connector at the top (with a wire mesh connection) about an eighth of a turn counterclockwise and you will hear a click. Then pull it off. It may be a good idea ""not"" to touch the inside of this connector as it comes from the ballast with high voltage. (One user reported putting it near metal to discharge it and on one occasion actually hearing a pop from the arc).

, Gloves are not required but may be useful. Just handle the bulb at the socket end.

, Use a mirror and flashlight to see how the wire retaining spring latches ""before"" you remove it. They pull in, and back ""towards the front of the car"" and then out away from the base to release to let it fall forward ""towards the engine"" to release the bulb.

, Two things to note: The HID bulb fits only in the right orientation -- see grooves in its base. The solid wire on the bottom of the bulb goes to the bottom when positioned properly in the lens. If you look at the outside of the headlight, you will be able to see the bulb as you remove it, and note its orientation. Replace it the same way, or you will have a nasty shadow on the ground as it shines.

, Be careful not to touch the glass. It helps to watch from the outside of the car through the front of the headlight lens while you insert the bulb to insure correct orientation and seating.

, If you have it fastened correctly, the bulb will be firmly seated and will not move when gently wiggled. Use a mirror again to verify that both tabs are seated properly.

, Remember that the connector will need to be turned 1/8th of a turn clockwise to fasten it, so give it a slight turn in the opposite direction before connecting it to the bulb so you can then turn it to lock it in place. It goes on very gracefully and easily.

,, The rubber seal prevents moisture from destroying the HID bulb inside. Turn the black cover 1/8th of a turn clockwise, making sure it fits well.

, Turn on the car and test the lights, and verify that it lights properly on low and high beams, and that the light is in alignment with the headlight on the other side. If the bulb seems out of alignment, the bulb may be seated improperly. Remove the back of the assembly again and re-insert the bulb to make sure it is seated correctly. Both headlights should be aimed at the same level.

,, Make sure to seat it properly, and then insert the plastic fastener into the hole on top.

, Replace the single fastener that we removed to access the vent tube.

, If you optionally removed the relays, replace them. View the pins to align them properly into the fuse box and gently press them into place until they seat.

My '07 Jetta's low-beam headlight was an H7 series bulb, which costs about $8.00 (generic). Once you have purchased the bulb, go back out to your car and...;
, The headlight assembly will be located directly behind the headlight.

, It is a round, black cover that looks and behaves like the lid of a jar. As it clearly states on its face, turn it about an inch and it will pop right off. Don't let it fall down into the engine area.

, That's right, the entire socket just twists right out. The socket is made of plastic and has a nice wavy, blue handle on it that allows you to twist it. The chamber that houses the socket is made of white plastic, has wires connected to it, and serves as the walls that the socket twists into (see pic). There are some white plastic pegs pointing inward towards the socket. You must turn the socket counter-clockwise so the holes in it align with the pegs and the socket slides out. Be careful, as the old bulb is still plugged in to the socket, and you will be pulling both out together.

, You will see that the bulb simply plugs in to the socket like any household appliance plug. Remove it by its metal, disc-like base.

, It is VERY IMPORTANT that you do *NOT* touch the glass of the new bulb. The impurities and heat from your fingers could irreparably damage and kill your bulb. The guy at Autozone sold me some goop to put on the bulb plug and in the socket connectors to keep it from crusting over with corrosion, but it's not really necessary.

, After plugging the bulb into the socket, slide it back into the chamber so the white pegs pass back through the holes. Twist the socket counter-clockwise to lock it in its chamber, making sure that the portion of the socket marked ""TOP"" is at the top and the socket is firmly in place (you wouldn't want it falling out while you're driving).

, Screw the cover back on and close the hood firmly.

, Make sure the bulb is in properly (check the picture).

, Press in on the wire and lock it back in place.

,,, Troubleshooting:


Check the headlight fuse first.
If the new bulb doesn't work, check the old one to make sure it's burned out. Sometimes burned out bulbs are obvious but some only show a minor discoloration of the filament. If you suspect the old one did not burn out, wiggle the electrical connection.
If the new bulb won't work and the old one looks fine there is an electrical problem.
If you suspect an electrical problem and you've got a multimeter and a lot of patience, you can find the cause. If you have neither, go see a mechanic.

, Here you will find another three screws underneath the steering on the lower dash the screws are clearly visible and they are also Philips screws. Unscrew all these screws. Now you will be able to remove the panel around the steering column – just pull on it and it will come off. Once you have removed the lower panel around the steering column, you will see another screw that was hidden by the panel it's also a Philips screw, it is located to the right of the steering column locate that screw and unscrew it.

, Just grab the side where the two Philips screws were and wiggle it loose from the left side and to wiggle it loose from the right side before you can pull it completely off, there is a wire leading to the back of the cigarette lighter plug there will be a clip attached to the back of that gives power to the lighter plug, simply disconnect the clip. Know you can completely remove the center console.

, The head unit is held by only two screws which are at the back of the radio. The only way to access these screws is to go through where the center console was and there you can access the two screws at the rear of the head unit, which are also Philips screws. Unscrew these screws. Now you will be to pull out the deck or you can push it out by reaching behind.

, They are connected to a clip just unclip the clip from the head unit by pressing on both sides of it, also you need to pull out the antenna plug which is a separate black wire attached to the head unit just simply pull on that wire.

, First install the mounting kit, which is really simple – just insert the mounting kit where the old head unit was and it should fit in place.

, Here you will need your aftermarket wiring harness. Simply connect the aftermarket wiring harness to the clip that was attached to the radio. Your aftermarket deck should of come with the wires attached to it. Take these wires and strip off the insulation from all the wires; also strip all the wires on the wiring harness.

, All aftermarket wiring harnesses and head unit have the same colour wires and all the wires are meant to do the same thing. This makes are job much easier, because know all you have to do is attach the each wire to it's matching colour. To attach the wires together you take the two wires and twist the bare wire that which you have exposed when you stripped the wires. Once you have twisted the two pieces of wire together wrap the exposed wire with electrical tape. Do this will all the colours.

,, Make sure all the speakers are working. If a speaker does not work or the head unit does not turn on you probably mixed up wires somewhere.

, Doing this is just the reverse of what you did before. Note that you will have two screws that you need to use, which are the screws at the rear of the stock head unit.

Level your car.,
Position your car.,
Turn the headlights on.,
Make sure the lights are level.,
Back your car exactly 25 feet (7.6 m) from the wall or garage door.,
Adjust each headlight separately.,
Turn the upper screw or bolt to adjust the vertical field.,
Turn the side screws or bolts to adjust the horizontal field.,
Test your alignment on the road.",How to Adjust Car Headlights," Start by removing any excess weight from the trunk of the car. Also, ensure that the tire pressure in all tires is at the manufacturer's recommended levels. If possible, have somebody sit in the driver's seat, and that the gas tank is half-full. As well as this, check that your headlight aim adjustment wheel (if fitted) is at the zero position.;
, On level ground, park 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) from a dark wall or garage door, with the front of the car aimed at the wall. A paved parking lot or level driveway is best.









Bounce the car a couple times on all four corners to make sure the shocks are leveled.
Measure the distance to the ground from both headlights to ensure that the suspension itself is level., Do not use your high beams or fog lights. Mark the horizontal and vertical center lines of the headlight beams with masking tape to make two T’s on the wall or garage door.








, Place a carpenter’s level between the two marked center lines to see if they are even. If they are not even, use a tape measure to measure how far up the wall the lower mark is and lower the other center line marker to the same height. These center lines should be no higher than 3.5 feet (1.1 m) from the ground.








, Don't estimate the distance! Use a tape measure to make sure you are the proper distance away from the wall. Turn off the headlights. Remove the trim ring from around the headlights and locate the adjusting screws. These screws are typically found adjacent to the headlight, though some manufacturers put the screws in the engine compartment, behind the the headlights. The horizontal adjuster and the vertical adjuster should be marked.









Always defer to the specs in the owner's manual—some manufacturers recommend different distances for proper adjustment. For example, Toyota recommends 10 feet (3.0 m) feet, Pontiac GTO recommends 15 feet (4.6 m), and Chrysler recommends 3 feet (0.9 m) for some models. For this reason, it's important to check your owner's manual and follow those guidelines.There should be one screw at the top of the headlight to adjust vertically and another screw to one side of the headlight to adjust horizontally, though some cars may feature adjustment bolts rather than screws.

, Block one with a sweatshirt or other object while adjusting and testing the other, since the light-bleed can make it difficult to distinguish one from the other. Have a helper sit in the driver's seat while you do the adjustments, to turn the lights on and off while you make the proper adjustments.








, Clockwise turns should raise the lights, while counterclockwise turns should lower the lights.


Turn the headlights on after adjusting and look at the light pattern on the wall. The top of the most intense part of the beam should be even with, or just below the center of the line of tape you made.

, Now, you'll do basically the same thing with the right-left adjustment. The majority of the intense part of the beam should be to the right of the vertical line (or to the left of it if you drive on the left side of the road)








, Take your car out for a test drive to make sure the headlights are adjusted properly. Readjust if necessary by repeating the above steps.

Replace the main power fuse.",How to Install a Capacitor," The capacitor acts as a storage tank for electrical power. The amount of power that the capacitor can store is measured in Farads and the general rule of thumb is that you will need one Farad of capacitance for every one kilowatt (or 1,000 Watts) of power demand in your system., Some capacitors come with built in meters that display their current charge. Keep in mind that if you go this route you will need to wire the meter into a switched power supply so that it the meter turns off with the car. Otherwise, the meter would stay on constantly and drain your system., Odds are, if you need a capacitor, you have dropped some money on electrical components in your car. The cost of your capacitor could range from around $30.00 to over $200.00 depending on how large and how fancy you decide to go. Remember that they all serve essentially the same function, and that for most people a one Farad capacitor without an internal meter will work just fine.

, A charged capacitor can release a large amount of energy very quickly. This can be quite dangerous. You should always handle electrical components with care. , This will kill power electrical system and allow you to work safely.


If you already have a capacitor in your system you will need to discharge it. Capacitors store power, and thus can still shock you even after removing the power supply.

, There is only a negligible difference in effectiveness no matter where you place it, but nearest the components that are struggling to get power (such as dimming headlights) is considered best. It is important that wherever you place it has a suitable place to mount the capacitor away from passengers.Although you are installing the capacitor to keep up with the extra power that is being pulled from accessories such as an upgraded stereo system, you have to remember that the capacitor is like a storage tank for power that supplements the whole system. By putting it close to the parts that are not getting sufficient power you allow it to supply power to those parts with minimal loss do to the extra resistance of a long wire.

, Whether you are connecting to the battery, amp, or a distribution block of some kind, you need to connect the positive terminal of the capacitor to the positive terminal of the other component by running a wire between them. Eight gauge wire is usually recommended., This terminal needs to be connected to ground., If your capacitor has an internal meter, it will also have a third wire. This is the remote turn on wire and serves to kill power to the meter whenever the car is turned off. You will need to wire this into the remote turn on wire into any 12 volt switched power source (such as the ignition switch or amplifier)., This will restore power to your system. All of your components should now be working.

, This fuse is installed with your system to prevent damage to the electrical components of your car, but will need to be removed before charging the capacitor. It should be near the battery on the main power line for your audio system., This this will provide you a place to install the resistor that will help you charge your capacitor.The resistor allows the capacitor to charge more slowly. This prevents damage to the capacitor and the electrical system.

, It is usually recommended to use a resistor that is 1 Watt and 500-1,000 Ohms. A higher impedance (Ohm value) will charge the capacitor more slowly and prevent damage. Connect the positive terminal of the capacitor to the resistor., A multi-meter will do the job fine as well. Set it to read DC Volts and put the positive lead of the meter on the positive terminal of the capacitor and the negative lead of the meter to ground. When the meter reads 11-12 volts, the capacitor is charged.Another way to charge a capacitor is to wire a test light from the positive terminal of the capacitor to the power line. As long as the capacitor is charging, there will be current flowing through the light and the light will shine. Once the capacitor is charged the light will go out because current will no longer be flowing (the voltage drop between the power line and the capacitor will be zero)., It is no longer necessary to monitor the status of the capacitor. If you used the light method, you can now remove the test light.

, Disconnect the positive terminal of the capacitor from the resistor and disconnect the resistor from the power wire. It is no longer needed, so you can store it away in case you ever need to charge your capacitor again.

, This will allow your audio system to receive power once again.

Listen to the vehicle as you attempt to start it.,
Ensure the battery terminals are clean and secure.,
Charge your vehicle’s battery.,
Check to see the starter solenoid is bad.",How to Install a Car Starter," Use an appropriate sized hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut that secures the cable on the negative terminal on the battery. You don’t need to remove the nut completely; once its loose simply slide the cable up and off the terminal. Tuck the cable to the side of the battery to ensure it won’t touch the terminal as you work.You will not need to remove the positive cable on the battery.
Always disconnect the battery before servicing the electrical system in your vehicle.;
, In some applications, you may need to jack up the vehicle in order to access the starter. In such instances, place a jack beneath one of the designated jack points for the front of the vehicle and raise and lower or turn the handle in order to lift it off of the ground.Ensure you jack the vehicle up on firm, level ground.
Place jack stands beneath the vehicle once it’s at the appropriate height.

, The starter will have a wire running to it from the battery or fuse box, and looks like a large cylinder with a smaller one attached to it. If you are unable to locate the starter in your vehicle, refer to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle for guidance.The smaller cylinder attached to the starter is the starter solenoid.
A wire should run directly from the positive terminal on the battery or from the fuse box under the hood to the top terminal on the starter solenoid.

, Depending on the application, there could be a few different types of connections transferring power from the electrical system of the vehicle to the starter. Use the appropriate hand tools to disconnect any connections going to the starter.In some cases, it may just be clips you need to disconnect for the wiring.
On some starters, you will need to loosen bolts or screws that hold the wires in place.

, Most starters have two retaining bolts that hold the starter in place against the side of the motor where it meets the transmission. Use a socket of the appropriate size to remove the bolts in order remove the starter.Be sure to use the correct size socket, otherwise you risk damaging the bolts.
You may need to pull on the starter with a bit of force in order to remove it from the engine once the bolts have been removed.

, Place the old starter side by side with the new one on a table and compare them for similarities and differences. The two should look nearly identical and the holes for the starter retainer bolts should be in the exact same place. The starter solenoid may have four terminals instead of two, but that won’t be an issue.If the two starters don’t look mostly identical, it may not be the correct starter for your vehicle.
New starter solenoids often come with four terminals, but can be used with only two.

, Insert the starter into the same mounting location you removed the old one from. Depending on the vehicle, you may need to do so from above or below the engine.Ask a friend to hold the starter in place if you can.
You may need to snake the starter down and around other components of the engine to place it properly.

, With the starter in place, slide the two retainer bolts through the bracket on the engine and the starter. Thread them in by turning them clockwise by hand until you’re sure they are threading properly, then use the appropriate socket and wrench to tighten them the rest of the way.If the bolt does not thread properly, unscrew it and try again.
Make sure the bolts are tight so they can’t vibrate loose while the engine is running.

, With the starter secured in place, reconnect the wiring you disconnected from the old starter onto the terminals on the new one. If your new solenoid has four terminals but your old one had two, only utilize the top and bottom terminal on the new solenoid. If your old one had four and the new one does as well, connect them to the same terminals they were connected to on the old one.Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle if you are unsure as to which wire connects to which terminal.

, With the starter installed and wired, reconnect the black cable to the negative terminal on the battery and tighten it in place. Insert the key into the ignition and attempt to start the vehicle.If the vehicle fails to start with the new starter in place, ensure the battery is fully charged.
Check to ensure all of the wires are securely connected at either end, then start the vehicle again.

, As you turn the key in the ignition, listen for the sounds the engine makes to help determine if you have an issue with your starter. If the engine makes no sound whatsoever, or you hear only a faint clicking, it may be because there isn’t enough power reaching the electric starter motor.If the engine attempts to turnover but fails, it could be another issue.
If the engine does nothing, the battery may just be dead.

, Check the battery terminals to ensure there is a strong connection between the terminals and the cables. The cables should be securely held in place and should not be able to wiggle or be removed from the terminal without loosening the nut on each cable. Clean corroded battery terminals with a steel toothed brush to ensure a strong connection.A weak connection from the battery can prevent the engine from starting.
Wear gloves when cleaning battery terminals to avoid getting battery acid on your skin.

, If you suspect the battery may simply be low on power, try charging it using either a trickle charger or another vehicle to jump start it. Be sure to connect the red cable to the positive terminal on each vehicle and the black to the negative.Leave the other vehicle running when jump starting the vehicle and allow it to charge the battery in yours.
If using a trickle charger, be sure to leave the battery charging in a safe area that won’t be rained on.

, The starter solenoid transfers power from the battery to the electric motor that starts the engine. If it fails to transmit the electricity, the starter motor will fail to function. Test the starter solenoid by touching a test light to the lower terminal on the starter, then ground the negative cable to the body of the car. Have a friend turn the ignition key and see if it lights up.If the test light does not light up, it means power is not reaching the starter motor due to a faulty solenoid or a dead battery.
If the test light does light up, it means the solenoid is good, but the starter itself may have failed.

This should answer important questions such as what the voltage requirements are for charging your battery and whether or not you should remove it from the vehicle before charging.Almost all car batteries are 12 volt, but the charging voltage can vary depending on the amount of charge your battery currently has and the temperature., There will be a manual with your battery charger that provides details for the appropriate use of the charger., Working in a well-ventilated area will help dissipate the hydrogen gas that batteries generate from the sulfuric acid within their cells. Also, make sure to keep any other volatile substances, such as gasoline, flammable materials, or ignition sources (flames, cigarettes, matches, lighters) away from the battery at all times.

, Glasses, gloves, and other protective gear is a good precaution. Hydrogen released within the battery quickly converts to a gas and expands, this can cause the battery to explode if venting mechanisms fail.Once the hydrogen is in contact with the oxygen in the air, it is highly flammable and can be ignited even by static electricity., These accessories draw power from the battery and should be turned off before removing or charging the battery.

, Most batteries will be found either under the hood of the vehicle or in the trunk. It is also possible that your battery may be under the rear seat, and sometimes the battery can only be accessed from underneath the side of the car., One post will be grounded by being connected to the vehicle’s chassis. The other post will be “hot,” meaning that current will flow from it to the grounded post in a circuit. There are a few ways to tell which is which:


Look for labels such as “POS,” “P,” or “+” for the positive post and “NEG,” “N,” or “-“ for the negative (grounded) posts on the battery case.
Compare the diameters of the battery posts. For most batteries, the positive post is thicker than the negative post.
If the battery cables are connected to the posts, note the color of the cables. The cable connected to the positive post should be red, while the cable connected to the negative post should be black., Disconnect the grounded terminal (negative), then the ungrounded terminal (positive) before removing the battery.

, Some vehicles require that you remove the battery before charging, others do not. Follow the instructions provided in your owner’s manual or with your battery.


Typically if the battery you’re charging is for a boat, you must take the battery out of the boat and charge it on shore. You can charge the battery inside the boat only if you have a charger and other equipment that is specifically meant for doing so.Using a battery carrier to move the battery from the vehicle to the place where you will connect it to the charger is recommended. This will avoid putting pressure on the battery ends and forcing battery acid out of the vent caps, as might happen if you carry it in your hands.

, Use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean any corrosion off the terminals and neutralize any sulfuric acid that may have spilled on them. You can apply the mixture with an old toothbrush. Alternatively, you can clean off mild corrosion by using a wire brush. Auto parts stores even sell a special round wire brush that fits over the terminals.


Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth right after cleaning the terminals. Wash your hands immediately. Do not touch any white gunk that may appear on the terminals, as this is congealed sulfuric acid.

, Pouring water into your battery cells disperses hydrogen gas from the cell. Do not use tap water as it will damage your battery over time.Replace the cell caps after filling. Most U.S. batteries, they are equipped with flame arrestors. If your battery does not have flame-arresting caps, put a wet cloth across the top of the caps.
If you have a battery that does not need filled with water (known as maintenance free batteries) or if your battery caps are sealed then you should ignore this step and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for charging your battery.

, This will reduce the possibility of damage to the unit from any airborne sulfuric acid vapor.


Never place the charger directly above or below the battery., This is done by adjusting the voltage output selector, usually on the front of the charging unit. If the required voltage isn’t posted on the battery case itself, it should be in the vehicle owner’s manual.


If your charger has an adjustable rate of charge you should start at the lowest rate.

, This step is the same whether the battery is removed from the vehicle for charging or not.

, There are two different cases for connecting the ground.

If the battery has not been removed from the vehicle, connect the battery charger’s grounding cable to a heavy-gauge metal part of the engine block or chassis. This prevents arcing at the battery terminal and will not run the risk of causing the battery to explode. Clipping the grounding cable directly to the negative battery terminal can be dangerous.
If the battery has been removed from the vehicle, you should connect a jumper cable or insulated battery cable at least 24 inches (60 cm) long to the grounded post. Then, connect the battery charger clip for the grounded post to this cable. This allows you to be away from the battery when you complete the circuit in case it explodes. It is also a good idea not to be facing the battery when you connect the charger to the jumper cable.

, The charger should be equipped with a grounded plug (three pronged plug) and should be plugged into a properly grounded outlet (three prong outlet). An adapter should not be used.

Use an extension cord only if absolutely necessary. If an extension cord is necessary, it should be a grounded (three pronged) extension cord and be the proper wire size to accommodate the amperage of the charger. An adapter should not be used between the charger and extension cord or the extension cord and the wall.

, You can tell this by using the recommended charging time for your battery or looking to see if the charge indicator shows the battery has been fully charged.

, Once your battery is fully charged, you will need to systematically unhook your components. Start by unplugging the charger from the outlet., Disconnect from the grounded terminal first. Again, this will be the negative terminal on the battery if the battery was removed and will be the clip attached to a metal component of the vehicle if the battery was not removed.

, This will be the clip on the positive battery post.

Some battery chargers have an engine starting feature. If your battery charger has one, you can leave it connected to the battery when you start the vehicle’s engine; if not, you must disconnect the charger before you start the engine. In either case, avoid moving engine parts if you start the engine with the hood raised or cover removed.

, This will only be necessary if you had to remove your battery for charging.

, Connect to the ungrounded (positive) terminal first, then to the grounded (negative) terminal.

Ground the last clamp.,
Start the donor vehicle and let it idle for a few minutes before you attempt to start the car with the dead battery.,
Disconnect the jumper cables in the following order once you get the dead-battery car running:


Negative ground (engine-block bolt or, less desirably, negative terminal on the dead battery).",How to Hook up Jumper Cables," Position the vehicles so that the batteries are as close together as possible, but make sure the two cars do not touch.;
,, Set the parking brakes, and switch each car into park or neutral (for automatic or manual transmissions, respectively).

, The cables leading to the positive battery terminal are almost always red. If you're in doubt, the battery itself has a ""+"" and ""-"" sign to mark the positive and negative terminals.


Check the terminals on the battery for corrosion before jump starting. If you notice any corrosion on the terminals, clean them and then try to start the car once more before proceeding with the jump. The battery may not be dead it just may have a bad connection.

,


Leads on jumper cables are normally not the exact same length to prevent them from touching. If they are the same length, make sure they have not been modified in any way or damaged.

, Make sure the clamp is securely attached to the battery terminal.


On some vehicles, you may have to remove a plastic cover from the positive battery terminal before you can make this connection.

, Again, make sure the clamp is securely connected and won't slip off due to vibration in the engine compartment.

,, Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface inside the engine compartment on the vehicle with the dead battery — the farther from the battery, the better.


An unpainted bolt on the engine block is ideal. Remember, the clamp must be able to ""bite"" securely onto the object in question and hold in place, even if the engine vibrates.
You can, theoretically, connect the second black clamp to the negative terminal on the dead battery instead. But this produces a spark, which could ignite hydrogen fumes from the battery.
Check to make sure no part of the jumper cables — or tools, or battery covers — dangle into the engine compartment, where it might foul belts, pulleys, or other moving parts.

, Run the RPM up to about 3,000 as you attempt to start the car with the dead battery.

Remove the negative side battery cable from the negative battery terminal.,
Connect the black wire to the com input on a multimeter and the red wire to the 10A or 20A input on the multimeter.,
Attach a multimeter (set the dial on the multimeter to measure Amps as per multimeters instructions) between the negative cable and the negative battery post.,
If the ammeter is reading over 25–50 milliamps, something is using too much battery power.

,
Go to the fuse panel(s) and remove fuses, one at a time.,
Watch for the ammeter to drop to acceptable drain.,
Check each device (circuit) on that fuse.,
Repeat steps 1 & 2 to test your repair.,
Try unhooking the big wire from your alternator.",How to Find a Parasitic Battery Drain,";
, The meter needs to be able to read at least 2 or 3 amps for this test to work. Connecting the red wire to the mA input on the multimeter won't work and could damage the meter.

, Wait a few seconds to several minutes for the car to go into sleep mode — i.e. when you make the contact with the ammeter, the car's computer systems ""wake up."" After a bit of time they will go back to ""sleep.""

,, Pull the main fuses (higher amp ratings) last. Perform the same steps on all relays found in the fuse panel. Sometimes relay contacts can fail to release, causing a drain. Be sure to observe the ammeter after pulling each fuse or relay.

, The fuse that reduces the drain is the draw. Consult the owners' manual or service manual to find what circuits are on that fuse.

, Disconnect each lamp, heater, electrical device one at a time to find the drain.

, The ammeter will tell you exact numbers.

, The alternator can sometimes have a shorted diode that can cause amps to flow through the alternator's power cable and through the shorted diode and into the case and through the bolts and back to the negative battery terminal. This will drain a battery in a hurry.Make sure to read the ammeter before and after unplugging your Alternator.

Take the necessary precautions before you try to disconnect your battery.,
Find the negative terminal on the top of your car's battery.,
Determine what size socket you need to loosen the nut on the negative terminal.,
Follow the same procedure to disconnect the positive terminal.,
Continue with your work.",How to Disconnect a Car Battery," Besides holding a potentially lethal electrical charge, batteries contain corrosive agents that can produce a flammable gas. Before you remove your car's battery, take these safety steps.









Turn off the ignition.
Wear safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and hands.;
, It usually has a black cover. The battery itself may have a minus sign near the connector post. The positive terminal usually has a red cap or a plus sign on the battery near its connection post.

, Always work on the negative terminal before the positive when you disconnect your battery.









Grab a socket from your socket kit and hold it near, but not against, the nut on the negative terminal of your battery. Ascertain visually the socket size you'll need to loosen the nut.
Put the appropriately sized socket on your wrench. You might have to attach a wrench extender to reach the nut.
Put the wrench on the nut on the negative terminal and turn counterclockwise (remember: righty tighty, lefty loosey). It will take only a few turns to loosen it.
Pull the negative connector from the battery after you've loosened the nut. Push it aside so it is unable to make contact with the battery while you're doing your work.
If the cable is seized to the battery post, a special battery cable removal tool may be needed to remove the negative connector. Ask your local auto parts store or mechanic.

, After removing it from the terminal, don't let the positive connector touch any metal part of the car. There is residual current in the system that, if it were to touch a metal surface, could disrupt or damage the circuits in the vehicle.








, With the battery cables disconnected, you can safely perform repairs on electrical components of the vehicle. If you just need to put in a new car battery, it can be done in a few simple steps.









After the battery is disconnected, unscrew the brackets that hold it in its tray.
Lift the battery straight up, out of its tray. Keep in mind that car batteries can weigh 40 lbs. so ask for help if you need it.
Using an old toothbrush, brush the tray and battery cables with a diluted baking-soda mixture and allow them to dry before putting in your new car battery.
Place the new battery on the tray and tighten the clamps.
Connect the cable for the positive terminal first, then the negative. Remember to securely tighten the nuts on each.
Close the hood and start the car.
Dispose of the old battery properly. The auto-parts store you bought your new battery from probably will take the old one as part of its service arrangement. If not, take it to a recycling center or automotive garage. Most accept old batteries for a nominal fee.

Know your model.,
Try going on the car manufacturer's website or go on guilds or other sites on the internet.,

Tell the dealership about your thermostat, your oven range, sink, and other fixtures in the house.,
When you are fully satisfied, sign the contract, and the dealership will file out the paperwork.,
Keep your eyes open during installation.",How to Have an Electric Car Charger Installed at Home," All electric cars have a different style, and so do their electric car chargers. Not all car chargers are the same. Each car from different manufactures will assign a specific car charger to you.

There are electric cars like the Nissan Leaf, Toyota RAV4 Electric, and BMW i8 which are electric powered. However, they use different power inputs and use different car chargers with different designs. If you need further assistance, go contact your car dealership. Even if you probably know it, you want to double check anyways. Better safe than sorry.;
,

Your car manufacturer's website usually shows the specifications for your vehicle, and are genuine. Other sites may have false information, so sticking with the website you know and trust is a better choice.
If your car manufacturer's website does not show the specifications for your vehicle, go to your dealership for your vehicle specifications, as they can give true information about your car. It's better to go drive to your dealership than to go on your computer and use wrong information.

, The garage is the place where your electric car will charge. However, electric car chargers only work in certain garages, so check your garage to see if you are fit for installing an electric car charger.

If you have an open garage, this is for sure that an electric car charger will not work.
An electric car charger only works in garages that have a roof. If your garage does not have a door, it is still possible that an electric car charger can be installed.
Check your car charger's specifications and see if your garage has enough power to maintain the power of the car charger.
If you share a garage with a neighbor or 100 other tenants, there might be an electric car charger installed. If not, you can install one yourself. Just know that somebody else can use the car charger, unless if you call it your own private property.

, If all else fails and you still want an electric car, try looking around your neighborhood and find any nearby electric car charging stations. You technically don't need your own electric car charger to own an electric car. As long as security isn't a worry for you, you are fine.

Only do this at your own risk!

, When you have made the decision to install an electric car charger in your garage, go contact your dealership as soon as possible.

More electric cars are being used every year, but gasoline and diesel vehicles are still the norm of the car business. Your nearby car dealership may not be ready to install your electric car charger immediately, so it is better to tell your dealership now so that you can get the installation done as soon as possible.

,

Many dealerships will start off with ""Is your garage compatible with the car charger?"" If so, tell them that your garage is compatible, and don't tell them what type your garage is yet. Only be more specific if they ask more questions.

,

A 4 square sheet has 4 squares, each square for a different category that you need to look at and approve with your signature. 4 square sheets are not what you call an actual contract paper. If you receive this paper, just simply decline and walk away, and try again at a later date, at a different dealership if possible.

, This allows the dealership to say a problem with your house configuration, only if your garage is part of the house.

If the dealership says that your house fixtures can interfere with the car charger, that means your garage is not compatible.

, You can relax now, and wait until a workman arrives., If you see anything suspicious or anything dangerous that is happening, report to the engineer immediately. For an extra note, contact the dealership and any friends nearby."

Test the charging system with a Voltmeter.,
If you suspect current is leaking and discharging the battery, check it with the current measuring part of a multimeter.,
The current may be too small for the highest range of the meter.",How to Handle Dead Battery Problems,"


Connect the red cable to the positive terminal, black to negative. If you have a ""green eye"" charge indicator on the battery, charge until it turns green. If not, disconnect the charger for half an hour and check the voltage (engine stopped) - 12.6 Volts indicates a full charge, 12.3 Volts half charged. Use a multimeter set to a DC Voltage range greater than 12 Volts full scale.
Touch the red probe to the positive side of the battery, black to the negative side. A typical 5 amp charger may take more than 8 hours to charge the battery. More powerful chargers are for expert users, because they may blow up the battery! A tiny 1 amp cigarette lighter charger may be left connected indefinitely.;
, A buildup of white powder between the terminal and the cable prevents a large current from flowing to the starter. Clean with a wet rag with baking soda sprinkled on. Use fine sandpaper if necessary. Be very careful when using metal tools near the positive terminal - avoid shorting the terminal to any metal part of the car.

, With the car running put the multimeter on a DC Voltage range greater than 14 Volts and touch the probes to the battery terminals. The Voltage should be between 14.0 and 14.5 Volts for effective charging. If below 14, you probably need a new alternator. Above, you need a mechanic to adjust it.

, This is a little more complicated. Engine off for all this!


Cover the positive battery terminal with a rag so you can't accidentally touch it.
Use a wrench to disconnect the cable from the negative battery terminal.
Set the meter to the largest DC current range (at least 10 Amperes; this may involve plugging the probe wire to a different jack in the meter).
Use clips to connect the red probe to the disconnected cable and the black probe to the negative battery terminal. The current will then flow through the meter to the car, enabling the meter to measure the current. When first connected, the current may be large. An open door will draw at least 5 amperes for the interior lights, and the lights may stay on for several minutes after closing the doors.
If you have an under hood light, disconnect it or remove the bulb. The current should go down to near zero. Most cars draw only 0.010 Amperes (10 mA) for the clock. Anything under 50 mA is alright. While watching the meter, rock the car, pat the fuse box, wiggle the doors (without opening). A current of even half an Ampere indicates a problem.

, If you know the current is less than 1 Ampere, you can switch the meter down to the 1 Amp range. Be careful with lower ranges such as 100 mA - it is very easy to burn out that range on the meter with excessive current. If you have to move the probe lead to a different jack on the meter, you must use a clip lead to connect the black and red leads to each other during the move so the car maintains its connection to the battery and doesn't draw its larger initial current when connected again. At a current of .05 amperes (50 mA), a battery will take 700 hours (30 days) to half discharge. If your car's current is that low, you do not have a discharge problem. Do check that underhood light to make sure it goes off when the hood is closed. Or leave it disconnected.

Label and number each wire with tape and its matching hole with the same number, then you could remove all of the spark plugs at once. Don't remove the wire from the distributor unless you accurately number each outlet to match the plug and its cable.;
,,


90% strength alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits are good choices that all work well when cleaning spark plugs.

, Rinse well, brush, dig out any goop with a thin wire. Use the alcohol, brake or carburetor/injector cleaner or mineral spirits to quickly displace water to dry them. Dry well.


Buy HCl available in a quite stronger liquid solution called Muriatic Acid, or Hydrochloric Acid (exact same stuff), at a hardware store, home building supply/lumberyard).Caution: Only dilute any strong acid by pouring it into water (the opposite can cause popping/splattering) of drops of strong solution.

,


Canned pressurized air will work well to remove tiny bits of debris if you don't have an air compressor.

,


This is an important step to take even when cleaning spark plugs that appear to be clean.

,


This extra blast of air simply eliminates any debris left on the spark plugs.

,


Gap the clean spark plugs to your automobile's specifications using a spark plug gap tool.

,


If the holes are extremely dirty, you can use the same solution to clean them that you used for your spark plugs.

, Double-check that each wire/cable is replaced onto the correct spark plug as your go.

You will need to have a replacement key cut as soon as possible., This is not the same as copying your key. A code key is where the locksmith or dealership cuts a key that exactly matches your key when it was new. If the code key fixes your problem, then you had a bad key. If it does not you likely have a bad cylinder.If you have a spare key that is rarely or never used, you can try this in place of a code key.
If you have a second key that is used often, it is likely worn similarly to your first key. It would be a good idea to have a code key cut in this case.

, If the code or spare key fixed the problem, then your cylinder is likely fine. Since an unused spare or a code key is the same as the original key in pristine condition, if they do not work then the problem is in your cylinder. In this case, you either need to replace your cylinder yourself or take it to a repair shop.

Some batteries are located lower in the engine compartment, behind the front bumper and ahead of the front wheels. These are sometimes accessed from the bottom and need to be removed for service.
Most BMW and Mercedes Benz batteries and a few others are located in the trunk, concealed in an isolated compartment.
Batteries may also be located under the rear seat, such as in some Cadillacs.;
, Before you check the water levels, clean any dirt or debris from the top of the battery and around the battery terminals. This is important, as you do not want any foreign material entering the battery cells when you open them. This is also important because a clean battery surface helps slow or stop corrosion on nearby metal.









For general cleaning of road grime and minor corrosion, use an ammonia-based window cleaner. Spray the cleaner on your rag — not on the battery itself — and wipe away any dirt. Paper towels can be used as long as you replace them before they disintegrate to bits.
Heavy corrosion can be cleaned with a paste of baking soda and water. Again, wet the rag and wipe, do not soak the battery with baking soda. Sometimes it takes many repetitions of wetting the rag and wiping. Follow up by cleaning with a rag dampened with window cleaner to remove the baking soda. Leaving a residue of baking soda on the exterior of the battery will speed up future corrosion of the terminals and nearby metal.
Don't get ahead of yourself here — be sure the covers are on the battery ports at this stage of cleaning. Do not let cleaning fluids drip or flow into the battery through the ports.


Note: If you prefer, you can remove the battery from the car before cleaning and performing this maintenance, and reinstall it afterwards. This may be safer, especially if the battery is in an awkward location. This will reset some or all of the electronics in the car however (clock, radio station presets, etc.). If the battery can be serviced without removing it from the car, this usually saves considerable time overall.
You can also remove the battery terminals from the battery and dip them in a cup of very hot water. The hot water will melt away the corrosion, leaving a clean surface. Make sure you the terminals are completely dry before replacing them on the battery.

, On top of the battery are typically two semi-rectangular plastic covers used to seal each battery cell port. These can be removed by gently prying with plastic putty knife or a screwdriver. Try prying from a number of points around the periphery of the cover if the cover does not immediately come loose.









Some batteries have six individual round covers instead. These can be removed by twisting counter-clockwise, and then lifting them out.
If the battery is labeled as ""maintenance free,"" it is not designed to be opened. Manufacturers advise that water cannot be added to these batteries, they simply need to be replaced if they stop working well.

, Removing the port covers may reveal more dirt on the top of the battery. Continue cleaning by wiping away from the ports with a rag dampened with window cleaner.









Do not use baking soda for this cleaning. Use a small amount of window cleaner, and be very careful to prevent anything (cleaner, dirt, bits of paper towel, etc.) from entering the ports.
Don't be tempted to skip this step — keeping the top of the battery clean will reduce future corrosion. This is an important aspect of battery maintenance for preserving the integrity of the connections.

, By looking down into each port you can see the electrolyte level of each individual cell. Each cell is supposed to be covered in an equal amount of fluid.









If this is not the case it could have been caused simply by accidental overfilling previously, in which case the problem is easily corrected by proper filling later, after the overfilled level has gone down in normal service to the normal range.
If fluid levels are obviously unequal, it is also possible that the battery may have a small fluid leak or a cracked case. If so the battery needs to be replaced. If there is no obvious leakage, fill the battery to the maximum safe level, using distilled water only, and check again in a few weeks to see if the levels have remained uniform.

, The electrolyte is too low if any part of the plates is exposed to air. If the plates are not fully covered with electrolyte, then the battery cannot operate at full capacity.


Exposing the plates to air ruins the area exposed to air in a matter of days.
If the electrolyte is only about 1/2 inch (1 cm) below the top of the plates, adding enough water to the battery to just cover the plates may return it to serviceable condition at a slightly reduced capacity. (Instructions for adding water follow in Part 3 of this wiki article.) Otherwise, you will need to consider replacing the battery.
A low electrolyte level could be caused by overcharging, so if this is the case, you should consider having your alternator checked.

, The normal fluid level is about 1/2 inch (1 cm) above the tops of the plates or about 1/8 inch (3 mm) below the bottoms of the filler tubes that extend down from the port openings.


If this is the case it may not be worth the effort to fill the battery at this time. Just replace the port covers and inspect again in three months.

, The maximum safe fluid level is just touching the bottom of the filler tubes.


Most filler tubes have a pair of slots in the side somewhere near the bottom of the tube. This causes the meniscus (the little bit of liquid that bends up near the edge of the tube) to have a distinctive eye-shape if the fluid is touching the filler tube, whereas there is no meniscus if the fluid is below the bottom of the filler tube.
The eye-shaped meniscus is designed as a signal to stop filling. You may need to use a flashlight to see the fluid level and the presence or absence of the meniscus clearly.

, You should always follow the advice of your battery dealer or the battery manufacturer if it conflicts with the information provided in this article.


Also be aware that batteries for golf carts, floor cleaning machines, and nickel cadmium batteries especially may require other electrolyte levels.

, Distilled water can be purchased at most grocery stores. If the electrolyte levels in the cells are low (plates are exposed), fill each cell to just cover the plates. Then use a battery charger to recharge the battery, or just drive the car for a few days in normal service. Only fill to the maximum safe level — just touching the bottoms of the filler tubes — if the battery is fully charged.









Use a clean funnel, sports bottle, turkey baster, etc. to ensure control of the flow and accuracy of the final level when filling each port. Be very careful to prevent any dirt or cleaning agents from getting into the cells.
Using tap water, well water, filtered water, or anything but distilled water, will introduce minerals and chemicals (e.g. chlorine if it is city water) and other contaminates that will result in decreased battery life., If you are adding water because the battery is weak or dead, it is better to fill it just enough to cover the plates (or leave it alone if it is at a normal level).


When a weak or dead battery is charged the electrolyte level will rise, therefore you should allow space for the level to rise when you charge the battery. (This does not happen to a fully charged battery.)
Electrolyte levels can also rise if the battery gets hot.

, Ensure all areas are clean and free from dirt or debris, then place cleaned port covers back onto the battery.









If you accidentally overfilled the battery but there is no overflow onto the top surface of the battery, the best thing to do is just to stop filling and let it be. If there was an overflow onto the top of the battery, remember that the overflow is acidic — do not let it touch your skin or clothing.
Clean it with a rag or with paper towels by wiping away from the ports. Do not let the rag or paper towels get wet enough to drip on other parts of the car or anything. Rinse the rag or paper towel in a pail of water. Wear gloves—don't get the water on your hands.
After the job is done, discard the rinsed-out rag or paper towel in the regular trash. Pour the water down a drain, being careful not to splash the water around. You do not want to take a chance that the residue of acid will get on something else. Finally, clean anything that the overflow contacted with a rag dampened with window cleaner.
Visually inspect any overfilled battery weekly for a month to see if there is any further overflow, and clean any overflow as described above if necessary.
The sulfuric acid lost from the battery by an accidental overflow is probably a small enough amount as to be immaterial to the operation of the battery. It is best not to attempt to add acid to to replace the loss. (Too much acid shortens the life of the battery more than too little.)

, The electrolyte in the battery is sulfuric acid, so it is extremely important that none of this liquid gets into your eyes, as it could cause significant damage or even blindness.








Contact lenses afford you no protection and may complicate an accident. Ordinary glasses do not protect adequately due to the lack of side shields.
Therefore, it's essential to wear safety goggles, which can be purchased at most hardware stores.

, Choose a glove-type that can stand up to sulfuric acid for at least a few minutes. These can be found at hardware stores.









Latex and vinyl gloves will not stand up to acid long. If you use latex or vinyl gloves, change the glove immediately upon noticing a splash on it. Given time, a splash of electrolyte will soak through the glove and burn your skin.
Neoprene gloves offer protection for an hour or more, but are harder to find at ordinary hardware stores. Nitrile is not the same as Neoprene. Nitrile gloves offer less protection from sulfuric acid than latex, and should not be used.

, Wear old clothing with long sleeves, long pants, and closed toe shoes to cover as much skin as possible. If any electrolyte splashes on your clothing the fabric will rot away in about a week or two, leaving a hole, so wear old clothes that you can sacrifice.








, If any electrolyte splashes on your skin, immediately wash it with running water and soap.









If you feel a burning or tingling sensation on your skin anywhere, you may have splashed a drop of electrolyte on yourself. It only takes a drop to cause a burn.
You may not be able to see any redness or injury until it is too late, so if you suspect you may have splashed yourself, take a break from your work and wash immediately rather than taking a chance.
Dispose of all used gloves and rags when the job is done. Leaving these in contact with other materials could cause damage.

Buy a voltmeter.,
Check the battery first.,
Start the vehicle and rev the engine to 2,000 RPM.,
Keep the engine running and retest the battery with the voltmeter.",How to Check an Alternator1," You can find one at any auto parts store for less than $20.Don't worry about getting an expensive one; a cheap voltmeter will do for this purpose.









If you have a multimeter, you can use that instead. A multimeter measures voltage as well as other electrical properties such as current and resistance. You want to measure voltage when you're checking your alternator.;
, The battery is needed to start the vehicle, which, in turn spins the alternator at sufficient speed to keep the battery charged. This means that if your battery is too low, you will be unable to start the vehicle and thus you will also be unable to test the alternator, rendering any additional voltmeter-testing totally useless. If the weather is cold or your battery is old, your battery could be the issue and your alternator might be just fine. That's why you need to check the battery before checking the alternator.Here's how to do it:









Turn off the car. You'll want to make sure your engine is off before attaching the voltmeter.
Open the hood.
Connect the voltmeter to the battery. Place the red lead of the voltmeter to the positive battery terminal and the black lead to the negative terminal. Avoid touching your skin to the battery.
Read the voltmeter. If the battery reads above 12.2 volts, it has enough juice to start the alternator, which can then be tested with the voltmeter.
If the battery doesn't have enough voltage, either get the battery charged and re-test or try a different method for checking the alternator.

, This will draw power on your battery, which should cause your voltage regulator to kick the alternator into high gear.








, When you read the voltmeter this time, the voltage should go up to at least 13. If varying the RPMs causes the voltage to fluctuate between 13 and 14.5 volts, your alternator is in good shape; if, on the other hand, the voltage remains the same or decreases, your alternator isn’t working properly.








Repeat the process with the lights, radio, and AC on. The alternator is charging if the battery voltage stays above 13 volts with the engine at 2,000 rpm and all accessories on.

Check the alternator gauge.,
Listen to the alternator while the engine is running.,
Turn the radio on and rev the engine.,
Find an auto-parts store that tests alternators for free.",How to Check an Alternator2," If you have a volt/amp gauge, it will read the alternator output for you. Run engine at 2,000 rpms for tests and turn on the blower fan for the AC or Heater, the headlamps, and any other accessories that put a strain on the alternator, and watch the gauge to see if it decreases voltage or amperage. As a rule, if the voltmeter is higher when the engine is running than when the engine is not, you can confidently assume that the alternator is charging.

, If there is a problem with the bearings you may hear a squealing sound coming from the front of the car, which becomes louder with more electrical accessories using power at the same time.

, Tune your radio to a low number on the AM band with no music. If the radio whines or goes fuzzy whenever you hit the gas, the alternator is quite likely the culprit.

, Since every store would love for you to buy your new alternator from them, many will try to get the edge-up on their competitors by offering free testing. Dismount your alternator and bring it in to be sure.

Turn off the functional car that contains the charged battery.










",How to Charge a Dead Car Battery1," Your battery should be intact with no cracks, and should not visibly leak any battery acid.


Do not attempt to jump-start your car if your battery displays signs of these damages, as you may cause injury to yourself or others if you do so.;
, Goggles and gloves will protect your eyes and hands from any sulfuric acid that may eject from the battery.


,











If your battery cables are corroded, clean them as best as possible using a brush with stiff bristles.

, Ideal positions for this task are either placing the cars closely next to one another facing the same direction, or facing one another head-on, or nose-to-nose.











Verify that the distance between each car's battery is close enough for the jumper cables to connect the cars together. The length of jumper cables varies greatly depending on their style and manufacturer.

Do not attempt to connect two different pairs of jumper cable together if your first pair isn’t long enough. This can melt the jumper cables and start a fire.

Look for a battery at an auto parts store.,
Evaluate what the battery will be used for.,
Check in the RVs owner’s manual.,
Choose a traditional wet cell battery.,
Choose a valve regulated lead acid battery.,
Look for a battery with a high maximum reserve capacity.",How to Buy RV Batteries1," The chassis battery in your RV serves the same purpose as the automotive battery in any vehicle. These batteries can be purchased at your local auto parts stores and usually cost between $50 and $300, depending on the type of battery you choose and the brand. Ask the clerk at the front desk to look up your RV in their system to offer you suggestions about the battery options you have.Some large retailers also have automotive sections you can purchase chassis batteries in.
Make sure to tell the clerk what vehicle you intend to put the battery in, as that’s important to ensure it will fit in the engine bay and provide the necessary power.;
, A chassis battery is sometimes referred to as a “starter battery” in RVs. This battery is used primarily to start the engine that propels the RV when you’re driving and serves the same purpose as the battery in your car or truck. Like cars and trucks, any modifications you’ve made to the electrical system of the vehicle may require further consideration when choosing a new battery.Determine if you have made any modifications that may result in an increased draw from the battery when starting.

, Just like cars and trucks, RVs come with an owner’s manual that can provide specifications about what type of battery you should choose as your chassis battery. It’s important to look for a battery that matches the specifications laid out in the owner’s manual to ensure you purchase a battery with the proper amount of cranking amperage, or the correct amount of initial power output, to start your RVs engine.If you do not have the owner’s manual for your RV, try looking on the RV manufacturer’s website.
RV specialty stores can often look up the proper type of battery for your RV.
Understand that this battery is primarily used to power the starter motor, and likely won’t be involved in powering any of the electrical devices in the RV.

, Wet or flooded cell batteries are the most common types of automotive batteries. The vehicle you drive every day likely came with a wet cell battery. These batteries offer the lowest relative cost and are sometimes even sealed, meaning they require no maintenance beyond regular charging to maintain.A traditional wet cell battery is likely what your RV came with from the factory.
Some wet cell batteries are not sealed and require service from time to time to maintain.
Wet cell batteries offer low cost and reliability.

, Valve regulated lead acid batteries, or VRLA batteries, are named as such because of the internal safety valves built into the battery. These batteries come in two primary types: gel and AGM (Absorbed Gas Mat). These batteries can be more reliable than wet cell batteries because they are designed to prevent any fluid loss. These batteries do not require ventilation as some wet cell batteries may and also do not require any maintenance service.Gel cell batteries maintain a charge well, but do not offer as powerful an initial or cranking amperage as their AGM counterparts.
AGM batteries contain gas instead of gel, and can produce a higher cranking amperage.

, While the amperage required of your battery is determined by the design of the engine, one thing you should look into when shopping for RV batteries is the maximum reserve capacity (RC). This rating is often not provided on the battery’s label and you may need to ask for assistance at your local auto parts store to find the batteries with the highest rated reserves. A battery with a 120 minute reserve capacity means it can operate your electronics for that long without the engine running before being depleted.Because you may want to use some of the electronics connected to the engine’s electrical system while parked, a high reserve capacity is important.
You can find batteries’ maximum reserve capacity information on the battery maker’s websites.

Open the hood or compartment on each vehicle in which the batteries are located.










,
Take note of the positive and negative terminals on each battery.,
Connect each end of the positive jumper cable to the positive terminals on each car battery.,
Connect one end of the negative jumper cable to the negative terminal on the functional, charged battery.,
Attach the other end of the negative jumper cable to a grounded metal component of the car that contains the dead battery.,
Start the engine of the car with the charged battery.,
Allow at least five minutes to pass after starting the engine of the car with the charged battery.,
Try to start the engine of the car that contains the dead battery.,
Disconnect and remove the jumper cables from each car after the engine has started in the reverse order in which you connected them.,
Allow the car which had the dead battery to continue running for at least another five minutes.,
Drive the jump-started car for at least 20 minutes or allow it to idle for the same amount of time.",How to Charge a Dead Car Battery2,", Positive terminals will be indicated by the plus symbol (+), and negative terminals will be indicated by a minus symbol(-).


, The positive jumper cable is usually red in color if it is not labeled otherwise. The order in which you attach the jumper cables does make a difference, so follow this pattern: First connect one end of the positive jumper cable to the dead battery, then connect the other positive end of the jumper cable to the charged battery.


, In most cases, the negative jumper cable is black.










, This will ground the car that contains the dead battery upon jump-starting. You can attach the ground cable to the frame, chassis, or another component that is reasonably clean and free of paint or oxidation.










, Upon starting the engine, its charging system will begin to charge the dead car battery through the jumper cables.










, This will allow the dead battery to build up a charge of its own, although it would take longer to fully charge the battery.










, If the jumper cables and the battery you are charging have enough power, the car engine should turn over easily and start.



If the engine in the car with the dead battery fails to start, allow five more minutes to pass for the dead battery to charge.

, This will prevent sparks or an explosion from occurring.











Disconnect the grounding cable first, then the cable attached to the negative terminal on the battery, then the cable attached to the positive terminal of the battery of the car that provided the jump, and finally the cable attached to the positive terminal on the previously dead battery.

, This will allow the alternator in the car to recharge the battery.


, In some cases, your battery will become fully charged within this time period; however, it is possible that you may need to purchase a new battery for your car if the battery doesn't charge sufficiently to crank the car.

Look for deep cycle batteries at auto parts stores or specialty RV stores.,
Understand the use of a deep-cycle battery in your RV.,
Choose a single 12 volt or two 6 volt batteries.,
Consider using a marine battery.,
Choose a charging option.,
Decide between wet/flooded and VRLA batteries.,
Look for the Amp-Hour and Reserve Capacity ratings.",How to Buy RV Batteries2," Deep cycle batteries are used in a number of applications, so they are carried at most auto parts stores. You may want to shop for deep cycle batteries at specialty RV sales locations however, as their clerks will be more knowledgeable about what you need the batteries to be capable of in order to power the interior of your RV. Ask the clerk at an RV specific retail location for help choosing the best battery for your needs.Deep cycle batteries tend to be slightly more expensive than more common automotive batteries, but can still usually be found for $100 to $400.
Let the clerk at an RV specific retail location know about things that may affect battery life like large televisions or multiple computers that will need to be powered.

, While the chassis or starter battery in your RV is designed to produce a brief but high output of energy to start the engine, deep cycle batteries are designed to produce lower, more consistent levels of output to power electronics and appliances within the RV. These batteries can be recharged more often and drained deeper than chassis batteries without compromising the life of the battery.These batteries power the lights, refrigerators, side motors, water heaters and any other mechanisms that require electricity in the living quarters of your RV.
The batteries powering your living quarters must always produce 12 volt output.

, Deep cycle batteries in your RV must product 12 volts, but you don’t necessarily have to use a single 12 volt battery. Two six volt batteries can be strung together to create the same power output, but can allow for different storage options. Storage space is always an important consideration in RVs, and the design of yours may allow for two small batteries more readily than a single large one.Six volt batteries are often sold for golf carts. These batteries can be strung together to power the living quarters of your RV.
String batteries together by connecting the negative terminal on one to the positive of the next with a wire, then connecting the open terminals on each battery to the vehicle.

, Deep cycle batteries are the best option for powering the living quarters of your RV, but they aren’t the only one. Marine batteries can also be used for this purpose. These batteries can serve as either chassis or living quarters batteries because they are designed to produce both high initial output and consistent long lasting output. They don’t do either as well as batteries designed to do just one thing, but do both well enough for use.Marine batteries are not as efficient as deep cycle batteries, but come at a significantly lower cost.
You cannot deplete marine battery as deeply or as often as you can with deep cycle batteries.

, Deep cycle batteries are designed to tolerate being depleted and recharged often, but the way you choose to recharge your batteries may affect the type of battery you should choose. Many people charge their deep cycle batteries by plugging them into an outlet at their house or a campground, but others opt to use things like solar panels. Plugging your batteries into a power source is the fastest way to charge your batteries, but not all batteries tolerate being charged quickly as well.If you choose to plug your batteries in often to charge, you may want to use a wet cell or AGM battery, as they tolerate fast charging the best.
Gel batteries will tolerate fast charging, but may not last as long.
Trickle chargers can deliver slow charges that are not as harsh on the battery.

, Just like with the chassis battery, there are two main options for battery type when powering the living quarters of your RV. Wet cell batteries offer lower costs, but may occasionally require service to maintain. VRLA batteries come in two forms: gel and AGM and often cost more than traditional wet cell batteries.Gel batteries last longer than wet cell batteries but don’t tolerate fast charging as well. They are usually more expensive than wet cell batteries.
AGM batteries are the most expensive option, but last longer than gel batteries and put up with fast charging as well as wet cell batteries.

, When you know exactly what type of battery you want, make sure to check the Amp-Hour (AH) and Reserve Capacity (RC) ratings to help you choose a specific one. The AH rating is a measure of how many amps the battery you choose will deliver over a span of 20 hours. The RC rating is the length of time the battery you choose can sustain a load of 25 amps.The higher the AH rating, the more things your battery can power.
The higher the RC rating, the longer the battery will last while doing so.

Assess whether or not your wet cell batteries require service.,
Add distilled water to your battery if necessary.,
Charge your batteries when stored.,
Check for overcharging.,
Equalize deep cycle batteries if necessary.",How to Buy RV Batteries3," Most modern wet cell batteries are sealed and considered “maintenance free,” but ones that are not sealed will require occasional service. You can usually easily identify if your battery is sealed or not by looking for rectangular ports on the top of the battery. If there are ports, the battery can be opened and requires maintenance to continue working properly.If there are no ports, the battery is sealed and does not require service.
Never open the ports without first putting on the appropriate safety gear.

, If your battery does require occasional service, you may need to add water to it from time to time to keep it functioning properly. Batteries that are charged and depleted often or operating in high temperature areas will likely require service more often than those that are not. First, check the water levels in the battery, then add distilled water if it is required. Never service your battery without first putting on eye protection and gloves as the fluid inside is corrosive.Remember, many wet cell and all VRLA batteries do not require you to add water at any time.
Always use distilled water when adding fluid to your battery.

, Keeping your batteries charged will help prolong their lifespan and ensure your RV works just the way you want it to when you take it out. Some people choose to remove the batteries from their RVs while storing them, but that isn’t necessary. Plug your RV batteries into a battery maintainer or trickle charger with a storage setting. Never plug any of your RVs batteries into a trickle charger that does not have a maintenance or storage setting, as you run the risk of overcharging them.Your deep cycle and starter batteries can be stored and charged using the same methods.
Make sure the voltage output on the trickle charger or maintainer you choose matches the voltage of the battery or you risk damaging the battery.

, After your battery has been plugged into a maintainer or charger for a week, check on it to ensure it isn’t overcharging. If the battery is warm to the touch or requires fluid be added to it, the charger you chose is introducing too much electricity into the battery. Slight overcharging can reduce the battery’s lifespan, and significant overcharging can cook the battery’s internals and prevent it from holding a charge at all.If the battery seems to be overcharging, disconnect it immediately.
Clerks at most auto parts stores can help you match a trickle charger to the battery you intend to charge.

, Some wet cell deep cycle batteries require equalizing if left for several months without charging. Equalizing a deep cycle battery involves using a high voltage charger at a low current level to break the sulfate crystals off of the inner cells. Doing so requires a special charger and should be done by professionals.Most wet cell, deep cycle batteries do not require equalization. If you are unsure if yours does, check on the manufacturer’s website.
No VRLA batteries require equalization.

Learn what battery size you need for your car's make and model.,
Pick the correct size and type of battery for your driving needs.,
Look for a battery that has been on the store shelf for less than six months.,
Ask about ""cold cranking amps"" (CCA) and ""cranking amps"" (CA).,
Inquire about reserve capacity for the batteries that are in stock.,
Check the difference between maintenance free (sealed) and low maintenance batteries.",How to Buy a Car Battery,"


Consult your car's owner's manual. The manual usually specifies the battery size you should buy.






Ask an auto supply store employee to help you figure out the correct battery size.





;
, Keep driving needs and climate in mind and check your owner's manual for the correct physical size. Consider group size, which refers to the outside dimensions of the battery and the placement of the terminals. If you get a battery that is too small, it won't fit securely in the battery compartment of your car.

High temperatures are hard on car batteries. The electrolyte solution in car batteries evaporates more rapidly in hot climates.






A battery with a long life is important if your daily driving habits are primarily short stop-and-start trips. Short trips don't allow very much time for your battery to recharge. A battery with a long life is better able to withstand those shorter trips.







,


The date stamp code gives you the battery's freshness information. The first two characters are a letter and a digit — A stands for January, B for February, etc.; the digit specifies the year the battery was manufactured — five stands for 2015, six for 2016. The date code is engraved into the cover of the battery. You can find it as you look down at the top of the battery. Some batteries may also have a sticker with the date code.

, These 2 terms are critical, especially if you live in a colder climate.


CCA indicates a battery's ability to start a car in 0°F (-17°C). CCA also tells you how much current the battery delivers to your car's starter.
CA tells you how much current your battery delivers to your car when temperatures are 32°F (0°C). This rating is usually higher than the CCA.
A battery cost increases as the CCA increases. The CCA is relative to how much lead a battery has inside it when it is built; as the lead increases, the CCA increases.

,


Reserve capacity measures how many minutes the battery may run using its power alone. You need to know the reserve capacity in case your car's alternator should fail.

,


Maintenance free batteries do not need to have water added to them.






Low maintenance batteries are unsealed and have caps on top that allow you to add distilled water — an important consideration if you live in a hot climate.

Make sure the battery is the problem.",How to Jump Start a Car1,"


Check the headlights. Are they dim or bright? (Note that in some cars you will need to turn the ignition on to test the headlights). If they are dim, it's likely your battery is the culprit. If your headlights are bright, you do not have a dead battery and a jump start will not help.
Put the key in the ignition and see whether your dashboard lights up as usual. Test the stereo. In most cases, even with a low battery you should see some dashboard lights and get some sound out of the stereo. If you do not get a flicker out of your dashboard, you may have a problem with your ignition switch.
Try to start the car. Does it turn over very slowly, or does it crank quickly? If it cranks quickly, you do not have a dead battery and a jump start will not help. If it cranks slowly, or not at all, you probably have a dead battery.;

"
Open each car's hood and locate the battery.,
Park the working car near, but not touching, the disabled car.,
Put on safety gear (goggles and gloves) if you have it.,
Untangle and unwind your jumper cables.,
Connect the jumper cables in the order described below:


Connect one red clamp to the positive (+) terminal of the dead battery.,
Start the working car.,
Try to start the disabled vehicle.,
Remove the jumper cables once the car starts.,
Keep the recently-disabled car's engine running.",How to Jump Start a Car2," On most cars, it will be near the front of the car on the right or left side, but on some cars the battery is located near the firewall between the engine and passenger compartment. In some cars the battery is located in the trunk. If unsure, check your car manual for location of the battery. Identify the positive and negative terminals.


The positive terminal will be marked with a plus sign (+) and will usually have a red cable attached on it.
The negative terminal will be marked with a minus sign (-) and will usually have a black cable attached to it.

, Park the car in such a way that the distance between both car batteries is as small as possible. Turn off the engine, radio, lights, A/C, fans and all other electrical components. Make sure that all of these things are off in the disabled car, too. Don't let the cars touch at all.


If the cars are touching, jumping the battery can cause a dangerous electrical arc between the vehicles.

, Inspect batteries for cracks, leaks or other damage. If you find any of these things, do not jump start the car. Call a tow truck instead or replace the battery.


It may be necessary to remove the disabled automobile's battery cables from the battery terminals and clean both cables and terminals. Use a stiff wire brush to remove all corrosion. Reconnect the cables to the battery terminals and jump the car.
Remove any positive (+) red post protective covers if applicable.

, Like your battery, your jumper cables will probably have red and black cables and will have heavy-duty clamps to connect to the battery terminals. You must make sure that the red and black ends of your jumper cables never touch each other once they are connected to the batteries; permitting them to do so can result in serious arcing and/or damage to one or both cars.

,
Connect the other red clamp to the positive (+) terminal of the good battery.
Connect one black clamp to the negative (-) terminal of the good battery.
Connect the other black clamp to a piece of grounded metal on the dead car, preferably the bolt where the thick negative cable from the battery connects to the chassis. If this is not practical, look for shiny metal (not painted or oily) that is attached to the engine. Usually a nut, bolt or other protruding shiny metal will work. You may see a small spark when you connect to a good ground. As a last resort, you may connect to the negative (-) post of the dead battery, but this risks igniting hydrogen gas coming off the battery.
Make sure none of the cables are dangling into the engine compartment, where they could be exposed to moving parts.

, Let it idle for a few minutes. Do not race the engine, but do rev the engine a little above idle for 30 to 60 seconds. You do this to charge the battery in the dead car, because the starter in the dead car will draw most of the required current (well in excess of 100 amps) from that battery, not through the cables. Common retail jumper cables are not built to pass the current required. Charging the dead battery is a must. If 30 seconds doesn't do it, try charging for the full 60 seconds by keeping the engine at a high idle. A good, clean connection between the battery cables and the battery terminals is essential.

, If it does not start, shut the engine off and disconnect the last connection temporarily while you slightly twist or wiggle each of the four clamps to help ensure a good electrical connection. Restart the working car again. Allow another five minutes for charging before attempting to start the disabled vehicle. If this does not work after a few tries, you may need to have the car towed or the battery replaced.

, Do this in the reverse of the order in which they were attached, and don't let any of the cables or clamps touch each other (or dangle into the engine compartment).


Disconnect the black clamp from grounded metal on the dead car.
Disconnect the black clamp from the negative (-) terminal of the good battery.
Disconnect the red clamp from the positive (+) terminal of the good battery.
Disconnect the red clamp from the positive (+) terminal of the dead battery.
Replace any positive (+) red post protective covers if applicable. These covers help prevent accidental short circuiting the battery.

, Run the car above idle (slightly revved up with your foot on the gas) for five minutes and then on or above idle for 20 minutes before turning it off. This should give the battery enough charge to start the car again. If it does not, you probably have a dead battery or a dying alternator.

Position the car at the top of a hill, or have people push the car.

,
Depress the clutch completely.,
Put the car in second gear.,
Turn on the ignition but don't start the engine.This is also known as key position two.,
Let go of the brakes.,
Let go of the clutch quickly when the speed reaches 5 mph (8.0 km/h).The engine should turn and start.",How to Jump Start a Car3,",,, The key is inserted and turned one step to the right. Turning one step further would start the engine, which you don't want to do.

, Keep the clutch depressed. You'll start coasting down the hill or moving due to people pushing., If it doesn't, try depressing and releasing the clutch again.

Ensure the vehicle is in park.,
Inspect the key for damage.,
Ensure there is nothing stuck to the key.,
Check to see if the steering wheel is locked.,
Wiggle the wheel back and forth while turning the key.",How to Fix an Ignition Key That Doesn't Turn1," Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission are designed not to start if the transmission is not in park or neutral. Starting a car while in drive could result in the vehicle lurching forward, causing damage or injuring someone. Check your shift lever to ensure it is completely in park or neutral, then attempt to turn the key again. Be sure the indicator on the shift lever is pointing at the “P” for park.
Try taking the vehicle out of park and putting it back in if you can, then turn the key again.;
, If your key won’t turn when you insert it into the ignition, it may be because the key has been damaged and no longer engages the correct pins to the depth necessary to spin the cylinder. Examine the key for signs of excessive wear, rounding or broken teeth. Any of these could result in the key failing to turn in the ignition.If the key is damaged, it will have to be replaced.
Some keys require programming from the dealership when replaced. Refer to your owner’s manual to check the requirements for your vehicle.

, Just as worn or damaged teeth can prevent the key from turning, anything stuck to the key will also cause it to improperly engage the pins in the ignition cylinder. If you used your key to open a package recently, for instance, there may be bits of tape stuck to the teeth of the key, preventing it from working.Clean any debris or dirt off of the key, then re-insert it and try again.
Do not use your keys to open packages or do anything else other than start your vehicle.

, If you were applying any pressure to the steering wheel when you turned the car off, it may have locked the wheel in place with the steering pin. Check to see if your steering wheel is locked by trying to turn the wheel. If it will not move, or moves only very slightly, it is likely locked. A locked steering wheel will not allow the ignition to engage.When you move the wheel back and forth, you will feel it stop abruptly as it comes into contact with the steering wheel lock.
If your wheel was turned slightly without you applying any pressure when you turned the car off, it still may engage the steering wheel lock.

, In order to unlock the steering wheel, insert the key into the ignition and attempt to turn it. While applying light pressure to the key, wiggle the steering wheel back and forth until the lock disengages. This will allow the steering wheel and the key to turn.The key will be able to turn freely in the ignition once the steering wheel is unlocked.
If the key still fails to turn after the wheel is unlocked, there is another issue.

Use a professional car wash with handheld pressure wands.,
Start at the top and work your way down.,
Clean the undercarriage carefully.,
Dry the car before leaving the car wash.",How to Wash Your Car in the Wintertime1," While you can wash your car at home, it is best to use a professional car wash. Make sure you choose a car wash that has handheld pressure wands. This will help you remove corrosive agents from your car’s body and undercarriage., Begin by washing the roof of your car with the handheld pressure wand. Then work your way down, cleaning the sides and hood of the car. Next wash the car’s undercarriage. And finally, wash the car’s tires and wheel wells., Salt, grime, and chemicals from roadways can collect in the crevices and corners of your car’s undercarriage. When you wash your car, make sure you get down on your knees and wash the undercarriage with the handheld pressure wand. This will help remove salt and other corrosive agents., If you use a tunnel-style car wash, it will likely dry your car with powerful blowers after the wash. If the car wash you use does not have blowers, towel-dry the car after you clean it.If you use a full service car wash, ask the attendant to dry the areas around the trunk, inside of the doors, and power antenna to prevent freezing.

Pull the key out slightly before turning it.,
Wiggle the key back and forth as you turn it.,
Flatten a bent key using a wooden or rubber mallet.,
Gently slide the key in and out a number of times.,
Have a new key cut to the original numbers.",How to Fix an Ignition Key That Doesn't Turn2," If the key is beginning to wear, you may still be able to engage the pins needed to start the vehicle by inserting the key all the way, then pulling it back out slightly. Try to pull the key back out 1/16 of an inch, or approximately the width of a nickel, then attempt to turn it again.If this works, the key is likely over worn.
You should still replace the key as soon as you can before it stops working.

, If pulling the key out a bit fails to make the key turn, try wiggling it up and down slightly to engage the pins in the ignition. Be careful not to apply too much pressure. Wiggling the key can make the key contact the pins from a different angle, which may allow you start the vehicle.If wiggling the key works, it means the teeth on the key are too worn to properly engage the pins.
Replace the key as soon as possible if this works before the key stops working entirely.

, If the key is bent, it may make it impossible to insert it completely or turn the ignition cylinder. Lay the key down on a flat, sturdy surface like a strong table. Take a heavy rubber or wooden mallet and strike the key from above to flatten it against the table.You may have to strike the key multiple times in order to flatten it entirely.
Avoid using pliers or a vice to straighten the key, as you may bend it too far in the opposite direction and reduce the strength of the key.

, If there was any debris stuck to the key when you inserted it, it may have gotten caught in the pins of the ignition cylinder. Insert the key completely, then slide it back out. Repeat the process a few times to try to move any debris that may be caught in the cylinder.If this works, the issue will likely continue to occur until the debris is cleaned out from the ignition cylinder.

, If the key is too damaged to work, you will not be able to have it copied. A copy of a worn or damaged key will also fail to start the vehicle. Instead, you will need to have a new key cut by a dealership that services your make and model vehicle. Depending on the vehicle, the dealership may be able to produce a new key using your vehicle’s VIN number.You will need to provide sufficient evidence of ownership of the vehicle.
If a new key cannot be produced, you will need to purchase a new ignition module with matching key and have it installed.

"
Use canned air to clean the ignition port.,
Use a small dose of electrical cleaner in the key hole.,
Have the ignition cylinder replaced.",How to Fix an Ignition Key That Doesn't Turn3," If there is any debris caught in the ignition cylinder, it may cause the key to fail to engage the pins properly to turn. Purchase canned air from a local retail or office supply store and insert the straw from the nozzle directly into the key hole. Spray the canned air into the key hole in short spurts. It should only take a few short sprays to clean out any debris.Do not spray the entire can into the key hole. The extreme cold could result in damage to the ignition cylinder.
Wear eye protection when using canned air to clean the key hole to ensure no debris gets into your eyes.

, If the ignition cylinder has seized, spraying a small amount of electrical cleaner into the key hole may lubricate it enough to turn. Be careful not to spray too much into the key hole. A few short squirts should suffice. Once done, insert the key and turn it back and forth gently to work the lubricant in.If this works, you may need to replace the ignition cylinder soon as it gets progressively worse.

, If all else fails, you will need to have your ignition cylinder replaced. Have your vehicle towed to a nearby repair facility that specializes in your make and model of vehicle. Explain the issue and discuss your options.Just like having a new key cut, you will need to demonstrate sufficient ownership of the vehicle in order to have a new ignition cylinder installed.
A new ignition cylinder will likely require replacing your key, even if it wasn’t the issue.

Wash your car twice per month to prevent corrosion.,
Wash the car after coming into contact with ice-melting compounds.,
Maintain your car’s fluids during the winter.,
Try using rubber interior mats in the winter.",How to Wash Your Car in the Wintertime2," It is important that you wash your car regularly, especially during the winter months. Salt and other compounds used to melt snow and ice on the roads can cause damage to your car. Salt, in particular, can cause rust and corrosion if left untreated. Try washing your car every two weeks or at least twice each month., While it is important to keep up with regular car washes during the winter, it’s normal to get behind. However, it is extremely important that you wash the car as soon as possible after it comes into contact with salt or other ice-melting substances. This will help prevent rust and corrosion., It’s important that you are on top of fluid maintenance during the winter. Some fluids, like windshield wiper fluid, can freeze in the reservoir or on the windshield itself. Try swapping it for a wiper fluid that contains de-icing agents., Snow, salt, and moisture can wreak havoc on your car’s interior mats. Moisture can also seep under the mats and cause the car to rust. To protect your car’s frame and interior mats, replace your car’s interior mats with rubber ones during the winter."
"
Wax your car for an extra layer of protection.,
Lubricate your locks, trunk, and gas cap before washing the car.,
Avoid washing your car in freezing temperatures.",How to Wash Your Car in the Wintertime3," After washing your car, consider adding a protective wax to the exterior. Wax can help protect your car’s exterior from the salt and other ice-melting chemicals that are applied to roadways during the wintertime., Some people are hesitant about washing their car in freezing temperatures. This is often due to a fear that washing might cause door locks, gas caps, or trunks to freeze. Prevent possible freezing by lubricating these parts of your car with WD-40., It is important that you do not wash your car’s engine in extremely cold temperatures. If there is any deficiency in the car’s wiring system it might show up with the excess moisture, causing the car to not start. Water will also freeze as it hits your car, making it extremely challenging to de-ice windows.If you must wash your car in freezing temperatures, try driving around the block a few times to warm up the car’s hood.
You can also leave the car running during the car wash, which may help prevent the water from immediately freezing.

Make sure the battery needs to be replaced.,
Buy the correct replacement battery.",How to Change a Car Battery1," You don't want to spend time and money installing a new battery if the problem is not with the battery itself. Take the following three things into consideration:

Look for sulfate build-up in the form of a whitish or blue residue around the terminal — removing this can sometimes solve issues with a faulty battery. This residue may indicate a bad seal around the battery terminals and is leaking the acid out onto the terminals. Note: do not touch this powder with your bare hands, as it can often contain dried out sulfuric acid which will begin to burn your skin.



 


Verify that the battery has been given the chance to recharge properly by driving constantly for 30 minutes (with minimal electrical usage, including the air conditioner).
Finally, you should check the alternator. Some cars also have a battery meter, with the engine running, the alternator usually maintains a charge close to 13.8 – 14.2 volts in a properly functioning charging system. The battery should have 12.4 – 12.8 volts with the engine off, and with no accessory load.





;
, Find out what kind of battery you're replacing (or the dimensions of your battery) and bring this, your car's make, model and engine size information to a local auto parts store. This is important because automotive batteries vary in size and electrical capacity and you will want to purchase a battery which matches the size of the battery tray/support in your vehicle.

In some areas of the US, you will be charged a ""core"" fee when you purchase a new battery, if you bring in your old battery after or when purchasing your new battery you will not get charged this fee.

Fold your micro-fiber cloth.,
Wipe in one direction to pick up the dirt.,
Repeat these steps for each section of the car.,
Perform a second buff on each section, if necessary.",How to Wash Your Car Without Water," If your car is caked in mud, a waterless car wash will not help and might even scratch the paint of your car. Only use a waterless product if you have minimal dirt or dust. Otherwise, rinse your car with water to remove dry dirt, then use the waterless product.;
, Many waterless products have wax in them, which will give your car an extra layer of protection while you wash it. If you normally wax your car after you wash it, this could be a time-saver.

, UV rays can damage your paint by causing fading and oxidation. While wax will help protect your car’s paint from UV rays, some formulas have an extra degree of protection., There are also very successful organic, natural waterless products that you can use in your home or inside the car as well as on windows. These may be less damaging to your paint; you can find them at car shops or many home improvement stores.

, These products can be found at most auto stores, Walmart, or online. If you’re having trouble finding a waterless car wash in stores, some examples of products are Dri Wash'n Guard, Meguiar’s Ultimate Wash & Wax Anywhere, and Triplewax Waterless Wash & Shine.

, Micro-fibers are tiny fibers that collect dirt. Use a minimum weight of 300gsm (grams per square meter). Make sure it is clean. Lower quality or dirty towels can scratch your car or leave undesirable swirl patterns. You can also find a chamois cloth instead of a micro-fiber. Any product that absorbs liquid without scratching is ideal.

, Some formulas require diluting with water, while others are ready-to-use. Read the instructions on the bottle to see which one you have.

, If you bought a large bottle of waterless car wash, you will need to transfer some into a spray bottle. Otherwise, most products already come in a spray bottle.

, Divide the car into distinct sections to make it more manageable and to make sure you don’t miss any spots. Here’s one way to divide the car, but you can do it any way you’d like:


The side glass
The roof
The hood and trunk
The upper half of the side doors
The lower half of the side doors
The front bumper
The rear bumper
The wheels

, Use as much waterless car wash fluid as you need to cover the section. If there is some dirt on the paint, you can put a little bit of water to help loosen it up so that you don’t overuse the fluid.


For the tires, you may need to use additional fluid. Be sure to save the tires for last, as they will be the dirtiest.

, You want to maximize the number of clean surfaces on the cloth. Every time you start wiping, you’ll want to use a new, clean side, so as not to reintroduce dirt. Otherwise you will be working against yourself and will actually rub dirt into your paint.Assuming your cloth is large enough, you can fold it twice in half to have 8 useable sides. When the front and back are dirty, unfold and refold it to reveal the clean sides.
If one cloth gets dirty on every side begin using a new cloth.

, Don’t wipe back and forth or in a circle. This will push the dirt around, leaving a streak or swirl pattern on the paint.


Remember not to scrub, as you would with soap and water. The fluid should dislodge any dirt on the car on its own. All you have to do is pick up the fluid and dirt with a cloth.

, Continue this process until the whole car is clean, working top to bottom, clean to dirty.

, If you have a wax-based product it may require a second or third “buff” step. Read the directions on the bottle to see if this is necessary.

Set up a secure working environment.,
Remove the cigarette lighter and plug the memory keeper into the lighter socket.,
'].",How to Change a Car Battery2," Park on a flat, level surface at a safe distance from traffic, sparks or open flames. Put on the parking brake. Don't smoke, and make sure any smokers in proximity to the working area know not to smoke as well. Remember that electricity is not the only danger; batteries contain a sulfuric acid electrolyte solution, which is highly corrosive (i.e. can burn your skin) and produces a flammable hydrogen gas. Put on gloves and safety goggles., A Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) will keep the PIN codes and settings for radios and navigation systems from getting erased when you disconnect the battery. If you don't have a memory keeper make sure you have all the PINs for your electronic equipment before you start. You may wish to check your car manual to see what devices may be affected.

, After opening your hood, use the prop rod to keep your hood open (Most newer cars have hoods that hold themselves up.


Be aware that some cars have batteries locate elsewhere, like in the trunk, so you may not need to pop the hood at all.

"
Locate the battery.,
Identify battery terminals.,
Disconnect the negative terminal.,
Disconnect the positive terminal.

,
Remove the car battery.",How to Change a Car Battery3," The battery should be located in an accessible part on either side of the car's frame. The battery is a rectangular box with two cables attached to it. Some European cars (some BMW's) have the battery under the matting in the trunk, some vehicles can have the battery located under the rear seat, or some are located inside the fender of the wheel well (some Chrysler's). The latter is often very difficult to remove.

, Locate the positive and the negative terminals of the old car battery. The positive terminal will have a plus sign (and is often red) and the negative terminal will have a minus sign (and is often black).

, Loosen the negative cable clamp with a wrench (Usually 8mm or 10mm) and slide it off of the terminal. If the cables are unmarked, label them so that they don't get mixed up (otherwise you may ruin your car's electric system later on). It is also important that you disconnect the negative terminal socket before the positive terminal socket. Otherwise, you may short circuit the positive terminal to a grounded part of the car.

,, Unfasten the battery holder and remove any screws, clamps or bars holding the battery in place. Carefully lift the battery out of the car. Remember that a battery can weigh 30 to 60 pounds, or 13.5 to 27 kilos, so if you have any back problems, get a helping hand.

Remove the plastic bags that are protecting sensitive parts of your engine.,
Apply protectants to rubber and vinyl parts.,
Reattach the battery cables and reinsert the filters.",How to Wash Under the Hood of a Car," The only time you should wash under the hood is when the engine is cold. This means that you need to wait a substantial time after running the engine and washing under the hood. If you wash it when the engine is hot, you run the risk of damaging your engine as cold water may cause hot or warm parts to shatter or be damaged.


The best time to wash under the hood is in the morning after your engine has cooled all night.
Some experts suggest that it is okay to clean the engine while it is slightly warm. They note that this can help in the process of removing dirt and gunk. However, it is best to exercise caution and may be best to wait until the engine is cold.
Never wash under the hood immediately after you’ve been driving the car.;
, Before washing under the hood, you need to make sure that you cover or protect a number of parts that might be damaged by water. This is best done by securing vulnerable components with plastic bags and plastic tape.


Cover or protect the engine’s air intake.
Cover or protect the alternator.
Protect any electronics, electrical connections, relays, or sensors.
Cover or protect the distributor cap. It is easy for water to get under the cap. Make sure to cover it with plastic and secure the plastic with tape. If you get water under the cap, you can spray WD-40 to help dissipate the water. If this does not work, you may need to replace the cap and rotor.
If you have doubts about the damage water may do to a certain part of your engine, cover it., The next step is to take out any filters that could be damaged or ruined. This is important since filters are extremely vulnerable to water and are places where water could accumulate and potentially harm the engine or other parts.


The most likely filter you'll have to remove is the engine air intake filter. Rarely, if it is exposed in the engine compartment, you may need to remove the cabin air filter, too.
Make sure to cover any filter intakes with plastic, just as you did with sensitive electronics and other areas.
Store the filters in a dry and clean place.
Make sure you put the filters in a place you won’t forget them. It is imperative that all filters are replaced after you wash the engine compartment., Before continuing on to clean under the hood, you need to make sure you’ve removed the car’s battery cables. This is important since you’ll be introducing water into the engine compartment which could possibly produce a short in your vehicle.


Find an appropriate sized socket to loosen the nuts that fasten the cables to the battery.
Take off the negative cable.
Disconnect the positive cable.
Do not let the positive cables touch any metal part of your car. This could cause a short in your vehicle.
Place the cables on a table or in your garage where they won’t be exposed to water., Now that you’ve prepared your car, you need to gather the rest of the supplies you’ll need to proceed. It is important you have everything you’ll need, so you can wash under the hood quickly and effectively and make sure that all water is removed when you are finished. Make sure to have:


Car washing soap (non-wax or polymer).
Microfiber clothes.
Degreaser.
A hose and sprayer with a low-pressure setting.
Rubber or vinyl protectant for cars.

, Before you introduce water into your engine, you should spray a degreaser on non-sensitive metal parts in your engine compartment. The degreaser will help loosen grease when you go to spray down the engine.


Take your degreaser and spray it throughout the engine compartment.
Avoid sensitive areas with electronic connections.
Degreasing hoses and fluid containers is okay.
Do not spray the degreaser on areas where it might leak or drain into the engine itself.
Let the degreaser sit for several minutes., After you’ve let the degreaser sit, you should rinse down your engine with regular, low pressure water. Rinsing the water will help remove dirt, grime, and degreaser. This will help you avoid scratching sensitive plastics or metals later in the washing process.


Your rinse job should be low pressure and low volume.
Use a spray or spritz setting on your hose’s sprayer.
Do not flood the engine compartment with water. Go slow and go easy.
Pay special attention to areas you’ve degreased, and make sure to rinse out the degreaser., After you’ve degreased and rinsed, take a soap and water mixture and wipe down your engine compartment. Wiping down the engine compartment with soap and water will help remove remnant degreaser as well as dirt and grime.


Use a microfiber cloth.
Avoid soaps that include any wax or polymers.
Make sure you follow the directions on your soap’s bottle and dilute it properly.
Wipe gently and pay attention to areas with excess amounts of grime., After you’ve wiped down the engine compartment with soap and water, you’ll need to rinse it again. As with the previous rinsing, make sure to go slow and use low pressure. The goal is to remove soap and grime while making sure that water does not enter any sensitive areas.

, The next step will be to dry off your engine. Unlike with washing a car, you want to avoid air drying so that all water is removed from the engine compartment as quickly as possible. This will help ensure that water doesn’t get into sensitive areas.


Dry your engine compartment with microfiber towels.
Pay special attention to hard to reach areas and areas where water may accumulate and may not drain.
Wipe down the coil pack/distributor/alternator and other similar areas., After you’ve dried the majority of your engine, remove all plastic bags you used to protect sensitive parts of your engine. This will enable you to continue cleaning and proceed toward finishing the project.


Be diligent about removing all plastic and tape from the engine. If you leave anything, it could damage your engine.
Wipe down plastic bags before removing them, just to be safe., After you’ve dried your engine off, go through and apply your favorite (car approved) protectants to vinyl and rubber surfaces in the engine. This way, your engine will not only look clean, but will have a new appearance and will be protected.


Protectants will help prolong the life of rubber and vinyl parts in your engine bay.
Feel free to wax painted surfaces in the engine, but know that your wax will probably not last long because of the heat.
As with degreaser, soap, and water, avoid applying protectants to sensitive areas that you covered with plastic., Now that you’ve removed all plastic and dried the engine, and applied protectants, it will be time to reattach the battery cables, reinsert the filters, and otherwise return your engine bay to the condition it was in before you began to wash it. This way, your car will run just the way it did before, but the engine bay will be cleaner."

Clear out any debris.,
Vacuum the car interior.",How to Shampoo Car Interior1," Any wrappers, papers, stones, or other noticeable pieces of junk that have cluttered up your car interior until now must be cleared away before you can begin shampooing.;
, Vacuuming removes the majority of large dirt particles, making the process of shampooing both easier and more effective. Shampooing should be used primarily to get rid of greasy, smelly gunk that ordinary vacuuming or sweeping cannot remove.

Washing your car in direct sunlight also runs the risk of your car becoming hot while you wash it, which will result in water evaporating more quickly and making the cleaning process more difficult.Check that all windows are closed and retract the antenna, in order to prevent water from getting inside the car or the antenna from being snapped off.
Pull the windshield wipers away from the windshield until they click into their propped position, away from the glass.;
, This includes cleaning material: the car wash detergent that you will use for cleaning, a large supply of water (depending on the size of the vehicle), three buckets (two for washing, one for rinsing), a hose, and microfiber cloths or towels to dry your car.You’ll also want to have two or three wash mitts on hand, plus a large sponge, a stiff scrubbing brush, and maybe a separate brush to scrub your tires with.


Be prepared to get wet and soapy. Wear the appropriate work clothes: shoes, shorts and rubber sandals when the weather permits, long pants and rubber boots when it is a bit chilly.
You can purchase car-specific detergent at your local auto parts store. When filling the two wash buckets with detergent, be careful to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations concerning the suggested water-to-detergent ratio.

, Then add car wash soap in the quantity directed on its bottle. This will be your washing bucket. If your car is very dirty or if you’d like to have a washing bucket for the body of your car and a separate washing bucket for washing your car’s wheel wells, you can fill two buckets with water and soap., This will be your rinsing bucket. You only need one bucket for rinsing, whether you’ve chosen to use one or two buckets for washing., Don’t use a strong jet of water from the hose, as this can rub grit over the paint and scratch it. Try to aim the jet of water downwards on all surfaces.Aiming upwards around windows may cause water to dribble into the car if there are flaws in the rubber seals.

, Since the wheels of your car are often the dirtiest part, it’s a good idea to wash them first, so that dirt rinsed off of the wheels won’t land on an already-clean part of your car.Use a long, skinny wheel-brush for cleaning the openings of the wheels.


If the wheels are already glossy and clean, instead use a sponge or a mitt to clean them just as you would the car body after hosing off as much of the extra dirt.

, Before you begin scrubbing the surface of your car, soak a large wash mitt or sponge in the soapy water, being certain to wash out any dirt in it, and begin applying it to the car.Do not use a brush on the car body, because this may leave little scratches.


Mitts with long, dangling strands do not push grit onto the car as hard. This type of mitt is preferable, as it’s less likely to scratch the surface. They should still be rinsed, then dipped into the soapy water often.
Mitts, unlike sponges, can also be washed in washing machines to remove all the grit.

, Circle around the car several times, washing lower areas with each round.Washing the car from the top down will allow soap to drip over lower sections of the car while you’re still washing higher sections. This will prevent you from having to wash the same sections twice.


If the car is very dirty, let the soap and water do the work. Make multiple passes and avoid excessive scrubbing at dirt on the car, as this could scratch or damage the paint.

, Bird droppings and bugs can damage the paint, and extra care should be taken to remove them while washing the car. Get them off as soon as possible using a damp rag if you need more scrubbing power than the wash mitts can provide.Soften bugs by dabbing with a sponge that is loaded with warm water, then let the water soak in and scrub the bug off.


Use “bug and tar remover” where needed, as this will effectively and safely remove dried bugs from the surface of your car. Do not scrape hard or use a brush to remove the bugs, as that will mar the finish. Ultimately, a few stubborn bits of dirt will look better than scrapes.

, Rinse the dirt out of the wash mitt or sponge in the bucket with plain water frequently.If you allow dirt, grime, and grit to build up in the wash mitt, you’ll risk scraping or damaging the car’s paint. Rinse the mitt regularly in the rinsing bucket and, when the water in the bucket has become opaque or gritty, throw it out and re-fill with clean water.

, After one section is washed, rinse it with the hose before moving on.You don’t want the soap to dry on the paint and stain it. When rinsing sections, follow the same top-to-bottom pattern that you’ve used to wash the sections of your car.


Always wash the door shuts, surrounds (the metal visible inside of the door well), and the bottom underside of the doors. It’s an unpleasant surprise to open an otherwise sparkling clean car to find dirty door shuts.

, As you progress from one section to the next, it’s important that you use the hose to keep the entire car wet. This will prevent water droplets from drying on the paint and leaving water spots. You want to be able to dry the car with towels before it air dries.

, Scrub the lower body and the wheels last, as these are the dirtiest, grittiest parts.It’s a good idea to use a separate wash mitt or sponge on the bottom, as you’ll likely end up with a completely soiled wash mitt from this part of the car alone.

, If your tires are gritty or have absorbed dirt and grime from the roads you’ve driven on, you may not be able to successfully clean them using only a sponge or wash mitt.Use a plastic brush with stiff bristles to clean the dirt from your tire sidewalls.


Your local auto parts store will sell various brands of Tire and Wheel Cleaner, which will help you effectively scrub off dirt from the rubber tires.
If you choose to, you can use vinyl/rubber/plastic conditioner for dark-colored plastic parts and for tires. This should be available for purchase at your local auto parts store.

, At some point after you’ve washed the majority of your car’s surfaces, use the spray from your hose to rinse the bottom of the car, from various angles.


This is particularly important when the car has been exposed to salt, which can damage and corrode the underside of your vehicle.

, Don’t be afraid to use several towels while drying your vehicle—fully wipe down all surfaces that you’ve washed, in order to prevent rust from building up. Make sure not to leave any water standing on your vehicle once it’s dried, as this can tarnish the paint or cause rust.


Microfiber towels work the best for drying all car surfaces.When you’re finished using them, toss them in the washing machine. When laundering, don’t use fabric softener on microfiber towels. It can become trapped in the pores, then leach out, leaving a residue on the car surface.

, Wax (or similar polish) should be applied to a clean, dry car. You may need to wax the vehicle more than once: the failure of water to stand up in beads (or the presence of small pools of water on the car’s surface) after washing is a sign to re-wax.Abrasive polishes are rarely, if ever, needed with modern car paints and risk unexpected damage scouring through a clear coat.


Wax (or one of the newer polymer products) protects the paint from the sun so it doesn’t fade or deteriorate. It also protects the finish from the flying grit kicked up by the vehicles in front of yours on the highway. Polymer products last longer than wax. The ones purchased at auto supply stores are just as durable as the ones the car dealers sell you for hundreds of dollars.

, Remove rust from the car and touch up the paint if there is significant damage, or easily stabilize and seal small scrapes and rust spots with rust converter. Wash off any grit or corrosive pre-treatment chemicals, allow rust converter time to dry and cure, and do not wax a fresh paint finish.


Adhesive accessories such as door and bumper guards and reflective patches stick best to a clean, dry, not-too-waxy car. Stick things such as touch-up paint or stick-on accessories to car before waxing it.
A polymer wax-like product such as “Nu Finish” can be much easier to buff off than real wax, even if it is allowed to dry longer than necessary first.

, Apply RainX or similar water-repellent treatment to clean, dry glass to repel water from it and improve visibility. Reapply the repellent when water no longer forms small beads. Do this every few months on side and back windows as may be desired, every month or so on the windshield, where it is most needed and from which the wipers will tend to rub it off.


Glass cleaner can get the windows a little clearer than can just car wash soap and water, but drying them with microfiber towels after washing the car can make them sparkle just as much. Clean both the insides and outsides of the windows.
Use baby wipes to wipe the windshield free of any dirt.

Put on the appropriate safety gear.,
Determine what kind of battery you have.,
Get a car battery charger.,
Disconnect and remove the battery from your vehicle if necessary.,
Clean the battery terminals.",How to Charge a Car Battery1," Safety is paramount any time you are working on your vehicle. Start by putting on protective eye glasses to protect you from any falling material under the hood of the car, sparks or battery fluid in the event the battery becomes compromised. You may also want to wear gloves. Make sure the area you are working in is well ventilated and lit sufficiently to allow you to see where you are going and what you are working on.Gloves are not necessary but may protect your hands from small pinches and cuts while working on your vehicle.
Make sure there are no children in the area while you work on the battery of a vehicle as sparks could fly if positive and negative cables come into contact with one another.;
, In order to properly charge your battery, you must first identify the type of battery you have. You can usually find this written somewhere on the battery, but you may need to check the manufacturer's website if the label is too worn to read or missing. You should also find out the voltage of the battery by looking on the battery’s label or by checking in your vehicle owner's manual. Types of batteries include:Wet cell batteries may be serviceable, which means there are things you can do to help improve the charge and the life of your battery.
VRLA Batteries (Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Battery) are completely sealed and require no maintenance. These batteries come as Gel Cell or Absorbed Glass Mat batteries and are less common in cars unless purchased as an after-market modification.

, Pick a charger that is appropriate for your battery and purposes. Most chargers will work for all types of batteries except Gel Cell batteries. There are fast chargers that can charge your battery quickly or even provide you with a jump start, as well as ""trickle"" chargers that provide a slow but longer lasting charge. Many newer chargers come with a microprocessor to monitor how much the battery has charged. These digital chargers will then stop the process automatically when the battery is fully charged. Older, simpler chargers must be stopped manually to prevent dangerous overcharging and should not be left alone for extended periods of time while connected.Read the charger's instruction manual to make sure you are using your particular unit correctly.
Even new digital chargers should be monitored closely while charging to ensure it functions properly and stops before over-charging the battery.

, It’s important to disconnect the battery before conducting any repairs or maintenance on your vehicle. Most of the time you will be able to charge the battery without taking it out of the car, but if reaching the battery or fitting the charging cables in the engine bay or trunk where the battery is located proves difficult, remove the battery from the car completely while you charge it.If you are unsure where your battery is located, check the owner’s manual for your vehicle. Some vehicles have the battery in the trunk, while most have it under the hood.
Disconnect the negative terminal first, then the positive when removing a battery.

, Any dirt or grime on the battery terminals can prevent the charging cables from establishing a strong connection to the battery, so it’s important to clean the terminals thoroughly. Use baking soda and a wet cloth or a sandpaper pad to wipe away any grime or rust. Make sure the terminals are bare metal before moving on to the next step in order to ensure a strong charge.Sometimes you may find the battery has a solid charge, but dirty terminals were preventing the electricity from flowing.
Do not touch the terminals with your bare skin, especially if there is any white powder on them. This powder is usually dried sulfuric acid, and it can burn your skin if you come in contact with it.

Select the right materials.,
Work on one area of the carpet at a time.To avoid having to soak and re-soak the car's carpet, focus your attention on one area of the car before moving onto the next, rather than shampooing the entire car at once.,
Remove the floor mats.,
Pre-treat heavy stains on the carpet.,
Meanwhile, clean the removed floor mats.,
Spray the carpet with the shampoo.,
Soak up excess moisture as you work.",How to Shampoo Car Interior2," A general spray-on carpet shampoo will work well enough for the carpet in your car. You should also use a stiff bristle brush, like a stiff tire brush made with soft plastic.

, Oftentimes, people find it easiest to start with the driver's side floor before moving across the front of the car to the passenger's side, then circling around to the back.

, These must be cleaned separately from the rest of the car's carpet.

, Problematic stains like tar or oil may not be removed sufficiently by simple carpet shampoo. Use a cleaning product specifically geared toward treating these heavy stains to pre-treat the carpet before shampooing it. Follow the directions on the cleaner's label. Usually, you will need to spray or dab the stain lifter directly onto the stain, covering it completely. Allow it to soak for several minutes before washing.

, Spray an all-purpose cleaner or carpet shampoo on them, depending on whether or not there is any fabric on the mats. Scrub them with a stiff brush, rinse, and hang vertically to dry them out. Wait until they and your carpet are clean before putting the mats back in the car.

, Apply an even spray along each area of the carpet as you work. Work the compound into the carpet using your brush. You can use a little excess shampoo on areas with tougher stains, but avoid over-applying the shampoo. Car carpets tend to be moisture-resistant, but if soaked, they can develop mildew with relative ease.

, After scrubbing the shampoo into the carpet and allowing it ample time to sit according to label directions—usually only several minutes—scrub extra moisture out of the carpet by firmly pressing a clean, dry towel along the freshly treated carpet. Move the towel along the carpet in a single direction, rather than scrubbing back and forth. Continue until the majority of dampness is removed, and allow the carpet to air dry the rest of the way by leaving the windows or doors of the car open. Direct an electric fan toward the carpet if desired.

Mix special upholstery shampoo into a bucket of water.,
Focus on one area at a time.,
Scoop some of the foam up with your brush and work it in.,
Remove excess water with a dry terry-cloth towel.,
Allow the remainder to air dry.",How to Shampoo Car Interior3," You can use the same shampoo you used for the carpet, but one that is specifically designed for use with upholstery makes a better option. Use plenty of shampoo and mix vigorously to create a great deal of foam.The shampoo foam itself is what you will use to clean the upholstery instead of the soapy water. Upholstery, especially when made of seat cloth or velour, has a tendency to look dry even after being soaked. As such, it is very easy to over-apply cleaner if using soapy water or a spray-on shampoo.

, As you did with the car carpets, focus on cleaning one area of the upholstery at a time instead of applying the shampoo foam to the entire seating area at once. Begin on the same side you began cleaning the carpet from, and move in the same pattern.

, Lift the foam onto the bristles of your stiff bristle brush, getting as much foam as possible and as little actual water as possible. Transfer the foam onto the upholstery and firmly scrub it into the fabric using the brush. Use as little as possible to cover the upholstery.


The foam in your bucket will likely die down as you work, so you may need to re-agitate the soapy shampoo water periodically to create more foam. If necessary, you may even mix in additional shampoo.

, Press the towel into the upholstery firmly, moving it along in straight, single-direction lines to wring excess water out of the seats and into the towel.

, Most of the moisture will need to dry out naturally. Prevent mold or mildew from forming by leaving the windows rolled down or the car doors open, improving air circulation. You can even use an electric fan to speed the process along.

Place the charger on a stable surface.,
Connect the charger to the battery.,
Set the charger.,
Check the battery.",How to Charge a Car Battery2," Never place the battery charger directly onto the battery as it may connect the negative and positive terminals, causing damage to the battery and charger and possibly even starting a fire. Instead, place the charger on a stable surface as far from the battery as the cables will allow. Before plugging the charger into the wall, ensure the area is well ventilated by opening your garage door or windows if you are indoors.Ensure the surface you place the charger on is sturdy and stationary to prevent it from falling or disconnecting from the battery.
Use the full length of the cables to separate the battery from the charger as much as you can.

, Attach the black cable from the charger with the negative (-) sign on it to the negative terminal on the battery marked with the same symbol. Then attach the red cable with the positive (+) sign to the positive terminal on the battery with the corresponding symbol. Make sure to check the connections before plugging in or turning on the charger, as mixing the positive and negative terminals could result in damage to the battery or even a fire. Some cars may label the positive terminal with the letters POS instead of a positive (+) symbol and NEG instead of a negative (-) one.
Ensure the cables are firmly attached to allow electricity to flow from the charger to the battery.

, Digital chargers may indicate the existing voltage in the battery and allow you to set the final voltage level, while older models may simply allow for on and off settings. Speed chargers will also allow you to choose the speed in which you want to charge the battery (often depicted by a picture of a turtle for slow charges and a rabbit for fast ones). A fast charge is good for a car battery that recently died as a result of leaving your lights on or something to that effect, while a battery that has been dead for some time may require the slower charging method before the battery is usable again.If you can set the voltage the charger will stop on, set it to the specified voltage on the battery or that you found in the vehicle’s owner’s manual.
Never set the charger to fast charge if you will be leaving the vehicle unattended.
You may want to leave the battery slow charging overnight to fully charge it if it has been dead for some time.

, After allowing the battery to charge, check it to make sure it works. Some digital chargers will provide you with a readout that will tell you if the battery is properly holding the charge or if the battery will need to be replaced. This is often indicated by a percentage like “100%” as in the battery is 100% charged. You may also want to use a voltmeter to measure the voltage of the battery once disconnected from the charger by touching the positive and negative cables from the voltmeter to their respective terminals on the battery. If the battery is still in the car, the easiest way to check it might be to simply hook it up again and attempt to start the car.If the voltmeter reads the number of volts that are appropriate for the battery, the charger indicates it’s good, or the vehicle starts the battery is sufficiently charged.
If the voltmeter or charger indicate that the battery is bad or the vehicle won’t start, there may be other issues to resolve or the battery may need to be replaced.

Park a functioning car so that it faces the car you’re jumping.,
Use jumper cables to connect the two batteries.,
Start the functioning car.,
Disconnect the cables and allow the vehicle to run.",How to Charge a Car Battery3," Jump starting a vehicle involves using the electrical system of another running vehicle to charge the battery in yours sufficiently to allow it to start and charge itself. Before parking the functioning car, make sure you locate the battery in both vehicles, as some vehicle’s batteries can be found in the trunk. Once you have located the batteries in both vehicles, pull the running vehicle up to yours close enough so allow your jumper cables to connect both batteries.If the battery is in the trunk of one of the vehicles, back it up to the other so the cables can reach.
Set the parking brake on both vehicles to ensure they don’t move during the charging process.

, Remember that once you connect the jumper cables to a battery, touching the positive and negative ends of the other side of the cables will produce sparks that may be dangerous. With both cars shut off, connect the jumper cable to the positive terminal of the dead battery and then to the positive of the good battery. Be sure not to allow the negative cables to dangle into the engine bay where they may touch metal that could serve as a ground to complete the circuit. Next, connect the negative cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery, followed by the negative cable on the appropriate terminal of the good one.You may need to clean the terminals on both batteries to ensure a strong connection.
Be sure you connect the positive ends to the positive terminals and the negative cables to the negative terminals. Mixing these up could result in damage or a fire.

, With the cables securely connected, start the functioning vehicle so its electrical system can begin charging the dead battery. Do not take the functioning vehicle out of park or neutral during the charging process. Allow the vehicle to run for a few minutes before attempting to start the other vehicle.After a minute or two, attempt to start the dead car. If the battery only died recently, it should start right up.
If it doesn’t start after a minute or two, allow it to charge for a bit longer. If the battery has been dead for some time, it may take longer to charge it enough to start.

, Once the vehicle starts, you can disconnect the jumper cables from each vehicle. Allow the vehicle that had a dead battery to continue to run for a bit. You may have charged the battery enough to start the vehicle, but if you turn it off right away there may not be sufficient electricity to start it again. By letting it run, you give the vehicle’s alternator an opportunity to charge the battery the rest of the way.If the vehicle dies once again after it is disconnected from the other car, check to make sure the battery is securely connected.
If the vehicle runs well, take it out for a short drive to thoroughly charge the battery before turning it off again.

Have the battery checked by an auto-parts store.,
Test the alternator.,
Listen for clicking.,
Take note if the vehicle stalls.",How to Charge a Car Battery4," If you have charged the battery using a charger or another vehicle but your vehicle still won’t start, remove the battery (if you haven’t already) and take it to a local auto parts store. There, they can charge the battery and check to see if it works fine, can be serviced, or needs to be replaced. If your vehicle’s battery is a VRLA battery or a no-maintenance wet cell battery, you will have to replace it if it doesn’t hold a charge.If the battery is bad, you will need to purchase a replacement for it.
If the battery is fully charged and working well but your car won’t start, check the battery cables to ensure they aren’t broken and connect firmly to the battery.

, A faulty alternator can prevent your vehicle from sufficiently charging the battery enough to start the car again and can even fail to produce enough electricity to keep the vehicle running. You can check to see if you have an issue with the alternator by starting the vehicle, then disconnecting the positive terminal of the battery. A properly functioning alternator will produce enough electricity to keep the vehicle running without the battery, but if the vehicle shuts off, the alternator likely needs to be replaced.You can sometimes tell if there is an issue with your alternator by looking at your interior lights. If the lights get brighter as you press on the gas pedal, then dim again when you remove your foot, the alternator may be bad.
If you remove the alternator from your vehicle, many auto parts stores can test it to ensure it’s the problem before ordering a replacement.

, If the car won’t start, but produces audible clicking when you try, there likely isn’t enough electricity in the battery to start the vehicle. This may be because it failed to charge properly when you were charging it or it may be a result of the battery simply being too worn out to hold a charge. Try jump starting the car again, or remove the battery and have it tested.Make sure you have a good connection to the battery when charging it, otherwise the battery will not be able to start the car.
The clicking indicates that there is some electricity in the battery, but not enough to start the engine.

, If the vehicle starts after you charge the battery, but stalls soon after it starts to run, it may be because of the alternator. If it will start up again or it continues to crank but fails to start running however, the issue is not electrical. You may have an issue with fuel or air delivery.Your vehicle needs air, fuel and electricity to run properly.
You will likely need to take the car to a mechanic to identify the issue if this occurs.

, If a hose is not practical, such as in a campground or RV Park, use a bucket of water and the micro fiber mitt or micro fiber cloth. Apply water from the bottom of the vehicle up to avoid streaks.

, Wash your car first, and the wheels last; this will lessen the chance of picking up debris that will scratch your vehicle. Rinse your mitt or cloth often. If you don’t have a micro fiber mitt, use a regular micro fiber cloth. The bugs and specks of dirt will come loose from the finish with very little rubbing. If some spots don’t come free on the first go-around, come back to them after the entire quarter has been washed.

,, This will spread the water into a fine film that will not spot the finish. You can also hit any missed spots with the damp micro fiber cloth.

, You will completely polish and shine the finish, chrome and glass.

Remedy squeaking on-the-go with alcohol wipes.",How to Stop Windshield Wiper Blades from Squeaking1," Lift the wiper blade so it is oriented away from the windshield. Wet a piece of paper towel with a small amount of hot, soapy water or rubbing alcohol. Wipe the blades with the towel until the paper towel comes away clean.

Remember to clean the arm and hinged parts as well. Hinged parts of the wiper assembly can stiffen with dirt and grime, contributing to squeakiness.
For severely dirty wipers, you may need to use several pieces of paper towel. If your paper towel is somewhat flimsy, double it up before wiping or use a rag.
If your wiper blades don't stay in position when pulled away from the windshield, hold the blade away from the glass with your free hand and clean them one at a time.;
, Coat your windshield with a generous amount of ammonia-free glass cleaner. Now you’re ready to wipe the windshield clean with a soft, lint-free cloth, like one made from microfiber. Wipe with a top-to-bottom motion until the glass is clean.


Undiluted white vinegar can be substituted for glass cleaner. Add it to a spray bottle and use it as you would glass cleaner. Avoid getting vinegar on painted areas of your car.Ammonia based cleaners can damage tinting and cause plastic to degrade quickly. Ammonia-free glass cleaners should be clearly indicated on their label., Simply sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda on a water dampened paper towel for a stronger cleaning. Then wipe the glass clean in a top-to-bottom motion., If squeaking starts suddenly when you’re on the road, you won’t have the luxury of having household supplies on hand. Instead, keep some alcohol wipes in your car. When squeaking occurs, wipe the rubber of both blades with the alcohol wipe."

Remove friction increasing films.",How to Stop Windshield Wiper Blades from Squeaking2," Lots of wipers skip and squeak because the windshield isn't quite wet enough. Check your fluid level and top it off when necessary. This way, your sprayers are ready for action if squeaking occurs., Windshield wipers are designed to follow behind the motion of the wiper arm. If your blades are stiff and don’t trail behind the arm in a back-and-forth motion, twist the arm with your hands to loosen the stiffness.


Blades that are too tight won’t be able to alternate back and forth to trail behind the wiper arm smoothly, which causes chattering and squeaking.
Wiper blades should never appear to ""dig"" into the windshield or remain vertical as they sweep across the windshield., Stiff wiper blades can also cause chattering and squeaking. Some blades may be stiff fresh from the box, others may become stiffen through exposure to the elements. Blades that are a year old should be replaced; blades that are newer can be softened with:


ArmorAll. Apply a liberal amount of ArmorAll to a piece of paper towel. Using circular motions, work the ArmorAll into the rubber of the blade to soften it.Rubbing alcohol. Dampen a paper towel with rubbing alcohol. Gently buff the rubber of the blade with the rubbing alcohol dampened towel.
WD-40. Use this technique sparingly, as too much WD-40 can dry out rubber. Spray a little WD-40 on a paper towel, lightly apply it to the rubber of the blade, then wipe it dry., Check to see if your blades or the wiper assemblies under them are too loose or too tight. Too little or too much tension between the glass and wiper can create chattering or squeaking, too.


Generally, fasteners can be tightened with a wrench by turning them clockwise and loosened by turning them counterclockwise.You may need to experiment with the tightness to find what works best. Ideally, the blades should be held firmly in place, but should still be loose enough to sweep back-and-forth across the windshield.

, Common automotive surface protectants, like Rain-X or certain kinds of wax, can cause chatter or squeaking. Remove the product an eliminate obnoxious wiper noises with an application of normal car polish.


The film left behind by certain automotive surface products can increase the friction between the wiper blades and the windshield, creating unpleasant noises, like squeaking."

Install new rubber inserts.,
Replace your wiper blades regularly.,
Replace the wiper assembly.",How to Stop Windshield Wiper Blades from Squeaking3," If the non-rubber blade and arm parts are still in good condition, it goes without saying you won’t need to replace them. But sometimes the rubber breaks down faster than non-rubber parts (especially in sunny areas).Remove and replace the rubber blade inserts., Pull the metal arm away from the windshield. Where the blade attaches to the arm, you should see a joint. On this you’ll find a release for the arm. Open the release, take out the old blade, insert a new one, and reset the release.On some cars, there may be a push-tab or tension hook attaching the blades to the arm assembly. Release these kinds of fasteners with your hands and slide off the blade.
Depending on who you ask, you might hear that you should change your blades every six months or once a year, but it’s always a good idea to before the rainy season., Follow the wiper blade down the arm to its base. You should see a nut sticking up from this point. Remove the nut with a wrench. Now you can pull the arm off. Fit a replacement arm into place and fasten the nut and your new assembly is good to go.With time and use, the assemblies holding your wiper blades in place can become misshapen or inflexible, contributing to squeaking.

How often are customers using the services?


Take notes as you investigate the car washes. You can go back and review them as you make plans for your car wash.
Also pay attention to the other businesses around the car washes. If a car wash has a high volume of customers, what are some of the factors that are contributing to this? Is it located in a busy shopping center or right off the highway?

, A business plan will help you get financing to start your car wash and think through the details of your business. Make your plan as detailed as possible. The business plan should include an introduction (3-5 pages), market analysis (9-22 pages), company description (1-2 pages), organization and management (3-5 pages), marketing and sales strategies (4-6 pages), product/service (4-10 pages), equity investment and funding request (2-4 pages), financial information (12-25 pages).The introduction should include your Executive Summary, table of contents, and a cover page.

A bank loan requires a loan-to-value ratio of 75%. You will need to come up with 25% of the fair market value and the bank will fund the other 75%. It will be harder for you to secure bank financing if you have never owned a business before.
An SBA loan will either be a 7a or a 504. If you get a 7a loan, the SBA will partner with a local investor. Your actual loan will be financed by the local lender. A 504 loan is actually financed by the SBA and has job creation criteria.The start up costs for a car wash range from $100,000 - $400,000., Having the right location can make or break your business. A successful location should be near a shopping center, in a high traffic, residential area, be easily and visible accessible from the road, allow for expansions and business growth, and have enough space for cars to line up.Your sign is visible to drivers for at least 40 seconds. Ideally, traffic should travel past at no more than 40 miles per hour (64 km/hr) so drivers have time to see your signage and make that split-second decision to have their cars washed.
Choose a venue large enough to accommodate the bays, pump rooms, vacuum and drying areas, and the office.
Check your city's zoning regulations to be sure you are allowed to open a car wash at your chosen location. If you need a special permit, obtain it before you buy or lease your venue.
It is helpful to work with a real estate agent, city planner, lawyer, and/or an accountant to get the best deal on a location., You will definitely need a permit or a license to open your business. However, the requirements will differ depending on what state you live in. The SBA website maintains a list of business license offices to help you find the information.In addition to a business license, you will need a federal tax identification number and possibly a sales tax license, income tax withholding, and unemployment insurance tax.Ask your state business office about the insurance requirements for your car wash business.
Once you get all of the necessary permits and licenses, keep track of your renewal dates and make a copy for your business records. You will also need to display your license in your car wash so that customers can see it.

, The equipment you buy will depend on the type of car wash you have decided to open and the services you offer. Full service car wash, self-service car wash, and an automated car wash will all have different needs. You will typically need to buy a washing system (e.g. pressure washer, conveyor, self-service equipment, mobile wash systems), chemicals (e.g. cleaning solutions, wax, spot free rinses, protectants, presoaks, etc.), dryers, blowers, vacuums, brushes, towels, compressors, pumps, and a water system (e.g. boilers, water heater, water filtration, extractor, etc.), and billing system.


The International Carwash Association has a supplier guide to help you find reputable manufacturers.Look in trade magazines like Auto Laundry News and Modern Car Care to buy your chemicals. It is best to buy from big manufacturers.Popular equipment manufactures include Ryko, Hannah Industries, Belanger, Karcher, and WashTec.
Make sure the distributor of your equipment is available to service your equipment when needed. Find out how they handle equipment servicing before you buy from them.
Equipment typically lasts for 10 years.

, Use a multifaceted approach to advertise your business that includes flyers, posters, and an online presence. The signage for your car wash should be colorful with clear messaging. Make sure that people can easily see it from the road. A popular way to get new customers is by distributing coupons or discounts for car washes. Also, develop relationships with other small businesses located near your car wash.


Social media is an important aspect of marketing these days. Set up a website and establish a presence on Twitter and Facebook. Make sure any of the paper items that you have include links to your website and social media accounts.
Use your website to share information about taking care of your car and other relevant tips.
Schedule a visit to your local radio station to discuss your new business.
Consider starting a loyalty program. This will encourage repeat customers instead of people who use the coupon one time and never return.

, A car wash business is very customer-focused. Your employees should be punctual, efficient, skilled, and have excellent communication skills. As you conduct interviews, pay attention to body language and communication skills to get an idea of how the person will interact with customers and coworkers.Always check the references of potential employees as well., Wait at least 30 days before you have the big event.You want to work out some of the kinks and feel comfortable with the car wash before you make a big deal. Think of a grand opening as a party and social event to generate publicity.Invite friends, neighboring businesses, your supplies, and the media

, Many car washes have combined other services and businesses with their car wash to increase revenue. Additional services will make your car wash more attractive to customers and help your car wash stand out from the crowd. A convenience store restaurant, barber shop, or even an enhanced waiting area (e.g. television, free coffee, comfortable place to sit, etc.) are possible additions. Ask yourself some questions before you invest in an add on serviceDo I have enough space or will I need additional space?
How much will it cost?
What will be the return on my investment?
Will people buy this service?

, Express detailing services are services (e.g. wax, sealant, carpet shampoo) that can be done in 30 minutes or less and are done to maintain the appearance of your customer's vehicle. Because you already have the space and equipment, you can offer these services at a lower price than a free-standing detail shop. It is also more convenient for your customers to have their car washed and detailed at one location.It is important that you complete the detailing portion of your services is completed quickly. The speed and low cost of the service make it attractive to your customers.
Make sure that you advertise your detailing services to your customers.

, Text marketing is a low cost, effective way to market your business to your customers. Your customers will redeem mobile coupons at a much higher rate than printed coupons. Even if a customer does not use a coupon, you are still building your brand and making your business known.Choose a keyword (e.g. water, wash, clean) and advertise by saying, ""Text water to 12345 to get special discounts, specials, or coupons."" You could also say ""Text 12345 to get $3 off your next car wash.""
It only costs one or two pennies to send a text message.
Text your customers once a month with a special.

, Monthly and unlimited passes offer steady revenue even when customers are not actually coming in for a car wash. This is also a method you can use to build a steady customer base.Carefully price these passes. The price should be low enough so customers feel they are getting a good deal, and high enough for you to make a profit.Consider pricing your passes to cost of 2 or 3 times the price of a single wash. If you find that customers are not interested, you may need to adjust your price.
You can offer different price points based on the type of car washes you offer. For example, a monthly pass for basic car washes would be less expensive than a monthly pass for premium car washes.

, Give enough berth so that you can walk all the way around the car and still hold the spray wand. The wand is on a boom and will swivel with you where you go.

, If writing is obscured or sketchy, go check another bay because they will likely be all the same price. Machines usually take quarters. New ones take a charge card, too.

, You may need from $2.00 to $5.00 for an entire clean.

, There are 4 or 5 stages of a car wash:


Pre-soak (to get initial gunk off and start the soak and loosen the road film).
Wash (where suds come out).
Foam Brush (Using the scrub wand).
Rinse (to get the soap off).
Wax (which is a light coating to make your car shiny or at least to help it shed dust and dirt for next time).

, Car washes are timed for your dime. Take floor mats out of the car and set them against the wall to be sprayed as you walk around.

, Give it a second and the machine will start to run.

,, One circuit should do it. Remember to hit the floor mats as you go around.

, Grit, sand, and mud could be lurking in the brush from previous washes, and can scratch your finish.

, This is where it is good to have a rag or other cloth to wipe after the suds. Maybe have a friend to help scrub as you spray. Hit the floor mats with suds if you want, too.


If you usually take longer than one full cycle, let the time run out while you're on the foamy brush stage so you can get good scrubbing time in well after it actually stops dispensing the foam. This period also lets you see the spots you missed as the soap dissipates, and you won't be in a hurry, since the time has already run out. Just make sure to not let the foam sit long enough on the car to develop into a film. Pass over the car repeatedly to keep the surface moist while you scrub.

, If you go quickly, the suds will not have had time to dry a film. If there is some drying, just wipe it again and rinse, then do not touch that spot again with the rag. Don't forget the floor mats.

, Do not wax the floor mats.

This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better. You can also open your windows a bit to allow more outside air in (and it prevents your car from becoming too stifling)., If the fog is on the outside of your windshield (as it will be during the summer), you can remove it with your windshield wipers. Simply turn them on to their lowest setting and let them run until the fog is gone., This is a quick way to get the temperature inside your car to match the temperature outside. Roll down your windows as far as you can so that the warm air outside gets into the cool interior of your car.

Hold it over decal until you start to see the edges fray.You can also use a heat gun. These are used to dry glue and can be found at any home improvement store. They can burn hotter than a hairdryer and thus are better for large or particularly stubborn decals.;
, Most home improvement stores sell plastic blades that are specifically designed for removing decals and other flat objects that are sealed with adhesives. The plastic blades will minimize the risk of damage to the window.Slowly slide the blade under the edges and chip away at the adhesive to separate the decal from the window. Try to hold the blade parallel to window to minimize the risk of damaging the glass.
Look for the “Li’l Chizler” which is specifically designed for removing adhesives from glass.
You may be able to peel the decal off once you have the edge lifted. Older decals will be more likely to split into little bits and generally are more difficult to remove.

, Use a credit card or library card if you don’t have a plastic blade available. Chip away at the adhesive by holding it parallel and slowly sliding it under the decal.

, A razor blade is the best tool for removing the adhesive but is also the most likely to risk damaging the glass. Therefore, it should be a last resort is plastic scrappers don’t work. Be particularly careful to hold the blade parallel to the glass and chip at the residue with small strokes.If the blade becomes dull or doesn't seem as effective, switch to a new blade instead of turning it over.

, Whether you peel the decal off or scrape it off, it is likely to leave behind adhesive residue. Adhesive residue removers are spray-on chemicals that are designed to break down adhesive reside and can be found at any home improvement store. You can also use a citrus-based glass cleaner.After you have applied the chemicals to the residue, wait five minutes and then try to wipe away the adhesive with a paper towel.
Both options are non-toxic but you should still avoid direct contact with skin.

, If you are dealing with a particularly large decal or have difficulty removing spraying off the residue, you may want to invest in a stripe eliminator. This is a smooth rubber wheel that attaches to any power drill and can be used to remove adhesive. A stripe eliminator attachment can be found at any home improvement store for roughly $20., Remove any chemicals or remaining reside with a lint-free cloth. Dab the area gently to remove all liquids without leaving streaks.

Change your air source.,
Lower the temperature in your car.,
Turn on the defrost vent with cool air.",How to Remove Fog from a Car Windshield2," Most cars come equipped with buttons that allow you to recirculate the air already in your car or to pull air in from outside. If your windshield is fogging, change the setting so the air gets pulled into the car from the outside. Look for the button that has a little car with an arrow pointing inside the car. Tap this so the light above it is on. Alternatively, tap the button with a car and circular arrow inside of it so the light goes off. This turns off the function the recirculates the air already inside of your car.

, Because fog is caused by differing air temperatures, getting the air temperature inside your car to match the air outside will reduce fog. Turn your car fans on the highest setting, and turn the air temperature down as cold as you can stand.This is the fastest method but also the coldest, so be prepared to shiver a bit!

, The defrost vent will direct air straight at your windshield, but the cool air will help your windshield temperature match the air temperature outside. This can help get rid of the fog on your windshield."

Tie off the end with a piece of string, and then place one or two full socks near the front of your dashboard. This should absorb the moisture inside your car over night, preventing any fog buildup., Use the type of shaving cream that foams up when you squirt it out of the can or bottle. Spray a small amount of cream onto a soft cotton cloth and spread it over your entire windshield. Use a clean, dry rag to wipe it off. This should create a moisture barrier on your window, preventing fog build up., If your car is in a secure area, roll your windows down about a half inch or so. This allows some outside air to get in to the car, and can prevent the windshield from fogging.This method is best for the summer time, since you don’t want to risk any ice or snow getting into your car during the winter.

You should also clean the glass while working out of direct sunlight, while the windows are fairly dry. Otherwise, the sun may dry out the glass cleaner, leaving streaks behind.;
, A microfiber towel is also a necessity, since it has enough abrasiveness to gently scrub the surface of the glass without scratching it.

, You need to be able to have clear access to the top edge of the glass.

, Clean the glass by wiping the cleaner onto the window using your microfiber cloth, moving from side to side. Cover both sides of the glass.

, Remove any remaining wetness on your windows by drying them with the dry side of the cloth.

Apply a glass sealant.",How to Polish Car Glass2," There are many glass polishers available on the market. You can either select a glass polishing kit, which comes complete with specialized polishing discs that can remove more severe scratches or blemishes, or you can simply choose a high quality glass restorer that removes light spots and scratches., The polisher needs to have a speed setting between 1000 and 1200 RPM, and it must have a polishing pad.

,, Use as much as directed on the product label, or apply an even spread of polish across the entire pad.

, Hold the handle with your dominant hand and use your other hand to guide the polisher. Do not apply pressure, since the pad will apply enough pressure on its own to polish the glass.

, Move the machine from side to side at a gradual pace. Do not jerk the rotary polisher around, since doing so will increase the likelihood of accidentally damaging your glass. Keep going until the entire surface of the glass has been moistened with polish, and stop the machine once the polish begins to dry.


Be aware of the fact that the rotary polisher has a specific pattern of movement. When moved to the right, the machine also moves upward. When moved to the left, the machine also moves downward. Do not fight the rhythm of the machine. Instead, learn to work with it.

, Use a clean microfiber cloth to buff the residue away using even, gentle pressure and a small circular motion. Continue buffing until no streaks or residue remains.

, Your car glass is now completely stripped. A glass sealant helps the glass stay smooth and clear for a longer period of time by sealing the pores of the glass. Apply a small amount of sealant onto an automotive sponge and wipe the sponge across the glass, moving from side to side and up to down. Use as much sealant as necessary to seal the entire exterior surface of the glass.

These cleaners are more expensive but will generally give you better results. Standard glass cleaners such as Windex or a foaming glass cleaner such as ZEP will also work well. Finally, some people create their own cleaners by using a water and vinegar mixture or simply rubbing pure ammonia on their windshield.


Ammonia is an excellent glass cleaner. However, it can easily damage the paint, upholstery, and carpet in your car. Be careful of drips when using it as a cleaner.To make your own water-vinegar cleaner, mix one part hot water with one part vinegar in a spray bottle. Shake well.;
, First, mist a thin layer of the cleaner onto the windshield. If you can’t reach your entire windshield at once just clean half of it at a time. Using a new, clean microfiber towel, wipe the windshield clean in a horizontal back and forth motion. Gently lift the windshield wipers out from the car to clean the glass underneath them.If you’re using ammonia to clean your windows, pour a small amount of ammonia on the microfiber cloth before wiping the windshield. Remember to wear gloves when handling ammonia.
If you don’t have microfiber cloths, newspaper can be used instead.

, If you don’t have microfiber towels consider using a squeegee instead. Mist a thin layer of your cleaner on your windshield. Use the spongy side of the squeegee to scrub the dirt and grease off your windshield. Once the entire window is soapy, turn the squeegee over. Run the rubbery part of the squeegee across the glass in sections, pressing gently to remove all of the soapy liquid.When using a squeegee, you can skip the cleaner and fill a bucket with dish soap and warm water. Dip the squeegee in the bucket and clean the windows.
Keep a paper towel on hand to dry the rubber side of the squeegee in between strokes.

, Use a fresh, clean microfiber cloth. If you use a dirty or washed cloth you risk scratching the glass of your windshield. Dry the glass using smooth, circular motions. Press gently into the glass as you wipe to remove any stubborn dirt particles on the glass. Work in small sections but work quickly; if the cleaning fluid dries on its own it can leave fresh streaks.If you don’t have microfiber cloths, consider buffing the windshield dry with newspaper. The newsprint won’t leave lint marks and the ink polishes the windows to a shine.Don’t let the windshield dry on this own. This is how those pesky streaks are created in the first place.

, Move to the inside of the car and repeat the cleaning process on the inside of the car. First, lightly mist the glass with cleaner and gently clean the surface with a fresh microfiber towel. Next, dry the glass with a circular motion and inspect the surface for streaks. Repeat the process if necessary.


Keep all the doors open to ventilate your workspace, especially if you’re using ammonia. Breathing in chemical fumes can be harmful to your health.Don’t use a squeegee on the inside of your car.

, Windshield wipers alone can’t wipe away muddy debris from your windshield. This debris can dangerously limit your vision while you drive. Make sure you read your car manufacturers manual and know how to spray wiper fluid onto your windshield while driving.Most cars have a lever near the steering wheel that operates the windshield wipers. To spray windshield wiper fluid, simply pull the lever towards you.

Check your car periodically to make sure your wiper fluid is at the right level. Never substitute with water.

, If your windshield is clean but your wiper blades are dirty, you will still get streaks on your windshield. Gently pull your windshield wipers away from their resting position and towards the front of the car. Fill a small bucket with warm water and dish soap. Dip a clean wash cloth in the soapy water and wring it out until it’s damp. Next, use the cloth to clean the windshield wipers with smooth, gentle motions.


The windshield wipers should move from their resting position into their “cleaning” position easily. If you feel too much resistance when moving them, stop and refer to your car manual.
Don’t get soapy water on your clean windshield or you may undo all of your hard work!

, The rubber ridge on the edge of the wipers is the most important part of the windshield wiper. If this part of the windshield wiper isn’t dry and flexible it won’t connect with the windshield properly. Using a clean microfiber cloth, gently dry the rubber ridge of the wipers with a smooth pulling motion. Next, dampen a small section of a clean microfiber cloth with rubbing alcohol. Wipe the rubbing alcohol along the rubber ridge to speed drying and condition the rubber.Pinch the edge of the wipers with the cloth when drying them. This will help maintain the sharp edge of the rubber.
Wipe in the same direction when using a cloth on windshield wipers. Start from the part closest to the car and move out towards the edge.

, It can be easy to forget to do this, especially if you live in a dry climate. However, even sunlight can damage the delicate rubber ridge on your windshield wiper. A damaged rubber ridge will lead to streaking and limited visibility while you drive. Besides, it’s better to be safe than sorry!If you are handy with cars, you can replace them yourself. However, make sure you use the correct windshield wiper for your car.
Most people prefer to change their windshield wipers at the end of winter just before the spring rains start.

, There are a variety of water-repellant treatments such as Rain-X that can be used to help keep water and dirt off of your windshield. To apply a water-repellant windshield treatment, spray a fine mist of the fluid onto a clean, dry windshield. If the fluid doesn’t come in a spray bottle, apply a small amount to a clean microfiber cloth. Wipe it onto the windshield in small sections in a circular motion. Let the treatment dry for 5-10 minutes.Depending on the manufacturer, you may need to reapply the water-repellant treatment up to once a week.
If you see a filmy residue on your windshield after the treatment dries, buff the surface with a clean microfiber cloth using circular motions.

, Wiper fluid is sprayed from a nozzle just below your wipers onto your windshield. This fluid helps remove dirt and debris that you encounter on your windshield while driving. Ask your car mechanic what brand they recommend for your car. Be prepared to pay a little more than you’re used to for wiper fluid. However, it will be worth it in the long run!Don’t opt out of wiper fluid. It’s dangerous to drive without it. If you get mud on your windshield, your wipers won’t be able to remove it and your visibility will be dangerously limited.
If you run out of wiper fluid and don’t know how to refill it, ask your mechanic to do it for you.

, Regularly inspect your windshield wipers for issues such as corrosion and tearing. The rubber edge should be firmly attached to the blade and free of cracks or holes that can cause streaking. Gently tug the wiper blade to make sure it’s securely installed into the wiper arm. If you see any issues, talk to your mechanic about replacing your windshield wipers.

Listen for the washer fluid pump.,
Inspect the jets for external blockages.,
Use a pin to clear deeper blockages.,
Run a wire through the jet.",How to Clear Clogged Windshield Washers1," Before attempting to unclog the washer fluid jets, turn them on and listen for the low hum of the washer fluid pump. If the jets are clogged, you will hear the pump despite no fluid spraying.If you are unsure if the pump is on, ask a friend to listen from outside the vehicle near the hood.
If you do not hear the pump, the pump needs to be replaced.;
, Locate the jets on the top of your hood near the windshield and look for signs that something has blocked them. Often, automotive wax or polish can gunk up the outlet for the jets, preventing fluid from spraying properly.Wipe away any wax or polish that has clogged the end of the jet.

, If wiping away blockages does not clear the jets sufficiently to allow washer fluid to spray out, try using a pin or needle to clear the holes. Press a pin into the each hole on the jet, then remove it and wipe away any clogs that come out with it.Only press the pin in as far as you can safely remove it.
Do not press the needle too hard into the back of the jet, as you may break the needle or the jet.

, If a pin doesn't penetrate deep enough to clear the clog in the jet, disconnect the hose at the bottom of the jet from beneath the hood. Then run a thin wire through the bottom of the jet, up through the top nozzle. If the nozzle has multiple openings, you may want to run the wire through multiple times until you clear both holes.Guitar strings will work well for this because they offer the rigidity needed to pass up through the jet.
You can also use a stripped electrical wire.

Disconnect the hose from the bottom of the jet.,
Use pliers to remove the jet from the hood.,
Pull the jets out of the hood.,
Soak the jets in a bowl of vinegar.,
Install new washer fluid jets.",How to Clear Clogged Windshield Washers2," The rubber hose on the bottom of the jet is held on solely by the pressure the hose exerts on the nozzle, so you should be able to pull it off with relative ease.Simply squeeze the hose with your index finger and thumb near the nozzle and pull backward to remove it.
If the hose is stuck, use a pair of pliers to twist it back and forth to break it loose.

, Windshield washer jets are held in place by plastic stoppers. Take a pair of pliers and squeeze the stoppers into the jet, then press it upward.The jet will push straight up out of the hole in the hood with the stoppers pressed in.
If you are replacing the jets, it's okay to break the stoppers, otherwise be careful not to damage them.

, Lower the hood again and pull the jet directly up and out of the hole in the hood. With the clips already through, each jet should slide out of the hole with very little resistance.If the jet gets stuck, open the hood again and squeeze the clips with your pliers to release them again.
Be careful not to damage the paint on the hood as you pull the jets out.

, You may be able to clear any clogs in the jets by allowing them to soak in a bowl of vinegar for a while. Move the jets around in the vinegar a bit to ensure it penetrates into the blockage. After a few minutes, remove the jets from the vinegar and rinse them off.Once the jet is rinsed, you can try blowing through it to see if the blockage is clear.
If the jet is unclogged, reinstall it on the vehicle.

, Whether you purchased new washer fluid jets or are reinstalling the old ones you cleared, the process is the same. Insert the jet through the hole in the top of the hood with the outlets facing the windshield. Once pressed all the way through, the plastic clips will expand and hold each jet in place.Connect the windshield washer fluid line to the jet once its in place.
Start the vehicle and test your new jets to ensure they are working properly.

Visually inspect the lines from the reservoir.,
Clean clogged hoses with an air compressor.,
Replace damaged washer fluid hoses.",How to Clear Clogged Windshield Washers3," If your windshield washer jets are not spraying washer fluid onto the windshield, it may be due to a severed or kinked hose running from the windshield washer fluid reservoir to the jets. Look over the lines for signs of blockages or damage.Start at the reservoir and follow the lines all the way to the jets attached to the hood.
Look for signs of leaking, kinks or other forms of damage.

, If the hoses appear to be intact, the issue may be a clog inside the one of the lines. Pull the hose off of the nozzle at the jet as well as the nozzle at the reservoir, then use an air compressor or can of air to force air through the line and remove any blockages.If the air cannot pass through the line to unclog it, you will need to replace it.
If the air passes right through the line, reinstall it.

, If you are unable to clear a blockage in the hose, you will need to install a replacement. You may be able to purchase direct replacements at your local auto parts store, otherwise take the clogged hose with you and find a rubber hose with the same inside diameter. Purchase a length of hose that matches the one you need to replace.Simply attach the new hose to the same nozzles you removed the old one from.

This can lead to spots forming or an incomplete looking cleaning job. Many car washing pros recommend parking in a garage, but if this is not available to you, look for a suitable tree or overhang you can park beneath so you can work in the shade.


You shouldn’t settle for the shade provided by any tree. Some trees, like pines, exude a sticky sap that can do damage to the finish your vehicle if it comes in contact with it. Inspect trees before parking beneath them. If you notice the presence of sap, or if the ground beneath the tree is discolored, this could be indication that you shouldn’t park your car there.;
, Windows are one of the most visible parts on your car, and accidentally spraying, splattering, or spreading dirtiness while cleaning other parts of your vehicle could lead to your window, and your tinting, becoming unnecessarily dirty again. You’ll want to clean the exterior and interior of your car thoroughly before you tackle cleaning your windows and the tinting on your windows.


If you’re getting ready to sell your car, you may want to do a more thorough job cleaning your car. This kind of deep cleaning is often referred to as “detailing.” You can save money by detailing your car yourself, but you can also visit a local car detailer and have your vehicle cleaned by professionals for a small fee.
While cleaning the other parts of your car, take note of the condition of your windows and tinting. You may want to heavily apply your tint-safe cleaner to especially dirty areas before you start cleaning. This will allow the cleaner to pre-treat difficult spots, like bug spatter, layered dirt, or thick grime, making your future cleaning efforts easier.
Try not to get cleaners intended for other parts of your car on the inside of your window. The tinting that has been applied to your windows has most probably been attached to the inside, so if the ammonia based cleaner you’re using safely on the outside of the window spatters onto the tinting on the inside, the ammonia could cause damage to your tint., Knowing what products are bad for your tinting will help prevent you from accidentally doing damage to it or reducing its life. Tinting is almost always applied to the inside of your window, so that’s most likely where you’ll have to baby your tinting. Ammonia based products can reduce the darkness of your tint or cause its material to become dry, brittle, or otherwise imperfect. You should also avoid any drying or scrubbing products that are abrasive, including paper towels, newspapers, and scouring pads.


People often use a sharp edge, like a razor blade, to smooth out the bubbles or irregularities in protective covers that similar to your window tinting. However, this can cause lines and other imperfections in your tint. To chase bubbles to the edge of your tint, use a credit card wrapped in a soft cloth, like a microfiber cloth, or use a pin to puncture the hole and release the air trapped beneath the window tint., The material your window tint is made of, which in most instances is a kind of plastic called Mylar, is more prone to scratches and “chips,” which are places where the tinting is deformed by physical force. You’ll need to use gentler cleaning products on your tinting to preserve it, and under no circumstances should you use a cleaner with ammonia in it. Ammonia will fade your tinting and severely reduce its life. For this job you’ll need:


Ammonia-free cleaner
Bucket (optional)
Microfiber cloth (2)
Distilled water (optional), It's perfectly alright to use an ammonia based cleaner on the outside of your windows where there is no tinting, but even drips or spatter of ammonia based cleaner can harm your tint. An ammonia-free cleaner, on the other hand, can be used on both tinted and untinted sides of your window. At minimum, you'll have to use an ammonia-free cleaner on the tinted area of your car.


If you are using a liquid based cleaner, you’ll most likely need to prepare your cleaner in a bucket of water, though you should follow the directions that came with your cleaner for best results. Using only one of your two microfiber cloths, you should apply liquid cleaner and wipe away the dirtiness on your tinting.
Keep your two microfiber cloths separate. One cloth should be used for wiping away dirt and grime, and the other for drying. Once you have wiped your window clean with one cloth, you should use your clean, dry cloth to remove any remaining moisture on the surface of your tint.
Try not to saturate the edges of the tinting with your cleaner. If cleaner gets underneath your tinting, it could result in it losing stickiness and peeling away from the window. Dampen the microfiber cloth you have designated for cleaning with cleaner and then wipe it along the edges of the tinting to safely clean it. Then follow up with your drying cloth to prevent cleaner from seeping under the edge.
You may want to wipe the tinting with strokes that are opposite to what you used on the outside of the window. For example, if you’ve wiped the outside of the window clean in a vertical fashion, you should wipe the inside in a horizontal fashion. This will make it easier for you to see where missed spots are located.You may have to allow your cleaner to set on particularly difficult stains. Things like bug-spatter can be difficult to remove, but you can loosen the hold of difficult blemishes by soaking these for a few minutes in cleaner., There are many factors that could contribute to the dirtiness of your tinting. You might accumulate grime on it from driving long distances for work, or it could have built up over time from your off-roading adventures. Whatever the case, if your tinting is especially dirty, you’ll likely have to rinse the microfiber cloth you’re using for cleaning in a bucket to keep it from spreading around dirt. When you notice your cleaning cloth getting dirty, rinse it in the bucket to release dirt from the cloth into the water and wring out the cloth until it is damp. Then continue cleaning as normal.


If your home has hard water, you’ll want to use distilled water instead of facet water. Hard water leaves behind white colored scale and calcified spots on surfaces. Simple buy a gallon of distilled water from your local grocery store and put it into your bucket to use for rinsing your cloth., Bubbles beneath your tinting are unsightly and can ruin its seamless appearance. Using your fingers and nails to herd the bubble to the nearest edge is a useful tactic, but your nails can sometimes do visible damage to the tinting. To prevent these marks, you should use a credit card wrapped in a soft cloth, like a microfiber cloth, to chase bubbles to edges where the air can be released.


Bubbles under your tinting that are especially resistant to your efforts to herd toward an edge can be resolved with a needle. Use a fine-point needle to lance the bubble and release the air trapped under your tinting. This may create small ripples or wrinkles in the tinting from where the air stretched it. You should take a credit card wrapped in a soft cloth, like a microfiber cloth, and smooth these inconsistencies as best you can., Most ammonia-free cleaning agents make use of a gentle or mild soap, like baby soap, water, and a disinfecting agent, like alcohol. These are the three main components that will make up your ammonia-free, tint safe cleaner. You should also use distilled water when mixing your cleaner, as it has been filtered of impurities, like calcium and lime, that could leave spots, streaks, or other buildup on your tint. These products can most likely be bought from the home goods or cleaning supply section of your local grocery store. All in all, you’ll need:Baby soap (a generic brand is OK)
Distilled water
Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol (91% is preferred, but lower percentage is also OK)
Spray bottle, Take your empty spray bottle and rinse it to clean out any dust or residue from anything previously used in it. Then add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of rubbing alcohol to the spray bottle along with a few drops of your baby soap. Now you can fill up your spray bottle with distilled water, screw on the cap, and swirl the contents to ensure a thorough mix.


The alcohol in your cleaner, besides safely disinfecting the surface of your tint, will also help your cleaner to evaporate quickly and streak free. Alcohol also helps to dissolve grease and oils, like the kind that causes fingerprints, from the window.
These ingredients have a relatively long shelf life and can be used to make large quantities of your ammonia-free cleaner. By making your own cleaner, you can save a significant amount of money while achieving the same results as you would with a store bought brand., You may want to allow areas of your tinting that are particularly dirty to soak in the cleaner for a while. Just spray a heavy mist where the tinting looks dirtiest and allow it to sit for about five minutes. Be careful with your cleaner around the edges of your tinting. Allowing your cleaner to sit on the edge can lead to it seeping under the tinting, which could cause peeling, bubbling, or a shorter life for it.


You should use a two microfiber cloth system when cleaning your windows. The first cloth you use, the cleaning cloth, will be used to scrub away and wipe grime, dust, grease, oil, and so on, from the window. You may need to rinse this cloth at some point in a bucket if it becomes too dirty. Continuing to wipe with a dirty rag can lead to you just spreading the dirtiness on your tinting around. The second cloth will dry any remaining moisture on the tinting after it is clean.
You may have to allow your cleaner to soak into difficult stains. The protein of bug-splatter can make these especially difficult to remove. Spray a concentrated mist onto the difficult blemish until it looks thoroughly wet. Allow that to sit for about five minutes, then try to wipe the stain free. Repeat this process several times if the first attempt fails.Protect the already clean parts of your car from drips by applying your cleaner in small to moderate amounts. Dampen your cleaning cloth and firmly wipe your tint. This will decrease the formation of drips and drops. You can also hold your drying towel at the ready when using your dampened cleaning cloth. This way, if any droplets drizzle toward the already cleaned body of your car, you can wipe them away.

, Look at your car windows from inside and check for missed spots. Some will be difficult to see up close. Take a few steps back, change your viewing angle, and find any spots you’ve missed on the outside or inside of your windows. When you see a spot on the inside, take your ammonia-free cleaner a spritz some of it onto your cleaning cloth to damp it. Wipe the spot firmly with your cleaning cloth and then dry and buff the tint with your drying cloth. When all the spots are gone from your windows, your job is done."

Lift the windshield wipers up.,
Spray half the windshield with glass cleaner.,
Wipe the glass clean with straight vertical wipes.,
Wipe the glass clean with straight horizontal wipes.,
Repeat the process on the other side.,
Buff the windshield.",How to Clean a Glass Windshield1," Before spraying any glass cleaner, ensure that the area beneath them gets cleaned as well. Leave them in the “up” position for the duration of the cleaning process.;
, You could choose to spray either the left or right side first. Spray in such a way that you cover the broadest possible area of that portion of the windshield which you intend to wipe first. Two or three squirts of cleaner is usually enough. If your windshield is very large, use four or five squirts of glass cleaner, as needed.

, With your microfiber rag in hand, extend your arm to the upper center of the windshield and bring it straight down along the central vertical line of your windshield. Return your hand to the top of the windshield but slightly towards the side of the windshield you’re standing on. Wipe another vertical line down parallel to the first. Continue to wipe the windshield in this way, moving progressively closer to the side of the windshield you’re located on, until it has been completely wiped.


If you have a hard time leaning over the front of your vehicle to access the central areas of your windshield, use a step-stool to gain some height.

, When you’ve completed a vertically-oriented wipe-down, begin a horizontally-oriented wipe-down. Starting again at the upper center of the windshield, drag the microfiber towel straight out toward the edge of the windshield you’re standing on. Then, wipe another, parallel row toward the same edge, beginning just below the first row. Continue in this manner until the half of the windshield you chose to start on is completely cleaned.

, Once finished with one side of the windshield, repeat the process to clean the other half. For instance, if you began by wiping horizontal and vertical lines on the right side of the vehicle, move to the left side in order to complete the cleaning process. This ensures the entire windshield gets clean.


If you need to go over a certain spot more than once, wipe over it with a straight back-and-forth motion.Do not clean using circular motions as if you’re buffing the surface. This could leaves streaks behind.

, While the first wipe-down was intended to clean the glass cleaner off the windshield and remove excess grime, buffing the windshield involves moving your hand in a circular motion. Exchange the towel you used to wipe off the glass cleaner with a clean one.Depending on the size of your windshield, you might need several clean microfiber towels. Move your hand in a tight circular motion around the surface of the windshield. Start on one side of the vehicle, then move to the other side to ensure the entire surface of the windshield gets buffed.


Your windshield should sparkle like a fresh-cut diamond.

Wipe down side windows, from the top to bottom.,
Clean your wiper blades to finish.",How to Clean Car Windows1," When cleaning your car, you should always save your windows to last to prevent yourself from having to do more work. You can prevent contaminating your windows with smudges and grime by cleaning the rest of your car before you clean your windows., Car bodies absorb heat quickly, and sitting in the sun, your car might feel hot to the touch. If this is the case for your car, you'll need to park it in an area with shade and wait until the outside of your car feels cool.


If your car is too hot, it can cause cleaner or water that you use to evaporate too quickly for you to clean the window., Ammonia based window cleaner, like most household window cleaners, can be damaging to tinting and can dry out the rubber seals of your car.You should go to your local hardware or automotive store to purchase glass cleaner formulated for automotive purposes. If you buy the concentrated formula, you should dilute it with distilled water for best results. Including your cleaner you'll also need:


Automotive glass cleaner
Bucket (if using concentrated cleaner)
Cloth (microfiber recommended; clean cotton OK)
Distilled water (if diluting cleaner)
Sponge (optional)
Wiper treatment (optional)

, Due to size and angle, these windows can be the hardest on your car to clean well. Mix your cleaner, if necessary, and spray a good amount of it onto your window, or apply it from a bucket with a sponge. Then use your clean cloth to wipe your front windshield and rear window clean.


Clean in different directions to make it easier to see smudges or missed spots. For example, you might wipe up and down for the exterior of the car, and left to right for the interior., When your cleaning solution and cloth don't seem to be strong enough to eliminate the dried on protein of bug guts, you might need to take drastic measures. There are specially formulated products for removing difficult bug stains from the windows of your car, but you might be able to loosen the splotch by leaving a rag wet with cleaning product atop the bug blemish. Then simply wipe the splatter away with your microfiber cloth.


Some auto experts recommend sprinkling a little big of baking soda atop trouble areas that just won't wipe clean. Allow the solution a few moments to set on the stain, and try to buff it out with your microfiber cloth again., A common area that is missed when cleaning car windows is the very top, where the window usually slides into place inside a rubber seal. To prevent unsightly lines, roll your window down a little bit and use your cloth to wipe the area clean.If this portion of the window is especially dirty, you might need to spritz a little more cleaner onto the dirty portion of your window first.

, You may want to take your cloth and run it along the outside edges of the window first, to clean any buildup that has occurred along the seams of the window. After cleaning edges and corners, wet or re-wet the main surface of your side window and wipe it with opposite direction strokes from how you wipe on the inside.


For example, you might wipe your exterior widows dry with an up and down motion and the interior widows side to side. This will help you spot areas you've missed.
Cleaning your windows from the top down prevents drips from ruining your fresh-cleaned windows.
While cleaning your side windows you should also spray and wipe clean your side mirrors., Use a little bit of your cleaner to break up buildup on your windshield wipers and then wipe both wipers dry with your cloth. Buildup on your wiper blades can be harmful to your windshield and can cause your blades to wear out quickly if not maintained. To prevent this, you can apply a wiper treatment to your car after you have wiped clean the blades."

Continue scrubbing on the driver’s side.",How to Clean a Glass Windshield2," You could use the same towels you used to buff and clean the exterior of the windshield in order to avoid going through your towels too quickly.

, Starting in the upper-left corner of the passenger’s side, move the scrub pad down the windshield in parallel rows, working your way to the left (driver’s) side. You’ll have to stop after cleaning the first half of the windshield to apply glass cleaner to the driver’s side.


Remain in the passenger seat or lean into the car from the passenger’s side door to avoid bumping or leaning on the steering wheel while cleaning.

, Just as you did on the passenger’s side of the windshield, move the scrub pad from top to bottom until the entire surface of the interior windshield has been scrubbed clean. When you’re finished, use a dry microfiber towel to go over the entire surface of the windshield to ensure you didn’t leave any cleaning liquid behind. Move your hand around the entire surface of the windshield in a small, tight circle.

Look for a glass cleaner which is labelled “Safe for tinted windows” if you have tinted windows. These are readily available at auto stores.Plain water is a great windshield cleaner. However, it does not contain the same compounds as commercial glass cleaner, and is somewhat less effective. If you want to use water as a glass cleaner, you should definitely use it in conjunction with a microfiber towel to ensure your windshield is scrubbed clean.
Keep in mind that ammonia is very harmful to a variety of materials. Ammonia can also be hazardous to your health, so be wary of using it on the interior of you car.

, If you’re applying wax or polish, or repainting your vehicle, ensure you do it before you begin cleaning your windshield. Otherwise, you might end up getting a bit of polish or other undesirable substance on your windshield after it has already been cleaned. If you’re cleaning the windows on the interior of your car, do them before cleaning your windshield from the inside so as to avoid getting the cleaning agents on your clean windshield., Park your car beneath a shady tree or in your garage before beginning a windshield cleaning.

, Obtain a high-quality microfiber towel to clean your windshield. Ensure it has a weight of at least 300 GSM. These towels can hold up to eight times their weight in water and are gentle on the smooth finish of your windshield. Further, they prevent scratches by inducing electrostatic attraction in the particulate affixed to your windshield. The matter is thus lifted from, rather than dragged across, your windshield.Microfiber towels are readily available at your local auto care shop.

If you have trouble locating your wiper lever, consult your vehicle maintenance guide or contact the vehicle’s manufacturer.

, When you pull the windshield wiper straight back and away from the steering column, two parallel streams of windshield wiper fluid should eject onto the windshield.If your windshield wiper fluid does not come out when you pull the windshield wiper lever, or if it only comes out in a weak stream, check the level by opening your hood and locating the wiper fluid tank. Refill it if necessary.


If your windshield wipers do not work, bring your automobile to your local car repair shop and get them fitted with new wipers. You could also try to find the right windshield wipers yourself, but make sure to check your vehicle’s maintenance guide beforehand so you get the right length.

, When you think the windshield has received enough wiper fluid and has been scrubbed adequately by the windshield wipers, release the lever to stop the cleaning process. If your windshield wiper fluid leaves streaks or smears behind, consider refilling it with a different variety after exhausting the current supply. Alternately, you might consider investing in a new pair of wipers. Consult the staff at your local auto care shop for advice pertaining to your vehicle.


Windshield wiper blades should be changed regularly every 2 to 3 years.
If there is some buildup on the wiper blade itself, try wiping the blade down with rubbing alcohol or mineral spirits.

Even if there are no visible indentations, the fine particulate matter which has accumulated across the surface of your windshield can be removed with detailing clay. Obtain detailing clay at your local auto care shop.


Each detailing clay has specific directions for use. Carefully read the package and follow the directions.

, Next, apply an automotive lubricant to the windshield. This liquid combination will help the clay glide across the surface of the windshield. The amount of each you’ll need depends on the size of your vehicle. A bus will require a good deal more water and lubricant that a small car.

, Grip it in the manner you would a bar of soap. Keep your middle and index fingers on top of the clay, your thumb on one side and your remaining fingers on the opposite side. Move the detailing clay through the lubricant/water you’ve applied to the windshield. The clay should glide back and forth smoothly across the wet glass., Reach over the windshield and place the clay in the center. The clay should be placed in the center bottom of the windshield where it meets the hood.

, Bring the detailing clay from the base of the windshield to the top where it meets the roof. When you’ve completed one vertical line, place the clay at the bottom of the windshield again, but in a location slightly closer to you. Draw a second vertical line up from the windshield to the roof of the vehicle. The second line should be parallel to the first. Continue to drag the clay across the surface of the windshield in straight, vertical lines, moving the rows gradually closer to you.

, When you feel the clay slow or stick in its motion across the windshield, you’ll know it has encountered some grit or grime on the windshield., Move the clay up in a straight vertical line toward the roof of the vehicle. After completing a vertical line, bring the clay back down to the base of the windshield. Position it at a point slightly closer to you, but directly next to the location you originally moved the clay from. Continue moving the clay up the length of the windshield in straight vertical lines, gradually bringing the clay closer to you.

, This will remove any excess clay which may still be attached. You can choose to use either the same hand or a different hand on the two different halves of the windshield.

If there is visible dirt, to minimize the amount of work, wash the windshield as you would the entire car.  You can go to a car wash or just simply rinse the area off with a garden hose.  The goal is to remove the worst of the stuck on debris.;
,  If the hood is flat enough you can place them there.

,


If you can lift the arm up all the way and it stays- great!
If you can flip the wiper over so the blade is facing upward- good!
If you can just get your hand under the wiper-okay!
If you cannot do either than you may have to improvise or remove the wiper.

,  For this example the best on this car was to flip over the blade and allowing it to rest against the windshield.  The hand towel was used to prevent damage to the windshield.

,  You may want to double it up in order to add strength and have enough cleaner.

,,  Discard the paper towel and repeat the cleaning process until this is achieved.

,  If any blemishes are found (cuts or chunks missing) then stop and replace the wiper blade.

,


Yes: Congratulations, you are done!
No: Repeat the cleaning process.
No again: Clean the windshield and repeat the wiper cleaning process.
No again, again. Something else beyond normal cleaning is going on here.  For example you could have a stone chip in your windshield or wiper blade failure that requires replacement.

Heat water to a cool-lukewarm temperature.,
Pour the water on the window(s).,
Follow up with quick scraping or wiping.",How to Clean Frost Off Car Windows Quickly1," This method uses water to rapidly soften and melt the ice on your windows. The larger the area of glass that you'd like to melt, the more water you'll need. For instance, if you just want to melt the ice on the front window of a four door sedan, you'll only need a few cups, whereas if you want to melt the ice on all six windows, you'll need a gallon or more. Your water shouldn't be boiling hot - in fact, the rapid temperature change brought by very hot water can cause the glass to crack.


If you take a morning shower, use the opportunity to fill a bucket or jug with lukewarm water. This way, you save time because you only need to wait for the water to heat up once.
Another reason not to use hot water is that, in extremely cold environments, hot water can actually spontaneously freeze into powder when thrown through the air.;
, Splash, throw, or pour your water on the windows you want to defrost. You should notice the ice become immediately translucent. You may even notice it disappear completely.

, Though water will quickly soften or melt most ice, in some cases, the ice remains on the windshield in a translucent, ""slushy"" form. Fortunately, this softened ice is usually very easy to remove. Use your windshield wipers, a gloved hand, a conventional scraper, or another similar tool to push the ice out of the way.


Re-apply warm water to any spots you missed, then re-wipe.

Cut a raw potato in half.,
Rub the cut side of one half potato on the window.,
Use the other half of the potato if needed.,
Leave to dry without touching.",How to Keep Car Windows Fog Free Using a Potato," Be sure to use a clean potato, so wash it first if it is coated in soil. This is a good opportunity to use up an old potato that has started to sprout and is past its best.


You can also use up the potatoes going green.;
, Wipe from side to side to cover all of the window. This will clean it and leave a layer that will prevent condensation from forming on the window.


If you notice starch streaks forming, wipe them off. You may need to wipe more quickly to avoid leaving any streaks.
You can also cut off dirtied slices or parts of the potato half and continue with the clean part.

, If you're doing all of the windows, you'll probably need to use up both potato halves.

, The potato juice should dry clear and the windows will remain fog-free, as the starch in the potato acts as a barrier between the glass and the air.


While the potato film is drying, don't touch it or you'll leave fingerprints dirtying the window.
Throw the used potato into the compost.

Buy a commercial de-icer or make your own.,
Spray your de-icer on the window.,
Scrape as normal.",How to Clean Frost Off Car Windows Quickly2," Specially-formulated de-icing fluid is available at most auto shops, especially if you live in an area with cold winters. However, if you don't have any de-icer on hand or you just want to save money, it's not hard to make your own. Follow the simple instructions below:To make your own de-icer, pour rubbing alcohol into a clean, dry spray bottle. Add a few drops of dish soap. Screw the lid on, then invert several times to mix.

, Whether you bought de-icer or made your own, you'll use it the same way. Spray your de-icer directly on to the icy parts of your window, then allow it to soak in briefly. You shouldn't need to wait more than a minute or two - the more de-icer you use, the less time you'll have to wait.

, Use a plastic scraper, a gloved hand, or another tool to scrape the ice away. You should find that it comes off of your window much quicker and easier than it normally would, saving you time overall. If needed, re-apply your de-icer to difficult spots as you scrape.


In commercial concentrations, rubbing alcohol has a very low freezing point, so it's usually OK to leave your de-icer in the car unless you're expecting temperatures of -20 F (-29 C) or lower.

Turn your car's defroster on.,
Find an appropriate credit card.,
Start scraping.,
Use your wipers and fluid to assist.",How to Clean Frost Off Car Windows Quickly3," This last-resort method is appropriate when you don't have a lukewarm water, de-icing fluid, or any conventional scraping tools at your disposal - for instance, if your car's window froze in the parking lot while you were at work. Because you're going to attempt to remove the ice with a credit card or other improvised tool, it's wise to give yourself as much help as possible. To begin, start your car and turn on your heater/defroster as high as it goes. Leave this running throughout the process - over time, it will soften and begin to melt the ice, making your job much easier.

, Dig through your wallet to find a credit card or any similar stiff, solid plastic card. Don't use a laminated card - these aren't stiff or sturdy enough to scrape the ice effectively. If possible, try to use a card that isn't important to you, like an old, expired credit card, as this method carries the risk of damage to your card.

, Hold the long edge of your card at an angle against the window and push firmly. Try to keep the card as straight as possible, not allowing it to bend or flex as you scrape. If you do, you may end up deforming or breaking it.


Be persistent! As far as scrapers go, credit cards can require more effort than dedicated scrapers. You may need to push quite hard to get results.
If you're worried about breaking your card, you may want to double or triple the strength of your scraper by holding two or three cards stacked as you scrape.

, As you scrape ice away, you'll probably accumulate ice shavings at the edges of the window. Periodically, spray wiper fluid and run the wipers for a few seconds. The wiper fluid can help soften up any remaining ice, while the wipers themselves will help brush the ice shavings out of the way. Between the scraping action of your credit card, your wipers and fluid, and your defroster, your window should be free of ice within a few minutes.

Place rice in a mitten or heavy duty zip-lock bag and microwave for 30 seconds to a minute.,
While seated inside your car, pass the rice packet back and forth over the window.,
Be careful and quick.",How to Clean Frost Off Car Windows Quickly4," You may need to make several of these to complete the job., This will warm the glass and the ice will melt.

Sodium acetate hand-warmers also can be used in this manner and can stay ready in the car. A quick click to activate the heat reaction and then you can recharge the warmers by boiling in water.
The advantage of this method over scraping, is because the glass is warmed as you start to drive it will not re-frost. Also you stay warm and dry inside the car while prepping for departure.

, Just like boiling water may crack glass, holding a hot warmer in one place too long may stress the glass. Only allow it to remain in place long enough to start to show melting, as it will continue to melt while moving on to a new area. Windshield wipers and rolling down the side windows can be used to clear moisture."

Cover your windows at night.,
In the morning, remove the window covers.,
Spot-scrape any icy spots.",How to Clean Frost Off Car Windows Quickly5," One sure-fire way to ensure you're not delayed by icy windows in the morning is to keep ice from forming in the first place. To do so, cover your windows with a towel, a folded sheet, or a piece of cardboard at night before dew or ice forms on the window. Try to arrange the cover tight against the window so that dew (and eventually, ice) can't form in any loose spots.


One useful trick for your front windshield is to use your car's windshield wipers to hold your cover in place. For your other windows, you may want to use small rocks or other weights to pin your cover down.

, Pull your towels, sheets, etc. away from the window. They may be damp and/or icy, so, if you plan to use your window covers again at your destination, be sure to lay down a water-tight barrier, like a tarp, before throwing them in your trunk.

, Though this method should greatly reduce the amount of ice on your windows, there may be a few small patches remaining. Use a plastic scraper, your hand, or a similar tool to remove these if they obscure your vision. If you're in a hurry, you may want to get in your car and use your windshield wipers in conjunction with the defroster and your wiper fluid.

Pick up any solid matter.,
Blot the vomit to remove excess moisture.,
Sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the area you're cleaning.,
Create a liquid cleaning solution.,
Scrub the stain.,
Rinse the area with clean water.,
Blot the area dry with more lint-free cloths.,
Open all of your car doors or windows to allow the area to completely dry.",How to Remove Vomit From a Car Interior1," You can use a spatula and scrape the surface to remove chunks, or use a cloth or thick paper towel to remove pieces.;
, Press on an absorbent cloth or paper towel just hard enough to absorb liquid, but not so hard that you force the vomit further into the underlying surface.

, This will help absorb the odor of the vomit. Leave the baking soda for about 30 minutes, then vacuum it.

, Be sure to create a solution that will work on the type of material you need to clean, whether it is leather, upholstery, plastic, or carpeting. While you can purchase a commercial cleaner made for the appropriate material, you can also make your own:


For leather upholstery: Make a paste of baking soda and water by mixing three parts baking soda to one part warm water.
For vinyl, cloth, plastic, or carpeting: Mix eight parts warm water with one part white vinegar. Add about a half teaspoon (5 mL) dishwashing liquid and stir thoroughly.

, Apply the liquid cleaning solution to the vomit stain, using a lint-free cloth to thoroughly scrub the area. If the stain has penetrated your car's carpeting, you may need to use a hard-bristle brush., Use a wet or damp lint-free cloth to remove as much of the cleaning solution as possible.


Use a damp, not wet, cloth to clean leather upholstery.
Rinse vinyl or cloth upholstery, plastic or carpeting with a wet cloth. If you've used a great deal of cleaning solution, you may find it more efficient to use a squirt bottle for rinsing.

, If you have them, use white cotton cloths so that you can see that the stain is being lifted every time you blot. Continue blotting until no stain is visible on the upholstery or on your blotting cloth.

, Depending on the weather and your car's location, you may wish to set up a fan or use a hair dryer to speed the drying process."

Scrub or wipe off any dried pieces or crusts.,
Moisten the area with a liquid cleaning solution.,
Let the solution sit on the stain.,
Use a brush to scrub the solution into the stain.,
Blot with water until the solution is removed.,
Rent a steam cleaner for stubborn stains.",How to Remove Vomit From a Car Interior2," Depending on the surface you're working on, you can use a stiff bristled or soft bristled brush. An old toothbrush will work in a pinch.


Loosen any dried crust from the upholstery and brush it off using a small brush or vacuum cleaner.

, You can use any solution that is safe for the surface you are cleaning. A commercial carpet cleaner, leather cleaner, or upholstery cleaner will work; you can even use a laundry stain remover for surfaces like cloth or carpet. You can make your own solution.


If you are cleaning leather upholstery, make a paste by mixing 3 parts baking soda to one part warm (but not hot) water.
If you are cleaning vinyl, cloth, plastic, or carpeting, mix together eight parts warm (but not hot) water with one part white vinegar. Add a half teaspoon (5 mL) dishwashing liquid and mix well.

, For set-in stains, you should let the solution sit until it dries, then re-wet the stain with the solution a second time and let it sit for a few more minutes before scrubbing.


This ensures that the solution penetrates through the stain so that when you scrub it you can remove all of the dried vomit.

, To penetrate the dried stain, use the hardest brush you can safely use on the material with the stain.Some surfaces like vinyl or leather will be scratched by a hard bristled brush, so you'll need to use a sponge or soft-bristled brush. For surfaces like carpeting or cloth upholstery, use the firmest brush that will not damage the surface.

, You don't want to saturate the surface of your car seat or carpet, but you need to use enough water to remove the cleaning solution.


Try dipping a wash rag in clean water, blotting it on the solution, then wringing it out. Repeat this process until you've soaked up all the cleaning solution, and the stain should come up with it.

, If all else fails, you may need to resort to professional-grade steam cleaning. You can rent a carpet cleaner from a big box home store, and these can be used for carpet or cloth upholstery in your car.


Don't use a steam cleaner for stains on leather, plastic, or vinyl.

Open up the car doors and windows.,
Try to clean up the vomit as soon as possible.,
Try using baking soda and essential oils to get rid of the smell.,
Try a car air freshener if all else fails.",How to Remove Vomit From a Car Interior3," Any nasty smell will dissipate dramatically if it has the chance to air out. Before, during, and after cleaning out the vomit, be sure to let your car air out a bit with the doors open. Air out the car in your driveway or a parking lot, but not in your garage. There's not enough air circulation in a garage for this to be effective.

, The longer you let the vomit sit in the car, the more the fluid will soak into your upholstery.


In hot months, the vomit might actually putrefy and create an even more rotten smell if you just let it sit there., Baking soda is a classic stand-by for eliminating all kinds of nasty smells; it actually absorbs the smells and eliminates it.You can use baking soda with a bit of essential oil mixed in to eliminate the smell of vomit from your car.


Mix a few tablespoons of baking soda together with a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Any nice-smelling oil will do, but lemon or orange is especially good at eliminating smells. You can simply shake the baking soda and oil together in a plastic container with a lid.
After cleaning up the vomit, moisten the spot and sprinkle the baking soda and essential oil mixture on top. Cover the surface of the area that had vomit on it, and let it sit for ten minutes. Then, use a vacuum with a hose attachment to vacuum up the baking soda.

, If the smell is still in your car, you might try masking it with a commercial car air freshener.


You can try the type that hangs from your rearview mirror, the gel that sticks to your console, or a powder that you sprinkle on and vacuum up. Any of these can leave your car smelling nice and fresh.

Add one gallon of distilled water to a clean, empty container.,
Add one cup of glass cleaner.,
Mix well by shaking the container and add the solution to your car.",How to Make Windshield Washer Fluid1," Pick a container that is easy to pour and holds at least one and a quarter gallons. Always use distilled water to prevent mineral deposits from building up in your car's spray nozzles and pump.


Tap water can be used in an emergency. Just remember to replace the fluid as soon as possible to keep from damaging your car.;
, Pick the commercial glass cleaner of your choice. Make sure to choose a cleaner that produces minimal (preferably no) suds or streaks. This method is good for everyday use, especially during the summer.

, If this is your first time making it, test it on your car first. Dab a little solution onto a rag and wipe a corner of the windshield. The ideal cleaner should wipe away dirt without leaving any residue.

Add one gallon of distilled water to a clean jug.,
Measure one tablespoon of dish soap and add it to the water.,
Add 1/2 cup ammonia.,
Recap the container and shake to mix well.",How to Make Windshield Washer Fluid2," Use a funnel if you have difficulty adding the water. The jug should be easy to pour and capable of holding a little over a gallon. Be sure to save the container's cap for easy mixing and storage.

, Don't use too much soap, or your washing fluid may be too thick. Use whatever kind you have on hand. Make sure the soap doesn't leave behind streaks or residue on glass. If it foams too much, try a different soap. This method is best if you anticipate needing to drive through muddy terrain., Use a non-sudsing ammonia that is free from additives and surfactants. Be very careful with this step, as concentrated ammonia can be dangerous. Work in a well-ventilated area and wear gloves.Once the ammonia is well-diluted by the water, it becomes relatively safe for use as a cleaner. , Test your cleaner before using it for the first time. Dab a little onto a clean rag and wipe a corner of your windshield. If your cleaner removes grime without leaving a residue, it's ready to put in your car.

Add one cup isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to any of the first three methods if temperatures drop below freezing.,
Leave a small container of your solution outside overnight.,
Mix thoroughly by shaking the container.",How to Make Windshield Washer Fluid3," If your winters are mild, use 70% rubbing alcohol. If you experience extreme cold weather, use 99% instead.


In a pinch, you can use high proof vodka instead of isopropyl alcohol., If the fluid freezes, you will need to add at least another cup of alcohol. Test your solution again. This step is very important to prevent the fluid from freezing and rupturing your car's washer fluid hose.

, Drain any warm weather washing fluid before adding the cold weather cleaner. If there is enough warm weather fluid left, it may dilute the alcohol in the cold weather cleaner. If the alcohol is diluted enough, the solution will freeze.

Pour 12 cups (3/4 gallon) distilled water into a clean, empty jug.,
Add 4 cups white vinegar.,
Mix the solution thoroughly by shaking the container.",How to Make Windshield Washer Fluid4," Make sure the container's capacity is a little more than a gallon. If the rim of the container is narrow, use a funnel to make pouring easier. Label your container with a permanent marker.

, Use white vinegar only. Other types of vinegar may leave behind residue or stain your clothing. This is the best type of cleaner for removing pollen.


Do not use this method in warmer weather. Hot vinegar creates a foul, pungent odor.

, If the temperatures in your area dip below freezing, do a freeze check before adding the cleaner to your car. Leave a small cup of the solution outside overnight and check in the morning. If it has frozen, add another two cups of vinegar to the jug and try again. If it still freezes, add one cup of rubbing alcohol and check again.

Start your car and let it idle warm the car up.,
Spray your car with a saltwater solution.,
Apply an alcohol and water solution to melt the ice.,
Buy a commercial de-icer if the homemade solutions fail.,
Use a squeegee, soft-bristled brush, or your windshield wipers to scrub away the residue.,
Keep an ice scraper in the car all winter to chip ice off your windshield.",How to De‐ice Your Windshield1," If your car has a ""defrost"" setting on the temperature gauge, put it on. Wait at least 15 minutes for the glass to warm up.


Never attempt to try to defrost the windshield using water, hot, cold, or warm. Using warm or hot water can cause the glass to break due to thermal shock due to temperature change. In very cold climates, cold water can also freeze on the windshield, making your troubles even worse.
While your car is warming up, make sure no ice, snow, or other materials are blocking the vehicle tailpipe. Remove any blockage to prevent the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning.
If you drive in a very snowy area, wait until the ice has noticeably begun to melt before proceeding to the next step. It may take thicker ice well over 15 minutes to sufficiently begin melting.;
, This will dissolve the ice via chemical reaction rather than melting it with heat. The ions in salt also lower the freezing point of water, making it difficult for water to refreeze. Apply the saltwater sparingly to your windshield since heavy salt exposure may cause damage to the glass.While normal table salt will suffice in above freezing temperatures, you may want to consider using road salt, which is commonly shoveled onto residential sidewalks to quickly melt ice and reduce hazards. Road salt has a different chemical composition that makes it more effective at freezing temperatures.

, Make a 2:1 rubbing alcohol to water solution and fill a spray bottle with it. Spray the solution onto all desired windows.


You can also add a few drops of dish soap to the solution.Adding chemicals is similar to adding salt and lowers the freezing point of water. This will melt the ice more quickly than warm water.
Unlike the saltwater solution, the alcohol solution can be sprayed liberally without risking damage to your car.

, Most commercial formulas work well but tend to be costly. Like scrapers, these formulas shouldn't be hard to find at your local car supply store. Almost every auto store has a section dedicated to de-icers.


Examples of popular de-icing agents include ""Valvoline Deicer"" and ""Prestone Spray-on Windshield De-icer."", Once you have applied your chosen solution, wipe away the liquid and ice from your windshield and car.


After a minute or two, your saltwater or alcohol solution should begin to melt the ice. Keep in mind, however, that the ice will only be partly melted. It will need to be brushed away in order to improve visibility., You should purchase one for your car well in advance, then leave it in the trunk to handle ice if you have no other supplies around. Push it into the windshield and use short, powerful strokes to chip the ice away.Ice scrapers are specialized tools for scraping ice from your windshield. Typically, they are plastic, and have a large, flat, dull blade on one end, and a handle on the other, sometimes combined with a brush. They can be purchased up at most auto stores and car supply stores. In cold climates, these will also be available in most large retail stores, hardware stores, gas stations, even grocery stores.
In a pinch you can use a standard squeegee to scrape ice, although this is not as effective. Scraper heads are made from plastic rather than rubber, and this makes them more sturdy when scrubbing away residue.

Cover your windshield with a tarp, towel, or sheet, and weigh it down to prevent ice from building up.,
Spray either homemade or commercial ice-prevention spray on your windshield at night.,
Pour some rubbing alcohol into your windshield washer reservoir.,
Cover your car with a tarp whenever you aren't driving.",How to De‐ice Your Windshield2," Only use this method in areas with light snowfall, as it can be a heavy blanket to remove when weighed down with snow.


Soak the towel in a saltwater solution and lay it on your windshield overnight for even better protection. Dissolve a tablespoon of salt in one quart of water and immerse the towel in the solution. While it is still damp, position the towel onto your windshield and place your wipers over it to hold it securely.Your towel can be reused multiple times. Simply store it in a plastic bag after each use and add a small amount of water to keep it damp., You can buy professional products or mix three cups vinegar with one cup water for your own spray. Spray a light coat of a vinegar/water solution on your defrosted windows before bed to prevent ice the next morning.


Be very careful not to apply heavy coatings of vinegar to your car, because it may eat into the windshield, creating miniature pock marks in the glass. Applying vinegar to metal can also speed oxidation and result in rust or corrosion.

, This will help the wiper lines from freezing up and not working.


This trick will save you from having to go to the store to purchase proper windshield fluid. Remember, preventing and fighting ice build-up doesn't have to be a costly endeavor., Make sure to tie it down with bungee cables or some other fastenings to prevent it from slipping or being blown off.


Parking your car in garage is best. By protecting your car from even being exposed to the elements, you significantly reduce the amount of labor required to remove ice after the fact.
Though this prevents most ice build-up, you may notice some light frost on your windshield. However, this minor ice accumulation should melt shortly using your car's defrost function.

Let them stay there for about two weeks., Apply a layer of baking soda on the affected area to absorb moisture and spoiled milk odors. Baking soda works to filter the air and remove bad odors.Allow the area where the milk has spilled to dry completely before sprinkling baking soda directly on the area. Let it sit for three to four days, and then vacuum it out of the upholstery.

, Vinegar has strong, odor-fighting powers, so try using it if spoiled milk odors are present. This will help break up enzymes from the milk trapped in the car's upholstery and reduce the odors. Best of all, it is safe to use and does not contain any dangerous chemicals.Mix one part white vinegar with four parts water into a spray bottle. Spray the vinegar mixture directly to the affected area until it is completely drenched. Let it soak for about four to five hours, and then blot the area dry with a white wash cloth.Leave your car windows open to allow air ventilation., Purchase an enzyme cleaning product at your nearby home improvement store and spray any milk affected areas. The enzyme spray will eat away at the odor residues and leave a fresh scent behind.Let the enzyme spray to set in for one to two days, and then blot the area dry.
Do not use an enzyme spray on leather or suede.

, Carpet cleaners have strong chemicals in them that work to clean deep into fabrics. Just be sure to remove any moisture left behind after you have finished using the carpet cleaning.


Read the instructions to determine how long you need to leave on the product and then vacuum it out.

, One of the reason spoiled milk odors develop are because the moisture becomes trapped in the car and start to grow mildew. After a spill, or during a cleaning session, leave you car windows open and in the sun so the upholstery can dry out, and new air can flow in.

Wipe up any spills immediately.,
Let fresh air in.,
Keep the inside of the car clean.",How to Remove Spoiled Milk Odors from a Car's Interior3," The longer milk, or any type of spill sits, the harder it is to remove the stain and smell. The sooner you soak up the spill, the better your chances are at preventing a smell from forming.

, After milk is spilled, it is always a good idea to open the car windows for a few hours. This will allow any milk moisture that has evaporated into your car's air to leave and be replaced with fresh air., Food and liquid can provide favorable conditions for bacteria to begin growing and smelling. Regularly vacuuming and shaking off car floor mats can be a great way to prevent bad odors.

Pour cool water over the entire stain, wetting but not drenching the stain. Then blot it with a clean cloth.Adding water keeps the stain at the surface of the upholstery and prevents it from setting.
Blot the stain as opposed to rubbing it. Blotting encourages the stain to lift, whereas rubbing can force the stain deeper into the upholstery.
If the stain is old, still add water to the stain and blot briefly before turning to other methods. Just blotting alone won't eliminate an old stain, but it is still a good way of loosening the stain so that you can tackle it with other, more powerful methods.;
, Cleaning with baking soda is a highly effective method of removing many kinds of stains, including soda stains. Combine ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of baking soda with 1 cup (236.59 ml) of warm water and mix until you achieve a white paste., After you have mixed up the baking soda paste, use a toothbrush to apply it to the stain. Use gentle brushing motions to apply it to the entire stained area. Leave the paste on the stain for a half an hour. A toothbrush is a great tool to use because its bristles help to work the baking soda paste into the fabric. Leaving it to sit for a half an hour also helps the baking soda to penetrate the upholstery.

, After a half an hour, use a clean cloth to gently blot the stain. Use dabbing motions to lift up both the soda and the baking soda paste from the upholstery.

, The baking soda paste should have worked to lift up some or all of the soda stain.

Wipe down surfaces.,
Vacuum your floorboards and seats.",How to Organize a Car1," Start by removing items like work or sporting equipment. Depending on your activities, you may have gear that you use on the weekends, toys that belong to your children, or your gym bag. Place these items off to the side until you are ready to arrange them in your vehicle.

As you pull stuff out of the car, ask yourself if you really need to have it in your car at all times. In the case of your child’s sports equipment, your gym bag, or the tools you use for work, you may decide that you do need it. On the other hand, you might not need the large toy that your child no longer plays with or the summertime beach toys if it’s December.;
, Throw away or recycle items like old water bottles, food packaging, food bits, napkins, broken items, or other debris. You may want to use a trash bag or can for this step, depending on how much trash you have in your car.

Remember to look under the seats for trash that may have gotten pushed underneath.

, Go through your car and remove the smaller items, such as sunglasses, travel tissues, kids’ books, and CDs. Place these items near your larger items that you plan to return to the car.

As you remove the items from your car, see if any of the items can be placed inside your home rather than inside the car.

, Use a soapy rag or a product that is made to clean car interiors to wash the dirt and debris from the dashboard, console, steering wheel, doors, and especially the cup holders. Since cup holders often gather grime, do a second pass with a clean rag to make sure that you get all of the crumbs., While this step is optional, if you have kids, pets, or eat in your car a lot, it’s a good idea to vacuum it out. Crumbs can attract bugs and can start to smell over time. It will be easier to get yourself to maintain an organized vehicle if it is also clean.

Try using an attachment hose on your vacuum cleaner.
If you have a handheld vacuum, that can be a good option as well.
If you don’t own a vacuum cleaner and cannot borrow one, consider visiting a car wash. Most car washes have vacuums that are made just for cars, and oftentimes you don’t even have to get your car washed to use it.

Use color-coded bags in your console.,
Place your important documents in a special folder or bag.,
Use your cup holders for storage.,
Try a collapsible shelf.,
Carry a container for trash.,
Listen to your music electronically.",How to Organize a Car2," Use zipper bags such as cosmetic or pencil pouches to store items in your console. For example, you can put your sunglasses into one bag, reusable shopping bags into one, change for toll booths or meters in one bag, and your wet wipes, hand sanitizer, and cough drops into another. What you store will depend on what you carry.Look for bags around your home, but if you don’t have any, you can find them at your local department store or online.

, Go through your glove compartment and organize your paperwork such as your vehicle registration into a folder or plastic sleeve. This way you can easily access it when you need it.Look in the office supply section for the right sized product to meet your needs.

, If you have extra cupholders, then they could be used to store items. To make it look neat, place items in cups.

Since the shelf is collapsible, you can easily break it down so that you’ll have the use of your entire trunk space if you need it., While it’s tempting to just use a plastic grocery store bag, many people who spend a lot of time in their vehicle create trash everyday. Whether it’s from a quick fast food breakfast on your commute or from your child’s post-practice snacks, you will have trash in your car most days. Plan to either carry multiple bags in your car so that you can take in the trash each day, or carry a reusable bag that you can empty and carry with you everyday.

You can try small trash liners, like those for bathroom trash cans.
You could also leave several plastic grocery bags in your console or glove compartment. For example, you could bring out seven bags each Monday morning, refilling weekly to meet your needs.
If you don’t want to use plastic bags, try a reusable bag that you can empty each day or at the end of the week, depending on the size of your bag and how much trash you create.
You can also try a plastic cereal container.Depending on size, store your bag in the floorboard or behind the passenger seat.

, If you’re still carrying CDs, consider switching to digital music so that you can declutter the extra cases and CDs. Alternatively, try carrying just a few CDs at a time. Make a habit of switching them on a designated day."

Hang pockets from the back of your front seats.,
Attach hanging pockets on the sides of seats.,
Designate bins for each child’s equipment or toys.",How to Organize a Car3," If you have kids, then you will likely need to store their toys, snacks, and other items in places they can easily access. One great way to accomplish this is to use closet organizers such as shoe pockets. To use shoe pockets in your car, attach it to the back of your front seats and let it hang down. Place your child’s items into the pockets for easy organization.You can find hanging shoe organizers with small pockets in most department stores and online.
You may need to trim the shoe organizer to make it fit into your car. Depending on the size of your shoe organizer, you may be able to cut one in half and use one half on each of the car seats.
Secure your shoe organizer to the seat by attaching adhesive velcro to the back of it. The velcro should stick to the fabric on your seat. If it doesn’t, consider attaching the other side of the velcro to the back of the seat.
Teach your child how to use the pockets. Say, “This is where your books go. When you finish looking at one, put it back in the pocket.”

, If your car has back seats that are separated, such as in a van or SUV, take advantage of the space between the seat and the floor by adding a storage solution for your kids. Similar to the shoe pockets, you can find smaller pocket organizers that fit on the sides of seats. A remote control holder is perfect because it’s already made to fit under a chair cushion and then hang down to just above the floor.Place the items that your child uses most frequently next to them in their seat. For example, you could reserve one pocket to hold your child's snacks so that when they get hungry they can get the snack themselves.

, Use storage bins to organize toys, school supplies, and sports equipment. Depending on what you need to store inside your vehicle, storage bins can be a big help. You may try them in your trunk or hatchback, or you can designate one bin for each of your children.Try organizing sports equipment into bins. Not only can it make stacking your items easier and more convenient, but you’ll be able to easily find all of the equipment in one place.
Consider getting a special bin for each of your kids to use for their items. Tell them that they can only carry in the car what will fit into their bin, and then let them decide what to put in the bin. Put the kids in charge of keeping their items in the bins. If they fail to put an item away, remove it yourself and make them earn back the item.

Remove interior plastic coverings.,
Leave the windows open.,
Park your car outside if possible.,
Leave your car out in the hot sun.,
Leave the heat on for several hours.,
Keep the vents in your car running fresh air.",How to Get Rid of New Car Smell1," One of the main culprits of the chemically new car scent are the plastic coverings that keep the interior pristine. Remove all the plastic coverings from the inside of your car, including the seat covers, the plastic around the dashboard and cup holders, and the lining on the interior doors of the car., If weather permits, leave the windows open in your car as you are driving around, and consider leaving them open overnight to let the chemical scent escape and let the fresh air come in. Try to keep the windows open when you can as long as you still smell the new car scent., Even if you don’t feel safe leaving your car’s windows open overnight, try to park your car outside when you’re not driving it. Since some of the odor comes from the exterior car polish and window cleaner, leaving your car out in open air still helps to air out the scent of the exterior., Though it’s difficult to say why it is effective, leaving your car in the hot sun with the windows cracked is an effective way of “baking” away the stubborn new car scent. Try to leave the car in the sun for at least two hours to lessen the car smell., If it’s a gloomy day or the sun isn’t out in your area, another way to bake out the smell of your car is to close the windows and keep the heat on high for several hours. After two to three hours, turn the heat off and open the windows to let the car air out.

Make sure you do this outside, as doing it in a sealed garage will cause carbon monoxide to build up in the air.

, Something you want to avoid when you’re driving is to re-circulate the chemical-filled air inside your car. When you’re in your car, run the vents on high under the “fresh air” setting rather than the “recirculate” setting to bring air from outside into your car."
"
Use baking soda to soak up the scent.,
Soak up the scent with vinegar.,
Place barbecue charcoal under the seats.",How to Get Rid of New Car Smell2," To absorb the odor of the car’s interior, place a few scoops of baking soda in an uncovered container like a bowl or Tupperware container. Place the container in a secure location of your car where it won’t get knocked over and let the baking soda absorb the noxious odor of the car for about a day.If the smell still persists after a day, empty out and replace the baking soda. You can also try other absorbent substances that may work better at soaking up the smell.

, White vinegar is another absorbing agent that is effective at combating strong smells. If using baking soda didn’t work, add two parts of vinegar to one part water in a small container like a jar with a few holes poked in the top of the lid. Place the jar or container in a secure place in your car, then leave it there for about a day so that the vinegar can soak up and mask the odor., Another unlikely but effective absorber of scents is barbecue charcoal. To use, place a couple pieces of charcoal on top of paper towels and put them under the driver’s and passenger’s seats for a couple of days or until the odor is gone."
"
Clean the interior of your car.,
Get your car detailed.,
Steam clean your seats.",How to Get Rid of New Car Smell3," Since the new car scent is caused in part by the new plastic of the interior of the car, cleaning and wiping interior plastic surfaces can help to remove the odor. Use a gentle cleanser and a microfiber cloth to clean any plastic interior surfaces such as the door or the steering wheel. After using the cleanser, wipe surfaces with a damp cloth to make sure the cleanser is completely removed from the plastic and doesn’t leave streaks., Another way to clean away the new car smell smell is to get your seats and carpet shampooed at a detailing shop. Seats and carpeting are often made of absorbent material, which may absorb and trap the new car odor. Even though detailing is usually done to remove dirt and dust, it can work to remove bad odors as well.You can also do this yourself by buying products made specifically for the materials in your car interior and following the instructions on the label.
Getting this procedure done is effective but can be quite expensive, so you may want to try other methods and use this as a last resort.

, An alternative to shampooing your car seats is to steam clean them. Steam cleaners shoot steam deep into upholstery to break down and eliminate bad scents. You can buy or rent steam cleaners in many home improvement stores, but be careful to follow the instructions on the label as steam can burn if used improperly."
"
Use air fresheners.,
Buy an industrial strength odor eliminator.,
Use other strong scents to mask the smell.",How to Get Rid of New Car Smell4," If you have tried airing out and cleaning your new car, you should have been successful in eliminating most of the odor. If you have a small amount of odor left, you can easily mask it by hanging an air freshener from your rearview mirror or spraying around a deodorizing spray. Use your favorite scent and make sure the freshener is near the driver’s side of the car so that you can smell it., If you want to do more than just mask the smell, consider buying an industrial strength odor eliminator. These can be found at automotive stores and are formulated specifically for neutralizing bad car odors., There are certain smells that are extremely potent and have a reputation for lingering. The smell of fast food or popcorn for instance can often linger long after the food is eaten. Perfumes and colognes are also formulated to have a lasting scent. Introduce a new scent into your car that you know will be able to last and mask the new car smell until it is gone.Only do this if you like the smell that you are introducing, or else you could have an even bigger problem on your hands!

Spray the stained area with the solution.,
Press a dry, clean towel over the wet area.,
Remove the towel when it's soaked.,
Watch out for the smell!",How to Get Salt Stains out of Your Car's Carpet," Vinegar is a natural cleaning agent that, while it certainly doesn't smell good, sure is powerful. If you don't have a bottle, mix it up in a bucket or bowl.


Don't have vinegar? You could use dishwashing detergent, but it probably won't be as effective. There's also carpet shampoos and salt cleaners, but if you had those, you probably wouldn't be on this page.;
, If you're not using a spray bottle, pour a small amount on the area, saturating it.


If you have a scrubbing brush, you could use it at this point if you'd like. You want to do it delicately, however; the aim is to stir up the salt, not to dig it in deeper. Just lightly scrub the carpet, stirring the stain to the surface.

, Dab the area gently -- again, not forcing the stain down, but absorbing what's come to the top.

, If it's soaked and there's still liquid left, grab another towel and repeat.


You could also finish the job off with a wet/dry vacuum. Just dab the towel on the area, pull out your vacuum, and start sucking up the salt stain. This is a good method for the smell, too.
If the stain looms, repeat the process a few times. Salt can be stubborn, but it's definitely removable. If vinegar doesn't work (with a few applications, it should), look into a product that is specifically designed for road salt removal.

, After you've applied your vinegar, the last thing you want is to be smelling like your rancid car on your way to work. Get the fresh air going as soon as you the stains are all gone and you're completely finished.


If it's your floor mats that are the culprit, remove them and hang them to dry (just make sure you don't get new salt stains underneath them!).
If the stains are on an area that you can't remove, roll your windows down and air out the car.

Because types and sources of odors vary, this article doesn't cover remedies for the odor itself, concentrating on locating and removing it.",How to Find the Source of a Bad Odor in a Car," To rid a car from odor, determine the source by considering typical origins of odors. The most common is kids spilling food or beverages, and if this is obvious, get a can of carpet and upholstery cleaner and treat it according to label.;
, If the odor is a mildew-like musk, you may have a leaky floorboard, for instance a loose chassis drain plug allowing rain to splash inside. A wet car carpet will grow mildew and mold rapidly, especially with closed windows. Feel the carpet, especially the lower floor board sections where water might accumulate. When ""damp spots"" are located, apply a weak solution of chlorine bleach, not exceeding 2 oz per gallon. Then speed dry with either a wet/dry shop vac or airing out with windows down in the sun. With unexplained floor wet spots, crawl under the car and look for plugs missing and openings. These plugs are black rubber inserts, about 1.5""X 3"", placed in lower parts of the car floor.

, Most back seats remove by lifting at the front edge and sliding forward. The force required to remove the seat varies and some cars may have threaded fasteners which would need removing.

, Since AC acts as a dehumidifier, this filter can dampen with condensation, becoming moldy, blowing odors into the car. By selecting 'return air' or 'recirculate' on the AC controls, less moisture enters the system, decreasing the water being removed at the evaporating coil, decreasing possibility of smelly mold. The filter is replaceable but complicated, so consult a professional in this instance.

, It is not unusual for these to cause odors, but not normally detectable except when the car is idling or traveling at low speed. Gasoline odor is especially serious, and if you think you may have a fuel leak it should get immediate attention. Antifreeze has a unique, sickly-sweet odor, and a radiator leak will cause the engine temperature to rise, boil over and quit. Oil leaks, especially above the exhaust manifold where the dripping oil actually burns off, can smell, but at highway speed it will likely disperse to drivers behind you. An engine exhaust leak has very low odor potential, but if you suspect one, it can be the most serious of all. When the engine runs, these fumes can accumulate inside the car, becoming very toxic when concentrated. Mostly, significant exhaust leaks cause loud exhaust sounds.

, If you have not succeeded in finding the odor source, it could be road-kill under the chassis. You may notice this distinct odor at one of the quarter panels, and a car wash pressure washer, to thoroughly spray out the suspect area, could help. Do not spray water up into the engine compartment and knock wiring couplers, vacuum hoses and even spark plug wires loose.

,, A variety of commercial deodorizers and cleaning products help, also, an open a box of baking soda. Shoe ""Odor Eaters"" can be placed under seats, but unless you eliminate the odor source, anything is just a stop-gap solution.

After the car has been cleaned, remove any residual odor with an ozone shock treatment using an ozone generator.,
Spend a little bit of money to have a professional worry about it.",How to Get Rid of Tobacco Odors in Cars," A regular old carper cleaner should do a good job here, or you can spring for heavy-duty if the smell is particularly bad. Then go through the mats and give them a good vacuum.


Even if you can't clean the mats at least vacuum them. This alone may help the smell. You're likely to remove small particles that have been thoroughly soaked with or cloaked by smoke, if not remove some of the smell itself.





;
, It goes without saying, but it needs to be said. After cleaning the ashtray out, spray some ordinary air freshener into it out rub around with an absorbent kitchen paper. This will leave a thin layer of the air freshener in the ashtray. The layer is not enough for the ashtray to be flammable but it is enough to have retain a pleasant scent.

, Of course, if you're trying to hide the fact that you've been cleaning the car, or that the car needed cleaning in the first place, then hanging a loud car freshener is likely to attract some suspicion. But if you're just concerned with removing noxious odors from your vehicle, then hanging an air freshener or vent can make a big difference.

, Unlock the doors, turn the engine on, and put your car's heat and air into recirculate while you clean the rest of the car. As you continue to clean the car and remove some of the smoky odors, the new, fresh air will recirculate throughout the entire cabin and improve the quality of air in your car.


If you really think your car needs it, consider replacing the cabin's air filter. Consider changing your car's air filters every 12,000–15,000 miles (19,000–24,000 km), or at least once a year. If you can't remember the last time you changed them or had them replaced, do yourself a favor and go for it. It should make a difference.







, Fabric and upholstery cleaner, such as Scotchgard fabric and upholstery cleaner, does a pretty good job of neutralizing offending odors. Spray on seats, floor mats and even seat belts — pretty much anywhere there's exposed fabric. Following manufacturer's directions, scrub the cleaner into the fabric with a soft-bristled brush big enough to do the job.


You may want to consider getting an antibacterial one, as these can work better with smoke smells. Either way, this shouldn't be your last resort.






This may be less convenient, but removing your seats from the car before you clean them will have a drastic effect on removing the odor. There is a lot of carpet under seats that is difficult to reach but that still absorbs smoke smells. Removing the seats and then cleaning them will allow you to get at the hard-to-reach areas where the smoke odors may be hiding. This makes a huge difference., It may sound odd, but it really works. Pet odor eliminators, especially those used to remove urine stains and (most importantly) smells, can work wonders. Try out a product like Nature's Miracle for a miraculous finish.

, Dryer sheets also work to keep a car smelling fresh. Just place several sheets or a small, opened box of dryer sheets someplace in the car, like under the car's four seats. When exposed to heat from the sun, the dryer sheets will release a fresh scent. A box of dryer sheets will freshen your car for a long time and could be less expensive than buying numerous car fresheners.


Dryer sheets will absorb unpleasant odors after a while. Not only this, but their ability to release pleasant odors will be somewhat diminished after time. Be sure to replace them every so often.







, Use Lysol, for example, or very low concentration bleach water, for best results. Find the air intake (typically under the hood right close to the windshield) and, with the fan on in the car, spray with a water bottle. This will clean out some odor that's stagnated inside the ducts.

, Apply the shampoo directly to the carpets and/or seats. Work the shampoo into the fabric with a brush or cloth (brush works best). Then vacuum up the remaining shampoo with an extractor, which you may be able to rent from an auto detailer or local supply store.

, Baking soda is a natural deodorant that has so many uses it's almost criminal. Especially for cars with fabric interiors, this option works great. For heavy-duty smells, you'll need about a whole one-pound packet of sodium bicarbonate. Here's what you do:


Sprinkle the baking soda over as many porous surfaces as possible. These include the mats, seats, roof (try using a duster to fling the baking soda onto the carpeted roof), and wherever else the smell may have permeated.






Work the baking soda into whatever surface it's on. You can use a cloth, a brush, or even your hands to work the baking soda into the fabric.






Wait for at least 30 minutes, or up to a day. The longer you wait, the longer the baking soda's deodorizing properties get to work on your smelly ride.






After the allotted waiting time, vacuum up any remaining baking soda. Be sure to take at least two whole passes to remove any baking soda, along with particulates that may be causing the car to smell.







, To make the mixture, combine 1/4 cup of vinegar (white not cider) with 2 cups of water. Pour into your sprayer and shake. Mist the windows and the cloth interior with the vinegar-water mixture before wiping any any excess. As it's applied, mixture may be redolent of vinegar, but the vinegar smell wears off quickly once it's dried.

, If you don't like the smell of coffee, you may be out of luck on this one, although the tactic really does work. Place six paper plates strategically throughout the car; onto each plate, spoon one cup of roasted coffee, evenly spread out across the entire plate. Keeping the windows down about an eighth of an inch, allow the coffee smell to permeate the car on a warm, sunny day. After a day, remove the coffee beans and enjoy the smell of your latte... er, car!

, Although not a surefire way of removing bad smoke odors from your car, this method is reputed to work because newspaper is an odor absorbent. Crumple up a good number of old newspaper sheets and place them strategically throughout your cabin. Wait 48 hours for the newspaper to absorb all the smoke smells, and then remove the newspaper and recycle.


As much most of the methods detailed in this article, this method can work in combination with other methods. Use this method to increase your chances of removing odors while placing coffee beans in your car, for example, or when coating it with baking soda.

, You can find activated charcoal at pet supply stores, health food stores, or even bigger department stores. Place a cup or so of activated charcoal, which comes in powder form, in a bowl, and then place that bowl in your car. Wait for a day or two, after which time the charcoal should have worked its magic and absorbed a lot of the smells of smoke from your car.


Some animal products have activated charcoal in them, at far less cost. Kitty litter, for example, may contain it. In the end — it might be cheaper — and just as effective to place a bowl of kitty litter in your car rather than buy a huge supply of activated charcoal and only use it once.Activated charcoal is a quite strong natural odor eliminator. If you've tried using baking soda and it's not eliminated the smell of smoke completely, try this method. It should neutralize the odor very well.

, A cup or so will do the job. Ammonia is very harsh, so be sure not to bunk up in the car while the ammonia is work on eliminating the car's odors. After removing, open the windows and air out the car for an hour or two before using the car. Repeat this every night for a week or two if the odor isn't eliminated after a single use.

, Instead of masking the odor, the ozone generator will completely remove it. The ozone actually oxidizes and denatures the residual organic compounds causing the odor.

, Getting your car detailed by a professional will cost a little bit more money, but you won't have to worry about removing the smell yourself, and you rest assured that the car detailer is drawing on a wealth of experience and resources in order to get your car back to its cleanest, natural state.

To pick a scent, simply find one that appeals to your sense of smell. No matter what kind you get, be sure to place it in an area that gets lots of airflow, so that the scent circulates throughout the car.


Vent clip and dashboard air fresheners are meant to be clipped to or positioned over the vents.
Tree-style and other air fresheners can be placed hanging from the rear view mirror, or under the dash—where the passenger’s feet go—to get the most circulation.;
, Spray or aerosol-style air fresheners can also be used in cars to mask smells and leave a fresh scent. Spray the liquid into the air in the car, rather than directly onto the seats, dash, floor, or roof. You can use a regular house and home spray like Lysol or Febreze, or you can purchase one that’s made specifically for cars, such as:


Chemical Guys new car smell
K1 air freshener for cars
Armor All new car smell air freshener

, Instead of purchasing an air freshener, you can also use a few spritzes of your favorite cologne or perfume to make the inside of your car smell nice. As with the air freshener, don’t spray the liquid directly onto any of the car’s surfaces.


If you have an old tree-style air freshener lying around that doesn’t have any scent left, you can spray perfume directly on this and place it back in the car.

, Scented candles come in hundreds of different smells, and there's no reason you can't use them to make your car smell nice.Look for a smaller candle that will fit under the driver or passenger seat. A tea light or votive will be a good size.


Don’t use candles that are in jars, otherwise you won’t be able to smell them.

, Take a new box of dryer sheets and open the box. Place the box under the driver or passenger seat to give your car that fresh laundry smell.To make for a slower release of the scent, keep the box sealed and poke a couple holes in the top and sides.

, Sometimes a smell gets into your car and just won’t leave, and the first thing you can do is try to force the smell out. Pick a warm day, and make sure you don’t have any papers or garbage in the car that could fly out while you're driving.


If you don’t want to drive around with the windows open, leave the car in the driveway with the windows down and the doors open on a windy day, and hopefully some of the smell will blow out., Certain smells, like smoke, can get into everything in a car, and sprinkling baking soda everywhere will help draw out and neutralize some of the odors that are in the seats and floors.Don’t forget the floor mats, under the floor mats, and the space between the back seats and the rear window.
Be sure the floors and upholstery are completely dry before you sprinkle on the baking soda.
Let the baking soda sit for three to four hours., This is important to clean up the baking soda, but it will also help remove bad odors, plus any dirt or crumbs that are in the car. Be sure to use the upholstery attachment so that you can get into all the nooks and crannies between the seats, under the seats, and elsewhere.When you're finished vacuuming, leave the floor mats out of the car.

, When you know of specific stains or marks in your car that need cleaning, spot clean them with a rag and the appropriate cleaner. The right cleaner will depend on what kind of stain you're dealing with:Tackle mold and mildew with disinfectant sprays.
Address bodily fluids (such as vomit) and food stains with bio-enzymatic cleaners.
For really powerful smells—think skunk—use an oxidizing cleaner.

, In a clean spray bottle, mix a fifty-fifty solution of white vinegar and water. Starting with the driver seat, spray down the entire seat with the solution and then wipe it with a lint-free or microfiber cloth. Then do the passenger seat, followed by the back seats, the dash, the floors, the mats, and any remaining surfaces.Then


It may take a while for the vinegar smell to dissipate, but it will work to help remove most smells, even cigarette smoke., Fill a bucket with several drops of dish soap and some warm water. Place the mats on the lawn, driveway, or garage floor. Dip a shoe brush in the soapy water and scrub the mats with the suds. When you're finished, spray the mats with water from a hose or pressure washer.Hang the mats to dry over a railing or on a clothesline.

, There are many products that you can use that will neutralize odors in your car, and you can actually leave the products in the car to continue working even after you remove the smell.


Place some freshly ground coffee beans in a jar with a plastic lid. Poke holes in the lid and place the jar somewhere in your car.Keep an open box of baking soda in your car to absorb and neutralize smells.Leave a few orange peels under the front seat to neutralize odors and leave a fresh citrus smell in the car.Charcoal is another traditional odor neutralizer, so you can even place a couple lumps under the driver or passenger seat to control smells in your car., It can be easy to forget that sandwich in the back seat, or the cereal that spilled the other day, or the leftover apple in the cup holder, but always make an effort to remember to clean these things from your car daily. Food will rot quickly in a car, and what began as a mildly unpleasant odor can quickly become an unshakable smell of decaying organic matter.

, Never leave garbage in your car, especially when it’s food related. This includes wrappers, fast food bags and containers, coffee cups, and any other refuse. When you exit your car at the end of the day, take with you any garbage you’ve accumulated over the day and recycle or dispose of it properly., If you're driving when a spill occurs, pull over when it’s safe to do so and remove food spills and soak up any liquids you can.When you get home or to a car wash, address the spot with a cleaner, such as soapy water, vinegar, or another cleaner of your choice.


It’s a good idea to keep a few old towels or paper towels in the car to deal with emergencies and spills.

, Air-conditioning systems get quite damp, and this can lead to mold growth and bad smells in the car. To prevent this, turn on the air-conditioning and the blower weekly or every two weeks. Allow the air-conditioning to blow for about 10 minutes."

You may want to double bag the ice cubes to ensure the plastic doesn’t tear as you press the cubes into the gum.A sealable bag is your best choice because it will trap the water as the ice cubes melt.
You may want to place a rag between your hand and the ice cubes to make it more comfortable.;
, Touch one of the ice cubes through the plastic onto the gum. If it’s warm out, you may need to switch to the other ice cubes as the first cube melts or breaks apart. Keep the ice in contact with the gum until it freezes all the way through and is hard to the touch.The gum needs to freeze all the way through to stop sticking on the other side.
Get more ice cubes if you need to.

, Instead of using ice cubes, you can also use canned air. Insert the straw nozzle from the canned air into the gum and spray. Remove the nozzle and the edges of the gum as well until the piece of gum is frozen solid.Be careful not to insert the nozzle too deep so as to pop the gum and make a bigger mess.
Be careful, the temperatures coming from the canned air can be cold enough to hurt you.

, Once the gum is completely frozen, use a butter knife to scrape it off of the upholstery. Most of the gum should come off in one piece, but there may be bit of gum or residue still stuck to the seat or carpet.Try to pick out any bits of gum that remained, or reapply ice to them to freeze them as well.
Once the gum warms up, it will be hard to remove again.

, Once the gum itself is removed, use a carpet or upholstery cleaner to clean the area and ensure there is no stain left behind after the gum has been removed.Follow the directions on the upholstery or carpet cleaner of your choice.

Pour a bit of Goo Gone or similar adhesive remover onto a rag. It doesn’t need to be much.A small dab will suffice for testing the effect the adhesive remover has on the cloth.
Do not spray the adhesive remover directly onto your carpet or upholstery.

, Find a spot that is not easily visible and rub the adhesive remover into the carpet or upholstery with the rag. Use a dry rag after to wipe it away and allow it to dry completely.Wait a few minutes for it to dry then look for signs of damage to the carpet or upholstery.
It’s important to let it dry to ensure it does not discolor the material.

, If the adhesive remover does not damage the material you tested it on, pour more of it onto the rag. Depending on the amount of gum and the size of the area, you may need to use quite a bit more adhesive remover.Don’t pour so much adhesive remover onto the rag that is saturates it, as it can cause irritation to your skin.
Be extremely careful not to get any adhesive remover in your eyes.

, Use the rag and adhesive remover to scrub the gum. The adhesive remover will cause it to break up, trapping some of the gum in the rag and possibly creating small bits of gum that have come apart. These bits should be vacuumed up quickly.Once the adhesive remover dries, those small bits of gum will be difficult to remove, so act quickly.
The gum itself should come apart, so try to pinch it with the rag to remove it from the seat or carpet.

, Once all of the gum has been removed, use an upholstery or carpet cleaner of your choice to wash the adhesive remover and gum residue off the area the gum used to be.If you don’t clean the area, a dark stain may persist where the gum was stuck.

Pull a four or five inch strip of duct tape off the roll.,
Wrap the duct tape around your hand, sticky side out.,
Press the tape into the gum.,
Pull the tape away rapidly.",How to Remove Gum From a Car's Interior3," If there are bits of gum you aren’t able to remove using another method, try pulling a strip of duct tape off the roll that is large enough to wrap around your hand.Duct tape’s adhesive can help get small bits of gum out of carpet or upholstery that other methods may not reach.
This method is best when used after another method to remove the majority of the gum.

, With the adhesive side of the duct tape facing outward, wrap the tape around your four outstretched fingers so you can use them to press the sticky side of the duct tape into the bits of gum on the carpet or upholstery.Stick the tape to itself after you’ve wrapped it around your hand.
Rotate the tape as you go so you will always have a fresh, sticky surface to try to stick to the gum.

, Press a portion of the tape down into the upholstery or carpet with your index, middle and ring finger firmly. Once the tape is pressed down onto the gummy area, rub the back of the duct tape with your fingers to ensure the adhesive has come into contact with as much of it as possible.You may need to do this multiple times if there are bits of gum scattered about from previous attempts to remove it.

, Yank the tape straight backward, allowing the adhesive to remove the gum from the carpet. There will likely be fuzz and lint stuck to the tape from the upholstery or carpet, so turn the tape on your hand and repeat the process until you are able to remove all of the bits of gum.Replace the piece of tape if need be.

Otherwise, just give it a good soaking to get it wet., Add a few drops of mild laundry or dish soap to a bucket and fill it with water. Soak a sponge, cloth, or cleaning brush in the solution. Then scrub both sides of the mat down until it's clean.Some people use degreasers and foam cleaners to clean their mats, but Weather technology  advises against anything harsher or more abrasive than mild detergent. These may cause damage to the mats.
Additionally, WeatherTech strongly advises against using any silicone-based agent. These may cause the mats to be slippery, even after drying, which is especially dangerous for the driver’s side mat.

, Hose the mat off again until all traces of soap have been removed. Either allow it to air-dry or thoroughly towel-dry before reinstalling. When you put the mat back in, make sure it’s on the appropriate side of the car (driver’s side versus passenger side). Reattach all retention hooks to ensure the mat doesn’t slip out of place.When you reinstall the driver’s mat, double-check that it doesn’t interfere with the pedals before you drive your vehicle again.

Place cupcake liners inside cup holders.",How to Collect Trash in Your Car1," Keeping trash bags in your car will help you collect trash as necessary instead of just tossing it onto the floor. Among the most inexpensive options is to use an empty tissue box. Fill it with plastic bags saved from trips to the grocery or convenience store, and grab a bag whenever you need one., If you’re not a fan of using disposable plastic bags, you can use a plastic or glass sealable food storage container. Typically used for storing cereal, you can find a storage container at a grocery or home goods store.Try sticking velcro strips to the bottom so you can secure the storage container to the floor.
You always can line it with a trash bag to easily dispose of the trash you’ve collected. To cut down on disposable plastic, just throw your trash in it, empty it out into your home trash receptacle, then wash it. Try using a container for recyclables and one for non-recyclable trash.

, Instead of using empty tissue boxes or cereal storage containers, you could always buy a trash can designed specifically for cars. Many models come with either strips that secure it to the car floor or straps that hang it from one of the front seats.You can buy one online or find one at an auto or home improvement store.

Vacuum loose dirt in addition to regularly wiping the interior down., The less chemicals you use on leather interior the better. Before you use a general cleaner on accumulated dirt, try wiping it off with just a water dampened sponge first. Use an all-purpose cleaner if only water doesn't work.

, A general all-purpose cleaner is great at cleaning leather interior that's fairly dirty. Spray the cleaner on in sections no larger than 6 inches (15 cm) and make sure it doesn’t dry into the surface, because dirt can soak deeper into the leather.Swap your commercial all-purpose cleaner with an environmentally friendly cleaner made out of three parts white vinegar to one part water.

, Microfiber is strong enough to wipe away residue from the interior, yet gentle enough to use on leather. Immediately after you spray each section with an all-purpose cleaner, wipe it dry with a smooth microfiber cloth. Spray cleaner on each dirty section and repeat as needed.

, Neglected leather interior can have a thick layer of grime that only a degreaser product can address. Look for one online, or at your local automotive or home store. Check labels to make sure you can use it on leather interior. Some can be mixed in increasing concentrations to use for all-purpose cleaning up to heavy degreasing., Just like regular maintenance using an all-purpose cleaner, spray the stronger degreaser cleaner on in sections no larger than 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm). Make sure the degreaser does not dry into the leather.

, Directly after you spray degreaser on in a section, scrub the area with a medium to soft bristle brush. Use medium pressure to agitate and remove dirt from any textured areas of the leather. Work quickly and remember not to let the cleaner dry up.If you want to make your own scrub brush, substitute a painter’s brush with a nylon bristle one. Cut the length of the bristles in half for more scrub control on the leather., Areas like the sides of seats and door handles can be hard to get to with a handheld bristle or makeshift painter’s brush. Scrub these areas with an old toothbrush or a cheap one you can throw away afterwards. Depending on how much dirt you need to clean off, the toothbrush may not be usable. Determine if it needs to be thrown out by looking at the bristles. Throw it away if they're flattened down, and if they won't rinse clean.

, A smooth microfiber cloth will wipe away all the grease and grime you scrubbed up. Wipe each section dry as you work through the entire interior of your car.

, Make sure leather interior does not dry out by using a leather conditioner on it twice a year. There's no need to condition every time you wipe it down, but make sure you condition after a heavy cleaning. Apply a thorough conditioning cream on the interior if you used a degreaser.

, Go to your local automotive store and purchase foam applicator pads. Apply a gumball-sized amount of leather conditioner onto one side and rub it around to saturate and soak into the foam., After you prime and saturate the foam applicator with conditioner, squirt a small amount more onto it and apply to the interior in sections no larger than 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm). Rub the pad into the leather using small circles and firm, but gentle pressure. Rub and watch the conditioner absorb into the leather for about 30 seconds.


Some leather interiors have a thick protective coating over leather. Don't worry and don't apply more conditioner if it doesn't readily absorb. Move on to the next step after 30 seconds.

, Too much leather conditioner can cause the leather to prematurely crack. Always wipe each area you apply conditioner to with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.

, Some areas of your interior see more action on a day-to-day basis than others. Make sure you fully condition areas like the armrest and driver-side bolster to help protect the life of your leather. After you apply one coat of conditioner over all of the interior, immediately wipe more conditioner over frequently used areas., Even if you do your best to work the same in each section, some areas will absorb the conditioner better than others. Reapply to areas that are dull looking and could use some extra TLC.

A wet/dry vac (shop-vac) is recommended because they are designed to remove moisture.Vacuum cleaners with hose attachments also work well because they have suctioning power.Take a hoover with 680 watts or more power, so you have more power. Then, take the mat and hoover it clean using a thin hose for better suction.

, To dry cloth floor mats, hang them up somewhere or dry them in a dryer. Floor mats get a damp musky smell if not dry.


You could also spray them with a clean fresh scent. Leave them outside in the sun to dry. This will also help freshen the smell.

Work on one seat or area at a time. Rinse each area thoroughly before moving onto the next area.
Use a microfiber cloth to dry the area.

, To make another natural, non-caustic cleaner, grate a bar of soap (such as Ivory) until you have 6 tablespoons worth. Add this and 2 tablespoons of borax to a bucket. Slowly add 2 cups of boiling water. You can also add 10 drops of lavender essential oil for fragrance if you want.

Use a leather-cleaning kit for leather seats.,
Turn on your heater.,
Pretreat stubborn stains on leather.,
Use a leather cleaner.,
Use a homemade mild cleaner.,
Thoroughly dry the leather.,
Use a water-based, pH neutral leather conditioner.,
Use a toothbrush to clean seams.,
Clean the floor mats.",How to Clean Car Upholstery4," Leather requires more careful care than fabric or vinyl upholstery, as it is more susceptible to aging and fading. The best option to clean leather is to use cleaners specifically made for leather, such as cleaners and conditioners. These are often available as a kit, such as the Wolfgang Leather Care Cockpit Kitor the Pinnacle Contours Interior Kit., Leather responds to heat and will accept cleaners and treatments more readily in a warm environment. If it’s hot where you live, then you don’t need to turn on the heater. But if it’s the middle of winter, turn on the heater for a few minutes to warm up the car before cleaning the leather.

, For stubborn stains on leather upholstery, pretreat the leather with a leather conditioner. Then apply a leather stain remover on the stain and rub it in. Allow it to sit for about 30 seconds and wipe off the stain remover.

, Apply the leather cleaner to your upholstery, focusing on one section or seat at a time. Use a soft cloth to rub the cleaner on the upholstery. Rinse off the cleaner thoroughly with clean water.


Follow the instructions on the product’s label for proper usage.

, You can mix some mild hand soap with warm water and wash the leather upholstery. Do not use very much water. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off the soapy mixture by using a clean cloth soaked in water to wipe off the soap., After you’ve cleaned the leather, make sure it is completely dry before you apply conditioner. While leather naturally repels water, it will not hold the conditioner if it’s wet.

, Leather conditioner will replenish the oils that make your leather smooth and rich-looking. Less expensive leather conditioners may be petroleum-based, which tend to cling to leather and can transfer to clothing. They may also leave a greasy finish on the leather. Using a water-based, pH neutral leather conditioner will ensure that your leather upholstery and your clothes are kept in good condition.Apply the conditioner to a cloth and wipe over the leather. Wipe away any excess conditioner and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes before using your car.

, On the seat upholstery, there are seams where the upholstery has been sewn together. Dirt and debris can easily gather here and it is often hard to lift this dirt with a vacuum or cloth. Use a toothbrush to get at these areas, scrubbing gently with your cleaner.

Use a wet/dry vacuum.,
Use plastic vacuum attachments.,
Move the seats.,
Take out floor mats.,
Vacuum frequently.",How to Clean Car Upholstery5," A wet/dry vacuum such as a Shop-Vac is a powerful and handy machine that can handle different types of vacuuming jobs. They usually have a long hose or nozzle and a long cord, which makes it easier to vacuum out a car.


Alternately, use a coin-operated vacuum at car wash. These also have long nozzles, but they require that you feed coins into a timed meter, which can interrupt your cleaning progress.
There are small handheld, portable vacuums that you can also use. These are usually good for spot cleaning but do not tend to have enough suction power to adequately vacuum out a car.

, Most vacuums have plastic attachments, which are superior to metal attachments. With metal, you run the risk of scratching your car or upholstery, particularly if you have leather or vinyl seats.Useful attachments are brushes with a wide square opening and a skinny, narrow attachment that can reach into crevices.

, When vacuuming a vehicle, make sure you are getting into all the crevices and cracks to suck up dirt and dust. Recline the seats to get at the inside crease of the seat. Move the seats forward to get underneath the seats.


Take out child car seats as well, so that you are sure to get underneath these, which tend to gather cereal, granola bars and crayons.

, Vacuum the upholstery on the floor by getting underneath the floor mats. This will also make it easier to deep-clean the floor mats.

, Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from becoming ground into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.

",How to Clean a Car Ceiling," A microfiber cloth is made from materials that will lift and collect the majority of loose dust, dirt, and grime from your car's ceiling.


Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth to gently rub the ceiling of your car in the direction of the grain in the headliner fabric.;
, The upholstery cleaner should be compatible with and safe to use on the ceiling's fabric type. For example, if your car's ceiling is made from vinyl, purchase a vinyl cleaner.


Visit a local retail store that specializes in auto parts and products to locate an upholstery cleaner that is safe to use on the ceiling fabric in your car.

, An upholstery shampoo or cleaner will remove any dust, dirt, and grime that the microfiber cloth was previously unable to remove.

, After the upholstery cleaner has worked itself into the headliner fabric, the microfiber cloth will remove any leftover stains, dirt, dust, and other grime.

, A mixture of 3 parts water and 1 part distilled white vinegar will remove grease stains from the headliner without affecting the glue and laminate that attaches the fabric to the ceiling.


Saturate a clean microfiber cloth with the water and vinegar mixture, then gently rub the cloth against the grease stain for removal.

, If your car's ceiling remains dirty after the first application of upholstery cleaner, the fabric must dry completely to prevent the wet glue from detaching the headliner fabric from the car's ceiling.

, Products such as these can help remove unpleasant smells such as cigarette smoke or food smells from the headliner.


Refrain from saturating the fabric of the car ceiling with air fresheners, as some air fresheners may contain chemicals that can eat away at the glue keeping the headliner fabric attached to the ceiling.

Vacuum the car.,
Steam clean the inside of the car.,
Once the car has been cleaned and has dried, check for odor.,
Deodorize the entire car.,
Replace the cabin air filter if the vehicle has one.,
After other cleaning options have been exhausted, use an ozone generator to do an ozone shock treatment to the vehicle.,
Seek professional help if the odor continues to linger after everything else you've tried.,
In future, clean up all spills immediately.",How to Remove Odors from Your Car," Start with the basics by clearing everything out of the car and removing all trash. Before wiping, shampooing, or adding anything to your car's interior carpet, upholstery, dashboard, etc., read the car's manual for warnings and advice on which cleaning products are safe to use in your car. If you're in any doubt, talk to your local automobile retailer for more advice based on your car.


Check under the seats and remove all rotting food, trash, and lost items.






Check back pockets and remove all items. Be careful if you have children as there may be sticky candies, or unidentified blobs of food stuck within the pocket.






If you have child seats in the car, check the pull-out drink containers and under the seat cover as well. Food and drink can be lodged in any of the these places without you realizing. Take the seats right out of the car for cleaning.






Don't forget to clean the back or trunk (boot) of the car as well. The odor could be coming from anywhere.





;
, Use a soft cleaning cloth to wipe every plastic, wood, glass, and metallic surface inside the car. If you want to use anything other than warm water, rely on mild detergent as it will be safe for most surfaces, and glass cleaner for glass. For leather seats, use an appropriate leather cleaner. Alternatively, you can ask for a suitable interior car cleaner at your automobile store. If it's a really hot day, leave the doors and windows open to let the car cool down first or it'll be hot and unpleasant as well as super odorous!


Wipe inside the glove compartment or glove box. Remove all items from it first, then wipe out everything.







, Use a soft but firm brush to loosen dirt and debris before vacuuming the car.Always use clean water and change frequently. Wring out all excess water so that there is no water pooling in the car.

, Remove any floor rugs that can be removed. Vacuum the carpet and the seats to remove excess dirt. Place the vacuum nozzle into all seats, open cushions up as much as you can to release the dirt from inside the cracks.


Sprinkle carpet deodorizer over the carpet. Leave it to sit for the time recommended on the package instructions before vacuuming up. This may reduce the odor levels if the source of the odors is within the car.






Vacuum the trunk too.







, After vacuuming, you might like to consider steam cleaning the floors using an appropriate interior car shampoo/enzymatic odor remover and an extracting machine (steam clean, steam extraction, or hot water extraction). Using an extracting machine will ensure that you get up as much dirt as possible.

Scrub the car upholstery and carpet to release the dirt trapped inside the fabric folds. Use a suitable car shampoo or enzymatic odor remover recommended by your automobile store and use a clean sponge for scrubbing.






Be wary of applying too much water, as this will take days to dry afterward, especially in cold conditions. And water that doesn't dry will leave a musty smell in the car,Try to get an extracting machine that has a clear nozzle. This will allow you to see the water that is being extracted from the seat. As soon as the water turns clear and you don't see any dirt coming up through it, this means your car seats are clean and that there is no more dirt inside them. It also indicates that when they dry, they'll come up looking like new again.
Repeat the process over any stubborn stains. Stains may be a source of odor, so their removal is crucial for that reason as well as for appearance. Stains can indicate heavy soil, dirt, food, drink, or even water marks from an open window.
At the end of this process, the seats will be slightly damp but they shouldn't be any more than towel damp. If you find there is excess water, continue using the extracting machine to withdraw any more water from the seats until they become less damp.







, If you can still detect an odor at this point, (or if you know where the odor is coming from and don't want to clean the whole car), it's time to target the possible causes and see if you can apply direct solutions to tackle precise odors. Here are some possibilities:


Bacteria: This will usually occur because you've left food to rot in the car, or some other natural item, such as garden bits and pieces from people's shoes. The best method for treating this is to remove the offending food or plant life, and to clean the patch left behind. Then apply an enzyme or bacteria digester, available from cleaning supplies stores. Follow the instructions on the packaging.







Cigarette smoke: If you smoke in your car, then this will be obvious but even someone else smoking in the car unbeknownst to you can leave a lingering odor. To try to get rid of it, place two towels into two separate plastic bowls and fill with white distilled vinegar. If the car is really big, use additional bowls. Place the plastic bowls into the car with the vinegar-soaked towels. One should sit near the ashtray, and the other one on the backseat. The vinegar will absorb the cigarette odors from the car, so that when you remove the bowls, the odor should leave too. If needed, repeat. You can also try sprinkling baking soda and/or carpet deodorizer over the upholstery and carpet respectively, leave for a few hours, and then vacuum it up. If you or somebody else regularly smokes in the car though, the odor will always be present, so the best thing to do is to stop smoking in the car.






Fire smoke: If your car has been damaged by fire, the smoke smell will be trapped in the upholstery and other porous surfaces. In this case, you are probably best to get professional detailing on the car interior. Try the vinegar method first but if it doesn't work, seek professional advice.

Mildew or mold: Check for leaks first, as you'll want to prevent any water from getting into the car from the exterior. If that is not an issue, the mildew or mold may have occurred because of rotting food, a spilled drink, or the addition of water from shoes, wet sporting equipment, or other wet gear being placed in the car and left there. Remove any contaminants such as rotting food and clean the area of the car. Spray the carpet with Lysol for mildew, if you believe that is the source of the odor. Also read How to get rid of carpet mold for more information.






Vomit (pet or human): Read these wikiHow resources for more information – How to clean pet vomit from carpet, How to clean vomit out of carpet, and How to clean up your dog's vomit while in the car. This is an odor source that is best cleaned up immediately, because the stomach acids in vomit cling to the fiber and can damage it.Urine: A strong odor, urine should be removed from the car as soon as possible. Clean the urine first and try to eliminate the stain. Use a stain remover that is suitable for the upholstery, carpet, or other surface being cleaned. Then, checking that it is all right to apply to the relevant surface, consider using a pet urine odor remover. If using this on upholstery or carpet, blot rather than rub to remove it after it has sat for the time suggested by the packaging. This will avoid harming the fibers. Shampoo as directed earlier.






Milk: Milk spills on carpet, leather, or upholstery should be cleaned immediately as they will both stain and cause a bad odor. For leather seats, moisten a cloth and wring out excess water. Wipe over the stain and pick up all the milk. Be sure to get into any cracks in the seat as well. Leave to dry, then apply a leather cleaner. For carpet spills, remove a mat if it's on the mat and clean the mat separately. If on the carpet itself, apply clean water and constantly blot to remove the milk. Allow to air-dry - if you use a heat dryer source, the milk may adhere to the carpet and start to smell very bad.







, Once you've cleaned the car and looked for particular odors, consider doing an overall deodorizing of the car to try to finish off any lingering odors. Here is what to do:

Armed with a spray bottle of a quality odor neutralizer, begin by opening the hood of your car in a well-ventilated (preferably outdoor) location.






Start the engine and set the parking brake for safety. Next, place the AC (air-conditioning) and fan on full. Important: make sure the ""fresh air/recirculate"" setting is in the ""Fresh Air"" (outside air) position.






Go to the front fender side of the car (usually the passenger side) and look in the engine compartment. Find the AC/heater ""Air Intake"", sometimes called the cowl vent. Different vehicles use different air intake vent configurations but all are just below the bottom edge of the windshield, normally on the passenger side, and all have some sort of screen, grid or louvers covering the intake.






Liberally spray the deodorizer directly into the intake screen.






After a few sprays, get back in the car and smell to determine if the deodorizer is circulating through the AC system.






Repeat if necessary. This application should treat the air conditioning evaporator, blower, and ducting, the places where smoke and odor particles will collect.






Now, switch the AC/heater control to ""Full Heat"", leaving the engine running, the air control in ""Fresh Air"" position and the fan on full.






Go back outside the car and repeat the spray treatments into the air intake as you did earlier.






By switching to the heat position, the deodorizer is now treating the heater core, blower, and ducting, another place that odors will hide.






Repeat spraying if necessary.







, This might make an importance difference. Refer to the car owner's manual.

, This will actually kill bacteria and mildew and denature odorous organic compounds. Read How to do an ozone shock treatment on a vehicle for details on what to do., There are professionals who focus specifically on removing odors, either through professional detailing outlets, or through specialist cleaning. Search online for a suitable place near you, or call a local car dealership for their advice on who to use. If they don't know, call the community police, as they may have contacts with people who do difficult cleaning jobs.


In many cases, there are commercial cleaning solutions that you can use to remove specific odors but you may need to ask for these from professional detailers or auto shops. Be prepared to give them details about the odor.







, They are much easier to remove when they first occur and will leave the least odor behind when removed fast. Also, do a regular sweep to remove food scraps, empty drink bottles, and any organic materials that have been traipsed into the car on fee, clothing, and equipment.

When traveling with pets, ensure that they are adequately cared for so that there aren't little messes. Cats can be carried in waterproof containers that will trap urine in the container rather than on the upholstery. And dogs should be toileted before entering the car and given regular toilet stops if you're on a long trip.
Always have additional floor protection. Removing rubber-backed mats to clean off mess and odor is much easier than trying to get it out of the carpet on the car. Imagine the difference between removing dog feces that has been smeared on a mat or on the carpet and you'll soon prefer to have mats down.






Place towels or throws on the areas where children sit. You know they're going to spill things, so cover it up first!
Plan for a weekly interior clean out. It'll be much faster when done regularly and odors won't have much of a chance to build up.






Leave windows wound up when you're not in the car. Animals can jump in, rain can wash in, and people can even toss litter in when windows are left down.

Take out as much stuff as possible, and either lay it to the side of your car or put it in your house.;
, Take them out and shake them properly so all the pieces of dirt and other trash do not make it into your vehicle. The best thing to do is to simply place them next to your car in a dry area., Reach under the pedals, seats and crevices around the car to pick up and dispose of all remaining dirt, crumbs and trash from the floor of your vehicle. If you leave too much trash in your car when you began to wash the carpet, you won't truly be cleaning all that much., There are a wide variety of products on the market to clean car carpets and they are all pretty similar. No matter which product you use, the method is the same. Even laundry detergent will do the trick just as well. Look for a soft-bristled brush that will help you work the shampoo into the fabric of the carpet., Spray the carpet cleaning shampoo on the surface of the carpet and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Work it in slowly and methodically with your brush. Remember to use circular motions which will best bring up dirt and grime. Repeat if necessary on problem areas with stains or large amounts of dirt., Use a wet rag and dampen the shampooed areas. Try and pull up as much of the soap as possible. Remember, you do not want to get the carpet too wet, which will cause mold underneath. As long as you are able to get most of the shampoo up from the carpet, you should be fine., This is important, as you don't want moisture to fester and not evaporate. Open all the doors to your car, and let it sit out in the sun. You should probably wait at least a few hours. Go back and feel your carpets. If they are still damp, give them another hour or so. If not, your job is all done., Take the mats out and place them on the ground; preferably cement, concrete, or blacktop. Use a standard vacuum or a shopvac to get rid of noticeable debris and dirt on the mats. Make sure to vacuum both sides. You can also give your mats a few shakes to get off any remaining dirt and grime., Turn your mats so that the plastic underside is facing upwards. Use a few drops of dish soap on the plastic. Use a water hose to agitate the debris, and ignite the soap's foaming action. Scrub with a towel or sponge. If there is stuck on dirt, feel free to use a brush. Rinse the plastic down one more time with the hose, and then dry with a towel., Turn your mats around so the fabric side is facing upwards. Purchase a carpet cleaning formula, or use laundry detergent. Spray/pour a healthy amount onto the fabric. Use a water hose, and spray the fabric with water. This will initiate the cleaning formula and dislodge any debris., Use a medium sized brush and scrub the fabric in circular motions. Some spots may require more pressure. Feel free to spray the mat with water in between scrubbing different areas of the fabric. After you are done scrubbing, rinse the fabric down again with water until all the soap bubbles are gone., Remove excess water with a vacuum. Then dry with a towel or washcloth. Press down to soak in as much excess water as possible. Finally, hang your mats on a clothes line, or at least in a spot where they can hang freely., General stains are usually brought about by water, mud, dirt, excess moisture, etc. Add together, in a bucket, the following: a gallon of hot water, a few drops of dish detergent, and a cup of white vinegar. Mix these until they form one body of liquid. Dip a rag or sponge and soak the stained area with the mixture. Then take a bristle brush, and move in circular motions against the fabric. Blot this area with paper towels., First add a healthy amount of cool water to the stain. Do not add hot water, which will cause the stain to set-in even further.

First try this in a secluded area of your car, or preferably your trunk., This can be for general stains or more set-in stains. Simply spray the glass cleaner onto the effected area. Wait about 5-10 minutes to let the cleaner act and lift the stain. Finally, wipe away with a damp washcloth and let dry., Some stains are incredibly hard to get rid of, and require extra strength. Make a paste using 3% hydrogen peroxide, and a dab of non-gel toothpaste. Lather it onto the stained carpet area. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. Then, with a rag, rub the mixture into the carpet using a swirling motion. Finally, dab with a paper towel to wipe off the excess., Mix together equal parts laundry starch and cold water into a bucket. Stir the ingredients until the paste is fairly firm. Apply the paste to the blood stain and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then scrub the mixture in with a wash cloth. You can wipe away any excess with a wet paper towel., Place one or two ice cubes over a piece of gum that is stuck to the carpeting in your car. Let it sit there for about ten minutes. This will harden the gum (freezing it). You can then use a scrape, or your hands and pry the gum off. Finally, wash the area with a damp washcloth and let dry., After your pets have been in your car long enough, your car tends to get an animal odor. Sprinkle some Borax onto the carpeted areas. Let this sit for about an hour to let the Borax act on the smell. Then, vacuum up the Borax, and wipe clean with a dry washcloth., Add together, in a bucket, equal parts cold water and meat tenderizer. Mix both together until the tenderizer has diluted. Then place on the stained area using a towel. Let the mixture sit on the stain for 30 minutes. You can then clean the area up using a damp washcloth and let the area dry."

Locate an auto detailer.,
Ask the detailer for a price quote.,
Check the detailer’s work.,
Ask the detailer about their cleaning products.,
Be ready to drop off your car.",How to Clean Car Upholstery6," A detailer will completely clean your car, cleaning the upholstery, dashboards, vents, windows and other areas. Check with family and friends to find an auto detailer, or search online for one in your area.


Make sure the detailer is certified or trained to use tools and cleaners properly. Also make sure they are insured.
Call around to get an approximate price in order to compare detailers in your area.

, Take your car down to the detailer so they can see how big of a job it will be to clean the car.


The detailer should not give you a price before they have seen your car, however.

, Before you pay and leave, check to make sure the detailer has cleaned your car to your satisfaction.If you have child car seats, make sure these have been removed and the seat underneath has been cleaned.

, Most detailers will likely use commercial cleaners and harsh chemicals to clean your car. If you prefer to stick with environmentally friendly cleaners, see if you can find a detailer who uses these kinds.


Some detailers may try to cut costs by using cheaper cleaning products, which can ultimately be damaging or not as long-lasting as other products.This may be particularly important if you have sensitivities to strong odors or chemical smells, which could potentially linger in the car.

, Detailing can take a minimum of two hours, and will likely take longer if you have several stains or an especially dirty car. Plan other errands to run in the area, or have someone pick you up so that you don’t have to wait around the detailer’s garage.

Get car seat covers.,
Apply a stain repellent to your upholstery.,
Clean spills and messes immediately.,
Limit food and drinks in the car.,
Keep your car tidy.,
Vacuum regularly.",How to Clean Car Upholstery7," Purchase seat covers that will protect your seats. These can either match your seats or they can have bright, colorful patterns on them. They are available for both bucket seats (such as front seats) and for bench seats (such as backseats), and can cost $30-$40. Many kinds can be machine-washed, making it easier to tidy up your car., A stain repellent will make it hard for stains to settle into the upholstery and will prolong the life of the upholstery. A stain repellent like Scotchgard Fabric and Upholstery Protector is available at home supply stores.


Follow the instructions on the product label for proper usage.

, Don’t allow spills and messes to sit in your car if possible. If they are not cleaned up right away, they may set into the upholstery, making it hard to remove them. Additionally, they can add to an unpleasant odor in your car.

, By banning food and drinks in the car, you can reduce the potential for many stains and messes. Accidents are sure to happen if you stop suddenly or you are trying to eat while driving. Eliminate this risk by not allowing food or drinks in the car.

, By removing garbage and other items from your vehicle after each journey, you may reduce the potential for stains to occur from grease-soaked fast food bags or spilled coffee cups. Dispose of any excess trash immediately after use so it doesn’t pile up and add to the clutter of your vehicle's interior.


Remove crayons and other things that are prone to melting if it is hot outside. The temperature of your car’s interior will be markedly hotter than outside and crayons, for example, will melt on upholstery if left there in the heat.

, Removing dirt and debris from your car will prevent them from grinding into the seats and the carpet, thereby contributing to hard-to-remove stains. Set a schedule for yourself to vacuum out your car at least once a month, or more frequently if your car gets dirty quickly.

Replace your car’s cabin air filter.,
Clear off and spray the air intake vents.,
Spray all vents with disinfectant cleaner.,
Start the engine and set the air conditioner to max.,
Have your car serviced.",How to Clean Car AC Vents2," Most newer cars have an easily replaceable air filter that you can access from inside the cabin. You should consult your vehicle’s manual for specific instructions about how to remove and replace it.In many newer models, including Hondas and Toyotas, you’ll start by lowering the glove compartment by unfixing the tabs that keep it in place.You might have to remove screws that hold a panel in place just below the glove compartment.On GM sedans, the filter is located in a casing beneath the dashboard on the driver's side.After lowering the glove compartment or removing the panel just beneath it, locate the clip that secures the air filter cover. Pinch the clip to release and remove the cover.Pull the old filter straight out of its housing and replace it with a new one.You should change your car's cabin air filter once a year.Consider changing it more frequently if you live in a dense urban area or in an environment with lots of dust., The air intakes are on the exterior of the car around the windshield cowling.Brush away dead leaves or any other accumulated debris using a broom or handheld dust brush. Spray inside the vents with a sanitizing enzymatic cleaner.Enzymatic disinfectants will help kill mold or fungi growing in your vent system, while air fresheners will just act as a perfume. Go for a cleaner labeled “mold and mildew fighting,” “disinfectant” or “antibacterial,” as these sprays will contain an enzyme.

, Close your car doors and windows. Make sure the car is off and keys are out of the ignition. Spray liberally inside all of your car’s interior vents with the enzymatic cleaner.Consult your car’s manual to make sure you’ve located all of the A/C vents.

, After you’ve sprayed all of your vents, start your car’s engine. Set both the air conditioner and fan blower to max. After about ten minutes, turn your A/C off, open all the car doors, and let the fan blow for another five minutes., If the smell persists, you might need to have your A/C serviced. For persistent moldy smell, consult your mechanic or dealership about replacing your evaporator core.Other smells, like gas or antifreeze, could indicate system leaks.Depending on if any parts need to be flushed or replaced, the cost could be between $300 and $2000 (US).

"
"
Turn the air conditioner off before reaching your destination.,
Keep the air intakes clear of leaves and other debris.,
Run the blower without the air conditioner on periodically.",How to Clean Car AC Vents3," Make it a habit to turn your air conditioner off while letting the fan blow a few minutes before you reach any destination. Try to do this about three to five minutes before turning off your engine. Letting the fan blow a few minutes after turning off the A/C will help dry your vent system, preventing mold growth., Never let anything collect around your A/C intakes. Brush away debris weekly, or more often if necessary. Leaves and other debris that accumulates around the windshield cowling are a leading cause of mold growth in the A/C vent system., Every two or three months, choose a warm, dry day to clear out your A/C vents using the fan blower. Open all the car doors, make sure the A/C is off, and turn the blower on max. Regularly drying out your vent systems using this technique will prevent future mold growth."

,Drain all the coolant from the engine and keep it to use again or dispose of it legally; no matter how little.,
Remove both of the accessory belt(s) for the alternator and power steering, etc:

The older models with two belts have lock bolts on the tensioner bolts that must be loosened before you can turn the long tensioner bolt.,

Remove the bolts holding the power steering pump by unbolting the 3 bolts to release the power steering pump bracket from the engine (12mm and 14mm), but without opening or unsealing the power steering hoses or you will need to drain it and refill it when finished.,
Loosen the long bolt of alternator pivoting bracket on the alternator belt; so it will allow the adjustable accessory to pivot as tension is released, loosen the tensioner enough to remove the belt.,Follow serpentine belt instructions in your operator manual and see their diagram for that kind of belt, if so equipped on newer models.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Mx6 1993 to 20021"," The owner/operator guide omits such repairs. The factory Mazda, OEM, repair manuals do not explain in detail for a beginner and advise use of unnecessary tools. (The tools needed will be mentioned in each step.) Check the manuals and see which of these cars used this same engine -- some up to 2004.

Caution: Use the ""smallest workable ratchet, breakover wrench and/or cheater leverage extension"" correctly to not over tighten (over torque) bolts and avoid breaking off a bolt or screw (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").
You actually might have to remove the engine to extract a broken bolt when you do the reassembly if you break off a screw or bolt in a tight spot for instance.

,

Change the timing belt, timing belt tensioner and its idler pulley.
Caution: this is an interference engine meaning that the valves and pistons will come into contact, interfere and damage or ruin the engine in case (if) the timing belt were to break or slips on cam(s) sprockets or the crankshaft sprocket (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").

,,,, You will need to loosen the lock bolts a turn or more and then loosen the tensioner a good number of turns until you can get enough slack to remove the belts.


,

This will help get some working space, where it is difficult to loosen and tighten the lock bolt on the power steering tensioner with a combination wrench (14mm) even by switching ends of the wrench. Do not pry belts off or on.

, The older models do have two flat belts (not v-belts) and the newer models probably have a single serpentine belt.

Do not pry or force the belts to get them off; you will probably need it all loosened even more to get the new tighter belts on anyway.

Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.,
Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.,Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.,
Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but ""finger-tight"" (snug).,
Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot).","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Mx6 1993 to 20022"," One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now ""found"" under that hose.
, Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.

Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.

,, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.,
With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little ""bump"" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a ""remote push-button starter switch"" or by wiggling the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.

Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor ""bump."" Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.
Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally ""bumped"" or turned away from TDC (top dead center) by the starter motor in error.

 There or two of these cam shafts.,Remove the OHC cam valve cover which is necessary to access the timing belt, the top of the timing belt sprockets, and the cam timing marks.,
Do not turn the engine using the cam timing sprockets or their retaining bolts, or by pulling on the timing belt.,
Align the timing marks on back of the cam sprockets lined up straight across, with a wrench on the retaining bolt of the harmonic pulley

Caution: with the negative terminal of the battery disconnected.,
Work on level ground and block the wheels (so they won't roll) with bricks or wooden pieces about the size of a bricks.,Loosen the right front wheel lug nuts but leave them snug (""right side"" as when you are seated in the car).,
Jack up that side of the car.,Realize that later you will support the engine separately with a jack as explained when it is needed but you may need a different jack.,
Remove the plastic splash-guard cover under the engine which extends to cover the side of the wheel well.,
Support the engine securely but with just little/slight upward pressure with a ""scissor jack"" or ""bottle jack"" with a strong piece of wood (longer than a brick) to protect the engine from the jack.,
Remove the plastic top half timing-cover which is held on by 4 small bolts (10mm), with one near each corner.,
Remove the ""harmonic pulley bolt"" (21mm) that you had loosened earlier and remove the pulley.,
Put the bolt back in to hold the sprocket on and be sure the sprocket ""key"" is always kept in its slot.,
Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).,Remove the lower timing cover carefully because you have to maneuver it to clear off of the sort of alignment pin-block (actually almost a little cube and is about 2cm) and is just above the crankshaft sprocket and fits into a place in the lower half cover but you can not see it until the cover is off.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Mx6 1993 to 20023"," Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them.

Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).




 On the right is the distributor found on older models with its cap removed to check that it is pointing toward the number one spark plug terminal to check that the timing is on the compression stroke.

Caution: the TDC could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up (""It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke.""); so then align it as explained next.
Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head.
The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (""top of the compression stroke""). Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the ""number one spark plug hole"" by a ""compression gauge"" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.
Required: securely place a ""plastic/rubber"" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably ""not real cork"" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the ""rubber stop-block."" Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will ""turn"" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two ""open-end"" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).

, Put on the parking brake.,, Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only.,, Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,"
"
Begin removing the motor mount by unbolting the 7 bracket bolts (17mm = 11/16 inch) with a strong breakover wrench with a cheater pipe on its handle to get more leverage and remove an 8th bolt which is the longer bolt that passes through the middle of the lumpy looking metal-rubber mount also.,Find the ""seventh"" bracket bolt if not yet removed which was uncovered when you lifted out the heavy lump-like middle part of the mount.,Remove the huge, oddly shaped motor mount bracket carefully from among the air conditioning hoses and power steering hoses by pulling them back ""just a little,"" and yet do not damage the wiring and hoses.,
Remove the smaller ""engine mount bracket"" of the motor mount which is heavy duty steel and is still bolted to the engine block after you have removed the rest that was mounted to the fender area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Mx6 1993 to 20024","

Caution: Be sure to also support the engine with a jack just putting a little pressure upward so you can prepare to remove the motor mount on the belt end of the engine.

,,, You'll need the 17mm socket and a 3/8 inch ratchet with smaller cheater extension to loosen the bolt. 1/2 inch ratchet is hard to use between things in the tight areas. It is rather awkward to do."
"Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""counter-clockwise"" with an Allen ""el-shaped"" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.,Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""clockwise"" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.,Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).,Remove the ""idler"" pulley of the timing belt system (14mm).,
Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA).,Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal without gouging or roughing the metal.,

 Keeping the stop block in place to hold the sprockets aligned, Start the belt part way onto the ""crankshaft pulley sprocket"" and going counter-clockwise being certain to place the belt without slack onto the left of the idler pulley and across the tops of the ""cam sprockets"" and use the Allen Wrench to rotate the tensioner toward counterclockwise to get the belt on to the right of the tensioner, and work the belt the rest of the way onto the sprockets and both pulleys.,
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide on to the sprockets.,With the Allen wrench in the hole in tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.,
Remove the ""stopper block"" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Mx6 1993 to 20025",",,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its left of the correct one) and find and then loosen the water pump. Loosen it from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet hammer but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.,, Tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, ie: breaking one off. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with ""gasket cement."" Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.

Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage ways in the engine or radiator.

, Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley,,,

Put on the ""new timing belt""; follow instructions that came with it. (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench can be used to budge the cam slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper ""jammed"" (in to hold the sprockets) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on right. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them., While holding that hex wrench begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way.,,

Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.

Change the timing belt, timing belt tensioner and its idler pulley. The diagram shows the following numbered parts: (1) retaining bolt for the harmonic pulley, (2) a large thin washer (the guard for the crankshaft opening) found behind the harmonic pulley (harmonic pulley not shown), (3) both halves of the timing covers, the belt (sort of tee-shaped, not numbered), and (4) the tube for the oil-dipstick (its retained by top left bolt of upper-half, timing-cover).
Caution: this is an interference engine meaning that the valves and pistons will come into contact, interfere and may damage the engine in case (if) the timing belt were to break or slip on cam(s) sprockets or the crankshaft sprocket (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").

,,,, You will need to loosen the lock bolts a turn or more and then loosen the tensioner a good number of turns until you can get enough slack to remove the belts.

, This will help get some working space, where it is difficult to loosen and tighten the lock bolt on the power steering tensioner with a combination wrench (14mm) even by switching ends of the wrench. Do not pry belts off or on.

, Loosen the tensioner enough to remove the belt. The older models have two flat belts (not v-belts) and newer models probably have a single serpentine belt.


Do not pry or force the belts to get them off. loosen the adjustment bolts more than you expect - new belts will be much tighter than broken in ones. By prying off belts, you risk damage to various parts with no saved time or effort.

Obtain a manual, and check and it should have torquing instructions for bolts and compare their instructions to this and follow any recommendations about removal, installation and replacement instructions, pictures and diagrams that may be helpful.,
Caution: Use the ""smallest workable ratchet, breakover wrench and/or cheater leverage extension"" correctly to not over tighten (over torque) bolts and avoid breaking off a bolt or screw (more detail in the ""Warnings Section"").,
Avoid engine damage from the timing belt breaking or slipping, or the tensioner pulley or idler pulley locking up (seizing) or the timing belt skipping one or more cogs on a sprocket causing valve timing problems and possibly breaking valves, pistons and/or the engine cylinder (block):

Understand the numbering of the cylinders and label the spark plug cables and cylinders 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right but the other end is not that easy and carefully pry and get the cables off their spark plugs.

,
Check your manual for firing order which will be 1, 3, 4, 2 or such for 1993--1997 (verify this carefully) and 1, 4, 3, 2 or such for after 1998 for how they plug onto the coil pack or distributor on older models.Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal so your engine can not be accidentally turned or started in error, you must remove the spark plugs before doing dangerous work.

,
Drain all the coolant from the engine and keep it to use again or dispose of it legally; no matter how little.

,
Remove both of the accessory belt(s) for the alternator and power steering, etc:


The older models with two belts have lock bolts on the tensioner bolts that must be loosened before you can turn the long tensioner bolt.,
Remove the bolts holding the power steering pump by unbolting the 3 bolts to release the power steering pump bracket from the engine (12mm and 14mm), but without opening or unsealing the power steering hoses or you will need to drain it and refill it when finished.,
Loosen the long bolt of alternator pivoting bracket on the alternator belt; so it will allow the adjustable accessory to pivot as tension is released, loosen the tensioner enough to remove the belt.,
Follow serpentine belt instructions in your operator manual and see their diagram for that kind of belt, if so equipped on newer models.

","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20041"," The owner/operator guide omits such repairs.

Remove two short 10mm bolts holding the power steering hose where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way.,
Remove spark plugs - use a specialized spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside which helps to lift plugs from the deep ports.,
Once the plugs are out, prevent any objects from passing down the spark plug ports and into the cylinders.,
Loosen the harmonic pulley retainer bolt (21mm) but keep it ""finger-tight"" (snug - do not remove it at this time).,
In a pinch, consider using the power of the starter motor and power ""bump method"" to loosen the pulley bolt.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda 626 1993 to 20022"," One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered, but is now reachable by moving the power steering hose.;
, If you do not have a spark plug socket, a magnetic pickup probe will extract them.


If you intend to reuse the spark plugs, be careful in their extraction. Careful examination of the plugs may indicate the condition of your engine - repair manuals usually have a chart explaining what conditions of used spark plugs indicate.

, Foreign objects could cause very serious damage to the engine. An easy way to prevent debris from entering is to insert paper towels in the spark plug wells.

, Ideally, use a small impact wrench to loosen it.

, This bump method should only be performed with the spark plugs removed and NEVER while holding the wrench by hand or foot.
To ""bump"" the bolt loose, reconnect the battery, perform a momentary press of a ""remote push-button starter switch"". If none is available, wiggle the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount while a longer handled socket wrench is lodged onto the bolt as explained below (never held by hand or foot).


Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. Position a break-over wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in with heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out. Alternatively, secure the breaker bar by positioning it below the tie bar secured to the tie bar with a screw clamp. Make sure it is tightly secured so it will not move. This method does not require any blocking in of the cheater bar.Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So quiet the area so you can hear any sounds.
Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal after this technique so your engine cannot be accidentally turned away from top dead center (TDC) by the starter motor, potentially damaging various engine parts.

Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the Overhead Cam (OHC) valve cover to the engine.,
Remove the OHC valve cover.,
Align the timing marks on back of the cam sprockets lined up straight across.,
Check that the cylinder one is at Top Dead Center (TDC) on the compression stroke.,
Required: securely place a ""rubber"" stop-block (you may use a rubber stopper from a wine bottle but not made of real cork which will crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets.,
Loosen the front wheel lug nuts on the right-hand side of the car, but leave them snug (the same side the engine belts and pulleys are on).

,
Jack up the that side and use a jack-stand to support the car (place jack and stand on strong concrete or stone base).,
Keep in mind that later you will need to support the engine with a jack; so you may need an additional jack.

,
Remove the plastic splash-guard cover under the engine which extends to cover the side of the wheel well.,
Support the engine securely with a scissor or bottle jack exerting only a little upward pressure with a strong piece of wood (longer than a brick) to protect the engine from the jack.,
Remove the plastic top half timing cover by loosening 4 small bolts (10mm) near each corner.,
Remove the harmonic pulley bolt (21mm) that you loosened earlier and remove the pulley.,
Put the bolt back in to hold the sprocket on and ensure the sprocket key is always kept in its slot.,
Remove the retaining screws from the lower half timing cover (10mm).,
Remove the lower timing cover carefully - you have to maneuver it to clear the alignment pin-block (shaped like a small 2mm cube) just above the crankshaft sprocket that fits into place in the lower half cover.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda 626 1993 to 20023"," Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one is on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are on the cover (one of these is about 3 times longer and was previously covered by the power steering hose removed earlier). The one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Only when all are loosened should you finish removing all 11. If you do more than just break each of them free first, it can cause much difficulty in removal of all (and potentially damage the screw taps or worse).

,


WARNING: Do not turn the engine using the cam timing sprockets, or by their retaining bolts, or by pulling on the timing belt. The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and no cylinder compression resists your effort.

, (Caution: be sure the negative terminal of the battery is disconnected - if you used the bump technique earlier, you may have forgotten to detach it again). With a wrench on the retaining bolt of the harmonic pulley aligned with the top of the engine head - at the same time line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).

,


Caution: the TDC marks can be 180 degrees off even though the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is pointing straight up (when it's at the top of the exhaust stroke).
Caution: check that timing is at TDC of the compression stroke - find the marks on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. Older models have a distributor - remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at terminal number one when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor, turn the crankshaft slowly 360 degrees to bring it to TDC (at the top of the compression stroke of cylinder 1).
Newer engines are 'distributorless', still the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the ""number one spark plug hole"" by a ""compression gauge"" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke (which also comes to TDC, in all 4 stroke engines).

, Place the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will turn in opposite directions about two notches off TDC -- pushed by the valve springs pressure on the cam lobes.

,, Do not depend on the jack to support your vehicle. You will only be removing the wheel adjacent/next to the pulleys.

,, Watch your head.

, The best place to support is the massive air conditioner bracket on older models. The engine support is necessary to remove the motor mount between the halves of the timing-cover which prevents access to the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump. This removal will happen in a later step, block it up now.

, The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension.

, You can wiggle the pulley while gently prying and pull it off the crankshaft. If it will not remove, you may need to use a steering wheel puller or gear puller.

, This is necessary to remove the lower timing cover.

, One is difficult to see in the middle of the cover, just below the motor mount.

, You cannot see it until the cover is off.

"
Caution, be sure you support the engine with a jack with just a little pressure upward so you can remove the motor mount on the belt end of the engine.

,
Begin removing the motor mount by unbolting the 7 bracket bolts (17mm = 11/16 inch) with a strong break-over wrench with a cheater pipe on its handle to get more leverage and remove an 8th bolt which is the longer bolt that passes through the middle of the lumpy looking metal-rubber mount also.

,
Find the ""seventh"" bracket bolt if not yet removed which was uncovered when you lifted out the heavy lump-like middle part of the mount.

,
Remove the huge, oddly shaped motor mount bracket carefully from among the air conditioning hoses and power steering hoses by pulling them back ""just a little,"" and yet do not damage the wiring and hoses.

,
Remove the smaller ""engine mount bracket"" of the motor mount which is heavy duty steel and is still bolted to the engine block after you have removed the rest that was mounted to the fender area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda 626 1993 to 20024",",,,, You'll need the 17mm socket and a 3/8 inch ratchet with smaller cheater extension to loosen the bolt. 1/2 inch ratchet is hard to use between things in the tight areas. It is rather awkward to do.

"
"
Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt-tensioner pulley toward ""counter-clockwise"" with an Allen ""el-shaped"" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.

,
Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""clockwise"" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring, and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.

,
Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).

,
Remove the ""idler"" pulley of the timing belt system by one bolt in the middle (14mm).

,
Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA).,
Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal but not gouging or roughing the metal.,
Put on the ""new water pump""; follow instructions that came with it.,
Install the ""new timing tensioner"" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely.,
Install the new ""idler pulley"" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.

,
Put on the ""new timing belt""; follow instructions that came with it.,
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way enough, using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide onto the sprockets.,
With the Allen wrench in the hole in the tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.

,
Remove the ""stopper block"" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda 626 1993 to 20025",",,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its to the left of the correct one). Then loosen the pump from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet/hammer, but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.

, If your water pump used a metal gasket and it is still secure to the engine and in good shape, do not remove it. Just clean it up and mount your new water pump to it. The metal gasket is better than any new fiber gasket that might have come with your new pump.

, To tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, breaking one off: Start the bolts by hand; first just barely snug them, then gradually tighten them evenly, in two for three passes, in a star pattern, back and forth across, from side-to-side to minimize any possible warping. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with ""gasket cement."" Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.


Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker, then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage-ways in the engine or radiator.

, Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley. Be sure the spring is hooked into the groove on the engine pin.

,, (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench on special hex-part of cam along the middle length of the cam can be used to budge the cam just slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper ""jammed"" in (to hold the sprockets/cams) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on correctly. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them.

, While holding that hex wrench, begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way.

,,


Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around, using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it is not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.

Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.,
Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.,
Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.

,
Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but ""finger-tight"" (snug).,
Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot).","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20042"," One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now ""found"" under that hose.;
, Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.


Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.

,, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.

,
With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little ""bump"" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a ""remote push-button starter switch"" or by wiggling the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor.

Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally ""bumped"" or turned away from TDC by the starter motor in error.

Obtain a manual, and check and it should have torquing instructions for bolts and compare their instructions to this and follow any recommendations about removal, installation and replacement instructions, pictures and diagrams that may be helpful.,

Avoid engine damage from the timing belt breaking or slipping, or the tensioner pulley or idler pulley locking up (seizing) or the timing belt skipping one or more cogs on a sprocket causing valve timing problems and possibly breaking valves, pistons and/or the engine cylinder (block):

,, You will need to loosen the lock bolts a turn or more and then loosen the tensioner a good number of turns until you can get enough slack to remove the belts.

, This will help get some working space, where it is difficult to loosen and tighten the lock bolt on the power steering tensioner with a combination wrench (14mm) even by switching ends of the wrench. Do not pry belts off or on., The older models do have two flat belts (not v-belts) and the newer models probably have a single serpentine belt.

Do not pry or force the belts to get them off; you will probably need it all loosened even more to get the new tighter belts on anyway.

"
Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""counter-clockwise"" with an Allen ""el-shaped"" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.

,
Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""clockwise"" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.

,
Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).

,
Remove the ""idler"" pulley of the timing belt system (14mm).

,
Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA).,
Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal without gouging or roughing the metal.

,
Put on the ""new water pump""; follow instructions that came with it.,
Install the ""new timing tensioner"" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely.,
Install the new ""idler pulley"" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.

,
Put on the ""new timing belt""; follow instructions that came with it.,
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide on to the sprockets.,
With the Allen wrench in the hole in tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.

Remove the ""stopper block"" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Mazda Protege 2001 to 20045",",,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its left of the correct one) and find and then loosen the water pump. Loosen it from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet hammer but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt.

,, Tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, ie: breaking one off. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with ""gasket cement."" Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.


Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage ways in the engine or radiator.

, Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley.

,, (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench can be used to budge the cam slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the the stopper ""jammed"" (in to hold the sprockets) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on right. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them.

, While holding that hex wrench begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way.

,,


Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.

Reconnect the battery.",How to Put on an Alternator Belt," In older model vehicles, engines often came equipped with multiple belts that each powered a different accessory. However, most modern vehicles use only one belt to power the alternator as well as the power steering, air conditioning, and any other accessories. Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, this belt (often called the serpentine belt) is often located on the front or side of the engine.Many American made vehicles with V6 engines or larger have the serpentine or accessory belts on the front. These engines are considered “longitudinally mounted,” with the engine mounted lengthwise on the chassis.
Many four cylinder vehicles have transverse mounted engines, meaning the engine is mounted at a ninety degree angle from the chassis, placing the belts on the side of the engine bay instead of the front.;
, A significant sign that your alternator or serpentine belt needs replacing is visible cracking along the belt. Modern serpentine belts are designed to prevent cracking and will last much longer than older accessory style belts, but all belts are prone to cracking over a long enough timeline.If the belt appears dried out and cracks have formed, it will need to be replaced.
Use a flashlight to get a good look at the belt in areas that aren’t as visible to look for signs of cracking elsewhere on the belt.

, While cracks are the most common sign of a worn out belt, there are other common signs of damage that you should be on the lookout for. Look for chunks of the belt missing in places, frayed fabric along the back of the belt, or signs that the belt has been rubbing on something.You may want to start the engine to watch the belt moving to look for signs of damage along the entire belt.
If something has been rubbing on the belt, you will need to identify it and move it before installing your new belt.

, Even with no visible signs of damage, your alternator or serpentine belt may still be too worn. You can purchase an inexpensive plastic belt gauge at most auto parts stores than can tell you if your belt needs to be replaced by measuring the depth of the grooves on the belt. Simply slide the gauge into one of the grooves and take note of how far it goes in.If the plastic gauge seats into the belt far enough for the handle to make contact with the belt, it is too worn and will need to be replaced.
You can do this test with the belt on or off of the vehicle.

, Instead of purchasing a belt depth gauge, you can purchase and download a smartphone application that can tell you if your belt needs to be replaced. Applications like PIC gauge and Gates Programs Belt Wear allow you to simply take a picture of the belt threads to have the application analyze their depth. If it deems the depth to be too shallow, it will tell you to replace the belt.There are applications for both iPhone and Android smartphones that can measure the depth of the tread on your belts.
It’s important to remember that the application is not an expert opinion and may not always provide accurate information.

, Any time you work on your vehicle you should start by putting on the necessary safety equipment. Eye protection will prevent dust, fluids or debris from falling into your eyes if you have to get under the vehicle. Gloves can also provide protection against scratches, pinches and cuts that may result in working in your engine bay if you choose to wear them.Always wear eye protection when working on your vehicle.
Gloves can protect your hands, but are optional for this project.

, Open the hood of your car and locate the battery. It’s important to note that some vehicles keep the battery in the trunk instead of the engine bay for space saving or weight distribution. Once you’ve located it, use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the bolt holding the ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery. The negative terminal can be identified by looking for the negative symbol (-) or the letters NEG. Loosen the bolt until you can slide the cable off of the terminal.Tuck the cable to the side of the battery to prevent it from coming in contact with the negative terminal.
This will ensure the engine cannot be started while you’re working on it, protecting you and the engine from damage.

, Many newer model vehicles come equipped with an auto-tensioner pulley. The pulley presses upward as the belt wraps around it so the belt remains under constant, steady tension. Use a half inch drive breaker bar or socket wrench, and slide the portion of the wrench that would normally go into a socket into the square opening in the center of the pulley. It is possible that your vehicle uses a 3/8 inch drive or even a bolt on the tensioner pulley, so refer to your particular vehicle’s service manual to ensure you have the appropriate tools. Rotate the wrench clockwise to relieve the pressure it is placing on the belt. It may take a good amount of pressure to rotate the tensioner pulley down. Be careful to release it slowly with steady pressure to avoid injuring yourself or damaging the vehicle.
As soon as you let the tensioner go, it will return to its usual position and put pressure on the belt again, so you will need to hold it in place as you remove the belt.
Not all vehicles are equipped with an auto-tensioner. Consult your specific vehicle’s service manual to see if yours is.

, If your vehicle does not have an auto-tensioner, you can still relieve the tension on the belt by loosening the bolts attaching the alternator to the engine. As you loosen the bolts, tilt the alternator forward to create slack in the belt. Be careful not to damage the threads of the alternator bolts by allowing it to sit tilted under pressure for too long.If your vehicle has an alternator belt instead of a serpentine belt, this is the method you will need to use.
Be careful not to damage the wiring going into the alternator. The alternator provides the power the engine needs to run through those wires.

, Once the tension is off the belt, slide it off of the first or highest pulley. Once it is off of one pulley, you can release the auto-tensioner if that is the method you used to reduce the tension. Make a note of how the belt is wound throughout the different pulleys if it is a serpentine belt, as you will need to slide the new belt on in the same way.If you do not have a diagram on the vehicle or in your service manual laying out the direction your serpentine belt travels through the pulleys, take a picture of it with your phone to refer to when installing the new belt.
A strictly alternator belt will likely only go around an alternator pulley and the crank pulley at the bottom of the engine.

, Before you begin installing the new belt, compare it to the old one to ensure it is the proper length and width. Different vehicles have different sized belts and installing the wrong size could result in failing to power the accessories or even damage to the engine. If your old belt was loose because it had stretched over time, take that into consideration when comparing the two belts.
Make sure both belts have the same number of “ribs” or threads spanning the width of the belt.

, Using a diagram or the picture you took to guide you, snake the new belt around all the necessary accessory pulleys except the auto-tensioner or alternator (depending on whether or not your vehicle came equipped with an auto-tensioner). With many serpentine belts, this can be difficult, as some pulleys will be hard to access with your hands, so be patient and make sure to seat the belt properly around each.You will need to keep tension on the belt with your hands as you slide it into place to ensure it doesn’t fall off while you’re looping it around pulleys.
If your vehicle has a belt only for the alternator, you will need to only slide it around the crank pulley at the bottom of the engine.

, If your vehicle is equipped with an auto-tensioner, use a breaker bar or appropriately sized ratchet to lower the auto-tensioner pulley last. With the belt around all of the other pulleys, slide it over the tensioner pulley with pressure still on the breaker bar or wrench. Once the belt is in place, slowly reduce the pressure on the wrench, allowing the tensioner pulley to tighten the belt.Do not simply release the auto-tensioner, as that could damage the belt and cause injury. Instead, reduce the pressure you place on it slowly.
Remove the wrench or breaker bar from the tensioner pulley once this is done.

, If you loosened the alternator to remove the old belt, reverse that process by sliding the belt back over the alternator pulley. Again, take care not to place too much pressure on the loosened bolts of the alternator. If the belt is too taught to slide it over the pulley, loosen the bolts a bit more to allow the alternator to tip forward further.Try not to remove the bolts to the alternator completely, as they will be difficult to reinstall under the pressure of the belt.
Make sure the belt seats on the alternator pulley completely.

, With the serpentine or alternator belt safely seated on the alternator pulley, use the same wrench you used to loosen to the bolts to tighten them again. As you tighten the bolts, the alternator will stop tipping forward, which will increase the tension on the belt.Don’t tighten one bolt completely before moving to the next one. Instead tighten one halfway, then the other, before coming back to the first.
If the belt seems to be putting too much pressure on the alternator, check again to make sure you have it run through all the other pulleys properly.

, Once you have released the auto-tensioner or tightened the alternator bolts, check the tension of the belt to make sure it has seated properly on all pulleys. Pinch the belt between your thumb and index finger and try to wiggle it. There should be very little give to a properly installed alternator or serpentine belt.You can purchase belt tension testers at many auto parts stores that will tell you for certain that the tension in your belt is sufficient.
If the belt feels loose, check to make sure it has been run through all of the necessary pulleys properly.

, Once the belt is securely in place, slide the ground cable back onto the negative terminal on the battery. Use the same wrench you used to remove it to tighten the bolt, then wiggle the connection with your fingers to ensure it is not loose.Make sure the ground cable is tight and won’t come off while driving.
A loose or disconnected ground cable could cause the engine to die.

Remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use Torx/Star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.,
Remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.,Prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.,
Loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but ""finger-tight"" (snug).,
Consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot).,
Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor ""bump.""","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Ford Probe 1993 to 19972"," One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now ""found"" under that hose.
, Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.

Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.

,, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.,
With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little ""bump"" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a ""remote push-button starter switch"" or by wiggling the ignition switch to ""nudge and thump"" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.

Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.

, Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little ""zinging/whizzing"" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.

Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally ""bumped"" or turned away from TDC by the starter motor in error.

Barely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).






Caution: the TDC (top dead center) could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up (""It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke.""); so then align it as explained next.
Caution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (""top of the compression stroke""). Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the ""number one spark plug hole"" by a ""compression gauge"" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.
Required: securely place a ""plastic/rubber"" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably ""not real cork"" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the ""rubber stop-block."" Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will ""turn"" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two ""open-end"" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).

"Readying to remove the timing belt, you need to turn the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""counter-clockwise"" with an Allen ""L-shaped"" hex tool that fits in a hole in the pulley to rotate it to be able to slip the belt off little by little.,Turn (pivot) the timing belt tensioner pulley toward ""clockwise"" with the Allen hex wrench enough to take the tension off of the timing belt tensioner spring and then remove the spring with very long-nose-pliers.,Remove the tensioner pulley by one bolt in the middle (14mm).,Remove the ""idler"" pulley of the timing belt system (14mm).,
Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- (12mm) socket -- and a medium size ratchet (called 3/8 inch drive in the USA).,Clean the engine block surface carefully where the water pump gasket will make contact for sealing well -- so carefully scrape off any pieces of stuck-on old gasket material corrosion, rust, or dirt to bare metal without gouging or roughing the metal.,
Put on the ""new water pump""; follow instructions that came with it.,
Install the ""new timing tensioner"" pulley and tighten its mounting bolt securely.,Install the new ""idler pulley"" and tighten the mounting bolt securely.,



 Keeping the stop block in place to hold the sprockets aligned, Start the belt part way onto the ""crankshaft pulley sprocket"" and going counter-clockwise being certain to place the belt without slack onto the left of the idler pulley and across the tops of the ""cam sprockets"" and use the Allen Wrench to rotate the tensioner toward counterclockwise to get the belt on to the right of the tensioner, and work the belt the rest of the way onto the sprockets and both pulleys.,
Press the timing belt onto place while keeping the tensioner pulley out of the way using the Allen hex wrench toward counterclockwise for the pulley to be as far backed off as possible to allow the belt to slide on to the sprockets.,With the Allen wrench in the hole in tensioner pulley for that purpose press it toward clockwise against the belt and press it in for a little tightening of the belt, and then release it slowly for the spring to bring it back into position.,
Remove the ""stopper block"" from the cams -- before you put on the top half-cover on the timing belt area.","How to Change the Timing Belt on a 2.0L, 4 Cylinder Ford Probe 1993 to 19975",",,,, Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its left of the correct one) and find and then loosen the water pump. Loosen it from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet hammer but if it does not come loose pretty easily --check again for another bolt.,, Tighten 12mm bolts securely without over-tightening, ie: breaking one off. Seal the new gasket only onto the new pump with ""gasket cement."" Do not cement it onto the block. Put anti-seize grease on bolts. You can put an even coating of marine grease on the gasket after it is cemented onto the pump so it will not stick to the engine block.

Or if you prefer to use a silicone gasket maker then apply a small even bead but not an excessive amount that could squeeze out and cause plugging/blockage of coolant passage ways in the engine or radiator.

, Hook the new spring in the hole of the tensioner ear/tab and use the Allen wrench in the hole that is in the front surface of the tensioner pulley for that wrench to bring the spring clockwise to get the spring near and then hooked onto the pin that protrudes from the engine block just above the pulley,,,

Put on the ""new timing belt""; follow instructions that came with it. (Like a 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) open end wrench can be used to budge the cam slightly to get a cam timing mark back aligned while keeping the stopper ""jammed"" (in to hold the sprockets) in place until you get the belt on and the tension spring on right. So, starting at the crankshaft sprocket place the belt a little more than halfway onto the sprocket and then going counter-clockwise making sure the belt is tightly against the idler pulley/roller as you slip the belt onto the cam sprockets and tight across between the cam sprockets when on both of them., While holding that hex wrench begin to work the belt in steps farther onto each sprocket until it is on all the way.,,

Hand rotate the crankshaft two times around using a wrench on the crankshaft sprocket bolt, then check to see that when the crankshaft key is aligned, then the two cam timing marks are still aligned as described earlier. Be sure one or both isn't off by one notch or something. If it not aligned properly then remove the belt, carefully realign all 3 marks and reinstall the belt, and double-check it again.

Troubleshoot any problems.",How to Change an Automotive Belt," This will make it easier to work under the hood. You can also use a drop light or other supplemental lighting if you deem it necessary.;
, Most belts will be found on the side of the engine block. Serpentine belts are easily identified because they weave through several pulleys. V-belts are looped around two pulleys and there are two or more belts overlapping at a point, forming a V-shape. You should replace the belt:


if it is frayed or tearing.
if it has cracks or missing chunks.
if the belt has coolant or oil on it.
These conditions make the belt incapable of properly running its components, which can lead to major problems for your engine. If for any reason you cannot locate an accessory belt or gain easy access to it then you should take your vehicle to professional., This can usually be found posted underneath the hood of your car or in your service manual for serpentine belts (S-belts).If you drive a much older car, you may have a multi-belt design (V-belt). Either way, if you cannot find a routing diagram you should take a picture or draw one before removing the belt(s).


Be sure to make note of whether the grooved side or flat side of the belt makes contact with each pulley. It is important not to put the new belt on backwards.

, There are a few things to remember when releasing tension on a belt.


For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner.
The tensioner is just another pulley that the belt runs over, but only serves to keep tension on the belt and does not power any accessories.
Some tensioners can be compressed by turning them with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. Usually twisting the pulley clockwise will compress the spring.
V-belts do not have an automatic tensioner. They can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension.
To loosen a pulley, turn it with a wrench or specialized tool. By convention, counter-clockwise will loosen the pulley.

, Once tension is released, the belt should slide off of the other pulleys easily.

, One reason for a damaged belt is a malfunctioning pulley. You should check the tensioner and all pulleys that the belt contacts. If one wobbles or does not spin freely then you may need to replace it., Since these belts need to fit exactly right, the new belt should be the same length and width as the original. The only difference should be general wear on the old belt. The best way to insure a perfect match is to compare part numbers.

, You should use your routing diagram from above to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt.When you are done, the belt should weave through the pulleys contacting each pulley only once.

, You want to make sure that your belt has the proper amount of tension on it.


For serpentine belts use the same tool you used above to compress the tensioner and turn it in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise) until the spring releases.
If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. #*Find the middle of the belt's longest stretch.
Move that point from side to side and the belt should have 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of movement in either direction. Any less and the belt is too tight, any more and it is too loose.Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic.

, Does it match the routing diagram exactly and look like the belt you took off? If the belt does not fit properly or is not installed correctly it could damage several important components of your car such as the water pump, alternator, etc.

, If possible it is best to have a friend start your car while you watch the belt. You want to be sure that it is running smoothly with no squealing or slipping. Be careful to keep your hair and clothing away from any moving parts under the hood of your vehicle.

, If you notice anything wrong such as slack in the belt or squealing, consult your routing diagram again. You may need to re-run the belt or make sure that it is properly tensioned. You should also check again to be sure all accessory pulleys are turning freely, including the tensioner. If you cannot diagnose the problem you should take your vehicle to a professional.

Most vehicles require rubber timing belts, as opposed to older steel timing chains. Available for a few dollars at any auto parts store, you'll likely need to change yours every 90,000 to 120,000 miles (140,000 to 190,000 km), depending on your engine.;
, You will need to know the make, model, and year model of the vehicle, as well as the engine type and size. Some models may have variations even during one model year, so your VIN may also be helpful. You can purchase a new belt at a dealer or an auto parts store.

, Your parts supplier should be able to tell you what you will need. Timing belt kits are also available that include replacement gaskets and other necessary materials to complete the job., Ensure you have your radio security code (if equipped) any preset radio stations on a piece of paper to allow for quick resetting once repairs are made.

, Depending on your model, you may need to remove the serpentine belt to get to the timing belt. Loosen the nuts, pushing the alternator if necessary to create slack on the belt and remove it., Do not remove pressurized fittings from the air conditioning compressor, most can be unbolted and pushed out of the way without discharging the system. Remove valve cover assembly as required for access to timing belt.

, You may need to pry apart the retaining clips to free the distributor cap, as well as remove any screws holding the cap in place.Some modern cars with electronic ignitions don't have distributors. They will have a cam and crankshaft position sensor instead. The important thing is to be able to determine Top Dead Center (TDC) on the first cylinder. Consult the engine repair manual, since these will differ by model.

, Using a wrench or socket on the crankshaft bolt rotate the engine until the timing mark on the crankshaft pulley is aligned with the 0° mark on the timing scale.


Verify the distributor rotor is aligned with the index mark on the distributor housing indicating the rotor is in position to fire the number one cylinder. If not, rotate the engine another full turn.
Don't do this on interference engines unless you're sure the belt is still intact. If you have not already bent your valves with a broken timing belt, you will likely do so if you spin the crankshaft without the camshaft spinning.

, Often, the cover saddles over the end of the crankshaft, and this pulley will not allow you to remove the cover without first removing it. Note that an additional seal will be needed to reinstall it if this is the case and special crankshaft pulley and gear removal alignment tools may be needed.

, Remove this cover off the engine. Some engines have a two-piece timing cover. Remove any components or accessory drive belts that interfere with removing the timing belt cover. This varies by model; consult your service manual to determine which parts need to be removed from your vehicle.

, Many engines have a dot or index line on the pulleys and/or sprockets that must be lined up with corresponding marks on the block, cylinder head, or accessory shaft. On some engines, the index mark on the camshaft sprocket aligns with the parting line of the first camshaft-bearing tower.


This is very important if you're replacing a timing belt that has broken. Consult your service manual for the correct alignment procedure for your vehicle and correct any misalignment before installing the new timing belt. These marks may also be displayed on a label on the timing belt cover on some engines.

, Look around the camshaft and crankshaft seals, as well as the valve cover and oil pan. Check for coolant leaks from the water pump and water pump by-pass hose. Leaks should be repaired before the new belt is installed.

, Do not remove the tensioner completely unless replacing it. Instead, pivot the spring-loaded tensioner away from the belt and then retighten the mounting bolt(s) to hold the tensioner in the loose position.

, Spin the tensioner pulley and listen for a rattle or humming noise that would indicate loose or worn bearings. Uneven wear at the rear of the old timing belt could indicate a misalignment between the tension pulley and timing belt due to worn bearings.


If any indications of damage or worn bearings are found, replace the tensioner pulley. The permanently lubricated tensioner pulley bearing can become dry, worn, loose, broken or can freeze up, so the best practice is to replace it, if it's not new.

, With the tension on the timing belt relieved, the belt should slide easily off the sprockets. Timing belts that have been used for a long time may stick in the pulley grooves and require some gentle prying with a screwdriver to release. Inspect the timing belt pulleys and water pump for any need to replace before proceeding to install the new belt.

, Torque the timing belt to the proper specifications, paying special attention to ""torquing"" specs on the engine manual, particularly the crankshaft pulley mounting bolt which usually has a very high torque spec.


If equipped with a hydraulic timing belt tensioner, removal may be required to compress the piston back into the cylinder after a ratchet is released. Place into a vise and compress until holes line up to allow the insertion of a holding pin. Once the pin is in place, the tensioner can be re-installed when the belt is installed with the pin pulled to allow the tensioner to place tension onto the timing belt.

Know that you are usually saving grams, not pounds.",How to Make a Bicycle Lighter1," The frame is the base of the bike, and the most expensive part you can buy. Getting a new frame usually means buying a brand new bike -- unless you have amazing brakes, pedals, gears, and handlebars on your old bike, it is rarely cost effective to buy a new frame and transfer everything over. When shopping for frames, there is a definite hierarchy in frame weight.



Carbon-fiber: The gold standard for light-weight bikes, carbon fiber is unfortunately a bit brittle. You will quite often see it on mountain bikes as the technology has progressed over the years so be careful if you decide to buy a second hand carbon bike. Racing, triathlon, and high-end road bikes are almost exclusively carbon fiber.

Titanium: Stronger as steel but much lighter, titanium is another high-end option often found on mountain and road bikes.

Aluminum: Strong and light, aluminum frames are the most common frames you can buy for any bike.

Steel: Sturdy but heavy, steel is most common on old bikes, which are less concerned with lower weights.;
, Perhaps the best ""bang for you buck"" fix is to get lighter wheels. You will not only lose weight, you'll become remarkably more aerodynamic. Lower spoke-count wheels and wheels made of lighter material will all help lighten your bike. What constitutes an ""upgrade"" depends on what you currently have, however, generally speaking, you can't go wrong with a few sure-fire light fixes:


Carbon-fiber wheels
Tubular wheels, not recommended for anything other than racing as they require special tires that are difficult to install and replace.
Aero wheels, Mountain bike tires, which are big and knobby, are going to kill you going up a paved hill. If you find yourself riding more roads than trails, purchase a set of commuter or ""cross"" tires, which are lighter, offer less friction, and can still accommodate light trails riding. Slicks are also a viable choice for light trails such as footpaths.

, Look at your chain rings, which are the big metal gears next to your right pedal. If you have three, you should consider purchasing a ""compact crank,"" which gives you two chain rings. While you'll have less gears to work with, you will loose weight.


If still want to keep the gears but lose the weight, you might compromise with an extra gear in the back, known as your cassette. That said, many riders find that, after 1-2 weeks of riding a compact crank, they forget they ever had a third ring.

, Carbon fiber bars or specialty aerodynamic bars, like triathlon bars, will shave off weight and dampen some of the vibrations around your hands on bumpy roads. Remember, however, that carbon fiber is somewhat brittle so if you crash, be sure to get it checked at your local bike shop., There are a lot of additions people put on their bike that, unfortunately, do nothing but add weight. Get rid of any unnecessary saddlebags, lights, fenders, mudflaps, pumps, decorations, and reflectors, especially if you are riding on a dry day outside of a city.If you're going on a short ride, drop any extra water bottle cages, though you should always have at least one water bottle present unless water will be provided by the race.
These will only shave a few grams off your total weight -- hardly worth it if you remove a bike light that will protect you on busy roads.

, While this is mostly for racers, lighter, shoes and aero helmets cut down weight keep you quick, and look professional. They can get expensive, however. You can also swap out your pedals for racing pedals and wear light-weight shoes that attach to them.

, Not for the faint of heart, race trimming involves shaving off every possible gram of weight you can. Professional rider Jack Pullar is perhaps the most extreme example, as he ripped off the seat covering and drilled holes out of his saddle, then sawed off the bottoms of his handlebars, to loose weight. While you should be careful, some race modifications include:


Sawing off your seat post 1-2 inches below where you have it set.
Trimming the ends of all your cables and cable housings.
Removing water cages and bolts., Unless you're willing to shell out $15,000 for a high-end, pristine 11lb bike, you're not going to be losing that much weight, ever. Switching a lighter group set (your gears) and derailleur, for example, saves the equivalent weight of 1/3 of an iPhone 4.You will not notice the difference. If you're entering the Tour de France, you'll want the absolute lightest bike you can get. Otherwise, stick to a few bigger, cost-effective fixes and work on getting stronger legs, not a lighter bike.


If you've got nice wheels and still want a lighter bike, get a carbon fiber seat or light, small pedals first. They won't make a huge difference, but they will make the bike lighter.

"
Understand that you should carry the minimum equipment possible on long tours.,
Consider getting front panniers to distribute your weight evenly.,
Be smart about your accessories.,
Get used to dirty clothes.,
Whenever possible, buy food day-by-day.,
Invest in lightweight camping equipment.,
Get rid of the minor stuff.",How to Make a Bicycle Lighter2," Bike touring is when you ride with all of your living requirements packed on your bike in panniers -- small bags that attach to your bike. Because you will be traveling long distances, every pound you can shave off of your bike will make a difference on your legs and lungs. The bare essentials that you should not skip on include:


Water bottles and purification tablets.
Hand pump.
Extra tubes and a tube patch kit.
Extra brake and derailleur cable.
Bike multitool.
Headlamp.
First-Aid kit, especially if spending time away from cities/towns.

, You should always use rear panniers first, but if adding a set of front panniers will reduce stress on vital bike parts and potentially help you climb. While it will not actually lighten your bike, it will keep your back tire, frame, bike rack, and rear brakes happy and help stabilize the bike.


Do not, however, use an extra set of panniers as an excuse to pack more. Simply redistribute your normal supplies among four bags instead of two.

, Do you really need separate dish soap, shampoo, body soap, and detergent, or will one all-purpose camping cleaner do just fine? Instead of reading a hardcover book, buy a few cheap paperbacks, rip off the covers, and burn or throw away the chapters when you finished reading them. Little tips like this make packing easier and keep you from unnecessary weight.


While a full sized bike pump may be easier to inflate tires with, a hand-pump is much lighter.
Instead of bringing dishes, pack a light plastic tupperware set. You can save left overs inside, use the bottom part as a bowl, and the top as a plate.

, Bike touring is not a glamorous affair, and you shouldn't expect to dress like it. You should have 2-3 pairs of bike shorts and jerseys, a lightweight rain jacket and/or pants, depending on climate, and a set of clean clothes to change into after riding. If it will be cold a night then a pair of pants, a hat, and gloves are all light and easy additions.


Never carry cotton clothes with you-- they are heavy and soak up water like sponges, making them even heavier.
Keep one pannier for dirty clothes and one for clean clothes, and re-wear dirty stuff as often as you can before switching to something clean.

, Unlike back country hikers, clever tour bikers don't have to carry all of their necessary food supplies on their back each day. If you plan your tour to run through at least one town every 1-2 days, you can cut down a ton of weight by purchasing your meals late in the day. If you stop near or in a town each day, buy that night's dinner and the next day's breakfast and check a map. If you'll be in a town sometime early the next day, buy lunch later and eat it on the side of the road, then repeat the next day.


Make sure you always have 3-4 high-carbohydrate riding snacks (granola/protien bars, fruit, dried cereal, etc.) on hand. When biking long distances you need to eat something every 30-60 minutes.Always have one lightweight ""emergency meal"" available in your bag. Granola, dried rice or pasta, beans, etc. in case you cannot find a place to stop.

, The same lessons learned by backpackers, who carry everything they need on their backs, can help you keep weight off your wheels. Lightweight tents, sleeping bags, and sleeping pads may not be quite as essential for a biker, but they will still make a big difference. Every camping brand offers light-weight variations on their equipment, but here are some hints for making do with the best you've got.


Split up tents between multiple riders. While a 1-2 person tent is definitely lightest, splitting a 4 person tent across 4 people may be even better. Have each person carry either the tarp, the poles, the tent, or the ground cover to cut the weight down per person.
Foam pads, including foam mattress toppers for twin beds in a pinch, are incredibly light, though they may be bulky.
Use the lightest-weight sleeping bag you can get. If you're touring the California coast in the summer, for example, your 0 degree bag is likely too heavy for your needs.

, If you’re serious about really making your bike as light and efficient as possible, all the little safety/convenience gear can be stripped. Reflectors on the wheel spokes, reflectors in the front and back of the bike, the kickstand, decorations, etc. can all go. If you're going to be riding on busy roads though, a light and some reflectors will be worth the minimal weight.e


Be smart when packing -- will you really read 3 books on the trip? Do you need the pair of nice, heavy jeans, ""just in case?"" Touring is about living simply and enjoying the scenery as you ride, not packing your entire life on a bike.

Carefully slide or cut off the old grip.,
Clean bar with soap/water to remove WD-40, dust, and gunk.,
Use 3-4 long, plastic ties as ""runners"" to slide your grip on.,
Apply a spray of hairspray, hand sanitizer, or other quick-evaporating substance inside the grip.,
Push the grip all the way onto the bar, twisting to align their contours.It can help to twist as you push, working it onto the handlebar bit by bit.",How to Install a New Handlebar Grip1," Sometimes, careful cutting with a razor blade is necessary; try not to scratch your chrome. If you want to save the grips without cutting, spray WD-40 between grip and handlebar, giving it 5-10 minutes to work its way into the grip. Twist to spread the WD-40 inside the grip and pull it off easily.


Stick a screwdriver between the bar and the grip if you cannot get under the grip well, using it to prop the grip up while you spray it down.
If stuck, you can use compressed air from a compressor or can to remove a grip.;
, Give the bars a good clean scrub, using an old rag or sponge to get them as clean as possible. This will make it much easier to get the new grip on and keep it there. When done, dry the whole thing off.


If they are open on the ends, make sure you dry off the inside of the handlebar as well. Water left in there after putting the new grip on can lead to rusting.

, Place the plastic ties in the grip on different sides, then use these smooth, low-friction areas to slide the grip onto the bike. Then simply pull the ties back out to finish installing.


Note that lock-on grips are gaining popularity -- they require a hex wrench (Allen key), but you can easily loosen the bolt, slide the grip on, then tighten it in place., If you don't have plastic ties, a little bit of an alcohol-based product, such as hairspray or sanitizer, may help you slide the grip easily. As a bonus, the grip will definitely stay on once you've got it in place. While not strictly necessary, this step can prevent the grip from immediately slipping off the bar if you have issues., While the snug fit may make it hard to get the grip on, you'll be thankful later when it doesn't come off mid-ride."

Determine the legal requirements for importing the bike.,
Search for a bike shipping service online.,
Arrange for the service to get the bike.,
Pay the service to import the bike.",How to Import a Bicycle1," Start by looking up the legality around importing a bike from a foreign country to your country. Your country will have specific guidelines around what you can import into the country. Make sure you are legally able to import a bike to your location.You can also find detailed information about importing personal items like bikes on your country’s Custom and Border Protection’s website.;
, There are several bike shipping services that you can hire to make importing the bicycle easy. Services like Luggage Forward and BikeFlights can box and ship the bike through the mail or by air. UPS also offers a by-mail option for shipping bikes for a fee.Do some research and look up several bike shipping services online. Read testimonials on their website to ensure they are reliable and trustworthy. Make sure their pricing is within your budget.

, Most shipping services will offer to pick up the bicycle for you and ship it. If you are buying the bicycle from a dealer online, have the dealer ship the bike through the service, or to your address directly. If you are importing the bicycle yourself, see if you can get the service to get it from you to ship.The service will likely be able to break the bike down for you so it is easier to ship. Contact the service directly to find out more.

, The cost of importing the bike will depend on the size and weight of the bike as well as the import fees for your country. A standard bike can cost between $150 and $200 to import. The shipping service should let you know all fees and costs upfront.Once you pay the service, they will give you a timeline of when you can expect the bike to arrive. You can also track the bike in the mail. It usually takes at least five to seven business days for the bike to arrive to an international destination.

Cut or unwind the old handlebar tape.,
Wash off any lumps of adhesive left by the old tape.,
Set up your workstation and prepare the bars for taping.,
Start each handlebar from the bottom, wrapping clockwise on the right and counter-clockwise on the left.,
Leave about half the tape hanging off the bottom of the bar on the first pass, wrapping 3-4 times as you work up.,
Work slowly, overlapping about a quarter of the tape with every turn, as you move up the bar.,
Lift the lever body (rubber covering at brakes/shifters) and wrap past this point to get to the top of the bars.,
Reverse your wrapping direction for the top of the bars.,
Cut the tape at your desired length and finish wrapping.,
Add some 2-3 wraps of electrical tape to hold the wrap in place.",How to Install a New Handlebar Grip2," You will rarely have to cut the tape off, and you should be careful not to nick the actual handlebar if you do. More often than not, you can simply unwind the old tape off the bike. Remove the cap at the end of the handlebars, using a flat-head screwdriver if needed.Before removing, note how far up the bars the old tape went. This is a good guide for when to end your own tape-up.

, Use a gentle degreaser, or some simply warm water and dish soap, to lightly remove the rest of the adhesive., Take some electrical tape and wrap any cables lightly to the bars, if they are not already pre-attached. Note where you want the tape to end, and get your knife or scissors ready to cut the excess tape when you're finished.Feeling extra pro -- wrap some double-sided tape around the bottom 2-3 inches of the bar to help keep your tape in place., Handlebars need to be wrapped in a way that prevents unwinding while you ride. Starting from the bottom prevents the wrap from sliding down under your hands. Furthermore, wrapping in the right direction for each hand prevents you from unwrapping as you ride (many people, when tired, clench their hands and twist them outwards).


Pull the tape tight -- you want a lot of tension for a tight, waterproof grip., Move up the bar, overlapping slightly for 3-4 wraps. Then push the cap into the exposed wrap, sucking it into the inside of the handlebar so that the cap holds the bottom of the tape in place. Repeat on both sides., If there is adhesive in tape, it is often covered. Pull off the covering now and slowly, tightly wrap the tape up and around the bar. You may have to pull and work the tape multiple times, making sure there are no gaps.


It is often best to test the tension of the tape before starting. Give a good tug to feel how tightly you can pull on the tape without ripping it.
To avoid gaps where the bar bends, you may have to overlap a bit more.

, The top of the handlebars, the flat part, need to be wrapped in reverse. As you finish the bottom of the bars, get as close to the levers as you can. Then skip over a small area where the bars bend and just start wrapping the top of the bars.

, This will be easy if you skip past the lever covering, as outlined above. Most riders will rotate their wrists back on the top bar, potentially unraveling the tape. This is why you change directions when getting to the top bar:The right side should be wrapped counter-clockwise.
The left side should be wrapped clockwise., You can ""overwrap"" it, then use a pen to mark the points you want to cut it. Then simply follow this line with scissors for a clean, professional tape-up.

, At the very end of the tape, use some ""finishing tape,"" to secure the wrap in place. Add enough that it cannot be easily unwound, usually using 1-2"" on the tape and 1-2"" on the bike frame.


For a better hold, use a lit match to melt the tapes together in a few places, ""welding"" your handlebar tape on."

Check the legal requirements for importing bikes.,
Decide if you are going to ship by air or by ground.,
Get a shipping box for the bike.,
Pay the importing costs.",How to Import a Bicycle2," Before you try importing the bike yourself, look up the legality around importing bikes to your country. Most countries allow you to import bicycles as long as they are subject to a safety inspection at the border. You may also not be able to import bicycles from certain countries, based on the rules around importing and shipping in your country.You can also look at your country’s Customs and Border Protection website for more information.

, Shipping a bike by air is often done if you are also flying from the country and want to fly the bike with you. Shipping by ground is more common and may be easier to do if you are importing the bike from afar. It may also be cheaper to ship the bike by mail.


If you are buying the bike from a foreign bike dealer, ask them if they’d suggest shipping by air or by ground. They may be able to advise the easiest option for you.

, You will need to package the bicycle so it can be shipped or flown to your country. You can purchase cardboard boxes made for bicycle parts at your local bike shop or post office.You can also invest in bike travel cases made of durable plastic. A bike travel case may be a good idea if you plan to ship the bike again or travel with it in the future.

, You will need to pay the importing costs for bringing the bike into your country. The import fees may be a percentage of the total cost of the bike, usually around 4-5%. You can find the exact import fee costs by contacting the Customs and Borders Protection department in your country."

Consider how much you want to spend for mounting hardware.,
Consider how high you want to hang your bike.,
Decide how bike will hang in relation to the wall.,
Determine what material the wall is made from.",How to Hang a Bike on the Wall1,"


No cost: Improvise a hanger from nails and/or a rope you have laying around. This method is not recommended, however, as it probably won't last long.



 



About a dollar: Get a utility hook and cover it with a piece of rubber to protect your bike. If you buy plastic-coated, screw-in hooks, you must get at least two if you want to hang your bike from the ceiling.







A few dollars: Buy a simple bicycle hanger from your local hardware or bike shop.





;
,


On or near the floor: This is easiest way to hang and take down your bike, but it won't free up as much floor space as other choices. If lifting your bike is a strain, this is the best height for you.







Somewhere between the floor and the ceiling: Hanging the bike higher on the wall will let you sweep under the bike without having to move it, but you will still have to walk around it. It won't be as hard to hang or retrieve as it will from the ceiling, but will be more difficult than hanging it near the floor.







From the ceiling or eaves: This option will free up the most space but also requires great effort when hanging and retrieving the bike. If your ceiling is tall enough, you may be able to walk under your bike once it's hanging from the ceiling. But you must be tall enough to reach the bike frame or you won't be able to pull it down.







,

Consider how you use the space and where you will probably stand to hang and retrieve your bike.

Frame parallel to the wall: This option lets your bike stay close to the wall, taking up usable wall space. This may be a good choice if you are only hanging one or two bikes. If you hang your bike parallel to the wall at ground level, the wheels should face downwards because there there is no reason (and it would be a pain) to turn the bike over every time.







Frame perpendicular to the wall: This takes up less wall space but more space in the room. It also requires more clearance from the wall. If you want to hang your bike in a corner next to a water heater or refrigerator, this may be the best choice. This is also an efficient way to hang multiple bikes.






Note: If you hang your bike perpendicularly to the wall, the wheels should face the wall and the frame should be vertical. This orientation will allow you to roll the bike up the wall and hook the front wheel by turning the handlebar, if you place the mounting hook correctly.

From the ceiling: If you hang your bike from the ceiling, the wheels should face upwards because otherwise it would be very difficult for you to hold the wheel rims to get the frame off of its hook(s).







,


If the wall is plaster or drywall: This means you will need to use a stud finder in determining where to hang your bike.







If the wall is wooden: This means you can drill your bike hook directly into the wall.







If the wall is stone: You may need a special drill attachment to make a hole in the stone for your hook.







"
"
Visit a bike shop, hardware or home improvement store to purchase the necessary materials.

,
Install your hardware.",How to Hang a Bike on the Wall2,",

Find a stud or a joist if you plan to hang your bike from the ceiling. To do this, you can either get a stud finder or, if your ceiling walls are finished, look for a line of nail heads through the paneling or drywall.






Measure to decide where your mounting hardware will attach to the wall. If you have a helper, have this person hold the bike where you want it to hang so that you can mark where the mounting screws will go.






Pre-drill holes for the mounting screws. Make sure the holes go into the middle of the stud or joist. Use larger screws screws (~2 inch, #10) for a ceiling mounted hook than for a wall mounted hook.






Attach the mounting hardware and try it out. Hang and retrieve the bike several times to make sure it works as you intended.
Note: This step is particularly important for children to try, because you must make sure they are able to hang and retrieve their bikes.

Instead of purchasing a standard hook or bike rack, consider a bicycle shelf for your storage needs.,
Determine which type of shelf you need based on several factors.",How to Hang a Bike on the Wall3,"


You can buy shelves from your local bike shop or online. They range from $20 to hundred of dollars.

,

If you want to easily store items like bike tools, panniers and cleaning cloths along with your bike, buy a shelf with extra hooks or cubes.






If you want to display your bike inside your home like a piece of wall art, get a decorative shelf that is beautiful as well as sturdy.

Know that you can use an old pair of drop handlebars to make a DIY bike holder.,
Attach your bars to a ""quill stem"" and turn them upside-down.,
Get a threaded steel pipe and wall flange that fits around your quill stem.,
Screw the steel pipe into the wall flange.,
Attach the wall flange to the wall.",How to Hang a Bike on the Wall4," The curvature of an old pair of handlebars makes it perfect for holding onto your bike, and it looks great too. You can usually pick up old drop bars at your local bike coop, off a beat-up bike in a garage sale or resell store, or at a scrap yard.

To prevent the rack from scratching your bike, wrap it in handlebar tape, or another soft material. Duct tape can work in a pinch, and some people have used an old bike tube as well., A bike stem is simply the part that attaches your bars to the bike frame. Quill stems come on older bikes, and are often found with your handlebars. They are made to fit directly into the frame, and resemble a curved, ""L"" shaped pipe with a clamp on the end to attach to the handlebars.

The handlebars will hold the bike, and the stem will attach the bars to the wall.

, The pipe should match the diameter of your stem so that you can simply slide the stem into the pipe. Threading is the set of grooves at the end, similar to a screw. The flange attaches to your wall. It is a metal disk with holes in it for screws and a large hole in the middle that you can slide your pipe into.

Most stems are fine with a 3/4"" diameter steal pipe. It should only be 4-5"" long, however.

, One side should have the bike stem firmly packed into the pipe. Take the other end and screw it into the flange to securely attach them.

You may need to readjust the stem so that the handlebars still face up.

, Locate a stud and use and electric drill to attach the wall flange, which should already have your handlebars and stem attached."

If none of your friends or colleagues ride, ask around in your community to see if there's a bike organization that can help. A local bike shop or bike co-op may be able to point you in the right direction. A friend can help motivate you to get going and provide personalized advice.;
, If you already have a bike that fits and suits you, you can skip this step. If you need a bike,


Consider renting or borrowing a bike at first. This is an especially good option if you don't already know how to ride one, or if you're not sure yet whether a bike is right for you.
Get a used bike. Garage sales and thrift stores often have bikes. Some bike co-ops and similar programs fix up donated bikes to sell to raise funds. Craigslist can also be a good source, but be very careful of scams and stolen bikes.
Don't get a low-end new bike. One way to avoid this is to visit a real bike shop—one that only sells bikes, not toothpaste or wrapping paper. If you don't have much to spend, you're probably better off getting a decent used bike and fixing it up. Department store bikes often exhibit problems with maintenance and durability.
Whatever bike you get, test it out before you buy it. Make sure it works well and fits you.
Get a bike that fits well and something that's comfortable. You don't need to look or dress like a bicycle racer to get across town for groceries, commute, or ride for fun, so don't be afraid to get something with a more upright, comfortable riding position, if that feels right to you.
Try waiting to get a good bike until you have ridden a borrowed or inexpensive used bike enough to know your needs and habits.

, At the very least, put air in the tires and oil the chain.

If the tubes don't hold air or the tires are old enough to be cracked, they may need to be replaced. You can do that job yourself or get help.






If anything is loose, stuck, or the chain is rusted, take your bike to a shop or get help from a bike co-op to do the repairs.
If you hear squeaking, grinding, or clunking beyond a minimum of chain noise, repair your bike or have it checked.

, It will help to start with the right size frame.


Adjust your handlebars.

Adjust your seat.

, If you've ridden before, even a long time ago, you probably remember how. Still, it's a good idea to practice a little, without the stress and traffic of cars.


Choose a day when you have some free time, with mild weather, ideally not rainy or windy, and not an extreme temperature.
Choose a quiet side street, paved bike trail, or parking lot.
Go a short, comfortable distance, around the block, or up and down the street.
Even an adult can learn to ride a bicycle. In the U.S., the League of American Bicyclists trains and certifies cycling instructors.

, There's no need to exhaust yourself. Pick a level route with low or moderate traffic on familiar streets. Go a mile or two, and come back. If you want, pick out a nearby library, shop or restaurant you'd like to visit, and make that your destination. Have fun!

, If you rode two miles this weekend, try riding three or four next weekend. If you ride to work one day this week, try riding two days next week. If your intended rides involve hills or traffic, work up to those, too.

,


Carry a good bike lock so you can lock up your bike while you visit a destination.

Wear a helmet. A well-fitting helmet properly adjusted is best both for safety and for comfort.
Get good front and rear lights and reflectors if you will be riding after dark.






Carry a water bottle for longer trips. Most bike frames include a pair of screws where you can mount a water bottle cage.
Carry a bike emergency kit, with a patch kit, pump, tire levers, an adjustable wrench if you need one, and a phone and some cash.
Learn to carry cargo on a bike. A bike can carry a lot more than just its rider. You can carry a change of clothes for bike commuting, your weekly groceries, or treasures you found at a garage sale along your way.






You don't need special apparel to ride, especially for short, casual rides. Just wear clothing that allows you to move and is comfortable for the weather. You may need to roll up your right pant leg, wrap a strap or rubber band around the cuff, or pull your sock up over it, to keep it out of the chain.

, If you intend to commute to work or run errands on a bike, you may find that your best route is not the same as your usual driving route. You can look for your commute route on a map, and then try it, either on a weekday when you have extra time or on a weekend, when you can afford to explore side streets and various alternatives.


Many mapping websites now have tools to try to find bike routes.
Some cities publish bike maps. Look for them online, or ask at the library, city hall, bike to work day, and other public events and places.
Some of the best bike routes don't have bike lanes. Explore residential side streets with low speed limits and little traffic.
Try out your route when you have time to spare, in case it takes you longer than you expected, or a street is busier than you intended.
Talk to a bike shop or a friend who is an experienced rider in your neighborhood. They may have insights that mapping programs don't.
Refine your route. Especially if you go to a particular destination frequently, you'll have lots of opportunities to try different side streets and alternatives.

Finding an old Raleigh.,
Take notes!,
Simple disassembly.,
Loosen brakes and wheel nuts to slide the wheels out easily.

,
Remove all brackets, gear and brake levers...make notes...

,
Most cranks on old Raleighs, are held in place with cotter pins.,
As with a modern bicycle unscrew the handlebar mount at the bottom of the headset and remove.

,
You should now have a stripped frame ready for for the fun bit, the revamp.

,
Nitromors is an excellent product for stripping paint off frames, follow the instructions and you can strip a frame in well under a day.

,
Make sure all surfaces are completely sanded down to remove all traces of old paintwork.,
Any car or bike shop should have a good range of products for a re-spray.,
Replace all brake cables, gear cables and brake pads.,
Heavily corroded hubs respond well to sanding, and in extreme cases re-spraying can make them look like new, you really don't need to buy new wheels.,
Re-assemble.,
Show off to all the east London fixed wheel losers.

",How to Disassemble and Recover a Vintage Raleigh," Raleighs are all around us, either in a skip for free or in a trendy London bike shop at a huge premium. Keep your eyes open! A good starting point is e-Bay or Gumtree. One recent acquisition was a 1970s 3-gear ladies. Raleigh 65 quid, not bad at all.;
, This may sound silly, but old bikes are held together by a perplexing system of brackets, screws, rivets and other fiddly bits, it is highly recommend taking detailed notes, or better yet photographing the order of brackets, cables screws and where they belong. Taking apart is one thing, but putting back together can be a nightmare!

, Wheels and brakes are pretty standard, much like modern bikes. Get rid of all the cabling first, it'll ride much better with a fresh set of cables (again especially if you have a three gear hub system make notes, the spotty oik in Halfords is not going to know what a three gear system is, let alone advise you on how to sort out the small pile of bits and bobs that a three gear cable consists of).

,,, You'll need to unscrew the top (at the base of the crank) and knock the pin out with a hammer. If your bike is pushing 20 years these pins will be VERY stiff. Persist, it will eventually fall out and the cranks will slide off easily.

,,,, Cosmetic rust also responds really well to sanding, make sure all your surfaces are even and wiped clean before the next step.

, You will need a good primer, your new snazzy color and a sealer, or lacquer to finish. if you do a re-spray at home it can cost as little as 20-30 pounds for a whole bike. Avoid spraying too close (this creates 'runs') and spray in even strokes to get good all over coats. Always follow directions on cans.

, It costs peanuts and really makes a bike feel like new.

, A sanding, a re-spray or a new set of tires make wheels look really good. If you can get hold of them white wall tires, they will always make a vintage Raleigh look ace!

, Leave your paint job to dry for as long as possible, and use your notes/photos to re-assemble you new rad-mobile!

Focus on what kind of cyclist you are.,
Choose the cushioning.,
Choose your saddle type.,
Decide whether to use a standard saddle or a special one.,
Try it.",How to Choose the Right Bike Saddle," This is an important step to help you determine which saddle best suits your needs.


Do you use the bike for short rides on a mainly flat itinerary, i.e. for commuting or just for recreational use? Or are you a more professional cyclist? And if the latter is your case, do you prefer road cycling or mountain trails?
Do you do very long rides, or do you prefer short ones? Identifying what kind of bicycle rider you are will help you choose the best saddle for you.;
, Depending on what kind of cyclist you are, you can choose between various types of cushioning. The most common are the following:


Foam: It is flexible, but at the same time, it gives support. There are various saddles depending on the foam's density. Generally speaking, longer rides require harder foam, while it is better to choose a softer saddle for short rides.
Gel: It is comfortable, absorbs shocks and vibrations and adapts to your body, but it also weights more than foam. In addition to this, gel can lose its softness with time and become hard.

, Now that you know everything about cushioning, you can move on and choose the saddle. Each one has its own characteristic, and each saddle is best suited for specific rides:


A general rule is that the more upright you are riding, the wider the saddle should be. Riding hunched over the bars on a wide saddle will cause much more pain than riding in the same position with a narrower saddle.
Racing saddle: It is narrow, tapered and quite hard. It's designed in order to avoid irritation, and to let the legs move freely. This kind of saddle shifts most of the cyclist's weight to the arms and legs. It is chosen mainly by professional cyclists going for long rides.
Comfort saddle: These saddles are much wider than racing ones and are softer, thanks to a more generous padding. They are designed to absorb shocks and let the cyclist ride comfortably. It is a good choice for recreational cyclists.
Cruiser saddle: Since cruiser bikes force you to maintain an upright position, these saddles have to bear most of your body's weight. For this reason, they have a great amount of cushioning and are wider than the previous two. In addition, they are suitable for occasional cyclists going for slow rides without too much effort.

, This choice depends entirely on you, since each one of us is made differently. Some cyclists prefer nose-less saddles to standard ones, because they reduce irritation during long rides; others go for a saddle with a softer channel in the middle or even with a hole. These options are intended to reduce pressure on the most delicate parts of the body, i.e. the perineum and genitals.


If you are a woman, consider the possibility to purchase a specific woman saddle. These are generally wider because women tend to have wider hips than men. Finally, there are high-quality saddle retailers, where professional cyclists can purchase custom cycling saddles specifically designed following their specifications.

, This guide may have helped you decide what kind of saddle may suit your needs, but the most important step to take is to try the saddle yourself. This is fundamental, because it is the only way in which you can realize if the saddle fits your body properly.

Place special reflectors on the front and rear tires.,
Purchase stick-on blinking lights.,
Make use of LED string lights.,
Apply string lights.",How to Decorate Your Bicycle1," Reflectors serve the dual purpose of making sure you are visible to others and setting your bike apart from other bikes. Custom reflectors can include different shapes and colors, as well as different sizes. Reflectors are often available at superstores, while specialty reflectors are best picked up at a dedicated cycling store or online.


If you love hearts and the color pink, you can purchase pink, heart-shaped reflectors.
If you are utilitarian in nature, you can find blinking reflectors to make your presence better known in the dark.;
, Stick-on blinking lights will make your bike unique, and make you extremely visible during the day and night. Although these are typically found at parades and other street events, they can also be purchased online and make a wonderful statement.Blinking lights can also be hazardous, as they can trigger headaches and even seizures in some. Make sure you are not sensitive to strobe lights or other effects before use.

, LED string lights are excellent for decorating, as most do not require an outside power source. These lights come in many different colors and lengths, and are a simple way to customize your bike.LED lights are available at most home improvement stores, but can also be purchased online.
You can place LED lights in the spokes of your wheels, or you can use zip ties to place them along the frame of your bike.

, String lights, unlike LED lights, will require you to do some modifications in order to power them, but can be a fun, inexpensive way to decorate your bike.If you go the route of string lights, make sure to follow a guide when creating a power source to avoid a fire hazard.
String lights work wonderfully to wrap around the frame of your bike to to add some interest to your handlebars. If you choose string lights, be sure to wrap them tightly around the metal to avoid a falling hazard.

Apply stickers designed for outdoor use.,
Get creative with application and location.,
Mix and match themes and colors.,
Layer stickers for an all-over change.",How to Decorate Your Bicycle2," Outdoor-use stickers, such as those designed for bikes or skateboards, are a great way to personalize your bike and come in many different designs and colors. Although you can use regular stickers, dirt and moisture will quickly break them down.To make sure your sticker will be placed the way you want it to be, consider marking where you’d like it with a pencil before application.
Many skate and bike shops sell these stickers, but you can also find them online through popular vendors such as Amazon, and online bike specialty stores.

, Instead of placing a few stickers on the sissy bar, get creative! Decorate your handlebars, handle grips, and even your spokes with stickers.If you don’t like the color of your bike, you can cover the frame entirely with overlapping stickers.
If you are a fan of patterns, you can place stickers at predetermined spots throughout the frame of your bike to create patterns.

, Get creative with the themes and colors of your stickers. Pair cartoon characters with earthy tones, and combine characters from your childhood with brand stickers. Pairing standard-use stickers with outdoor-use stickers could help the standard stickers last longer.

When choosing sticker pairs, opt for things you love. If you are a fan of both Hello Kitty and the Simpsons, for instance, you could create a small scene with these characters.

, Using washi tape or other stickers, layer to completely cover up your bike frame instead of painting it another color.To help your washi tape last longer, apply a coat of polyurethane or other sealant. This will ward against weather damage and peeling.
If washi tape is too expensive to cover your bike completely, you can also use patterned  duct tape. There are countless patterns and colors to choose from.

Painting bikes works well with vintage, muted colors such as teal, mint, and seafoam.
When selecting a paint, make sure you choose one intended for outdoor use.
Although you can purchase paint intended specifically for bikes, enlisting a paint formulated for metal will work just as well.

, If your bike has a bell, give it a little pop of a bright color, such as neon orange, or Pepto-Bismol pink. This is a perfect compromise for someone who does not like bright colors, but wants a unique aesthetic for their bike.You can even get creative and paint faces, animals, or designs onto your bike bell or horn.

, While painting your bike frame is pretty commonplace, painting the spokes provides a unique and interesting bit of color, and is fun to watch as your wheels turn, as it creates a rainbow effect., Although the paint job will eventually wear off with use, painting your bike’s tires provides an interesting look--particularly while you ride. To add flair to a vintage bike, for instance, you can paint your tires with white to create a whitewall effect common to vintage cars.Use outdoor paint, such as paint (or spray paint) intended for decks or treated wood.

, To keep your bike safe and unique, paint your bike with glow-in-the-dark paint. There are many different paint colors, ranging from a plain white to neon colors.Glow in the dark paint is readily available at supermarkets, hardware stores, and craft stores, as well as online. Craft stores are likely to have the widest array of colors.

, Paint pens are a great way to add personality and pizzazz to your bike, as you can create graffiti characters, doodles, and sketches.

If you are a skilled artist, you can showcase your talent by painting scenes onto your bike with a paint pen.
To preserve any designs you might create with a paint pen, seal your paint with a spray or paint-on sealant.

Add a basket for shopping trips.,
Purchase a special bike seat.,
Use colored bike components.,
Alter your handlebars.,
Add streamers to your handlebars.",How to Decorate Your Bicycle4," If your bike is in use for a commuter item, a basket is both adorable and useful. Bike baskets range in material from wicker to wood or plastic, and come in many different sizes.The frequency with which you use your bike will help determine what basket you need to purchase, as some are affixed with delicate materials such as leather.

, Altering your bike seat can provide a fresh look and a bit more comfort for your rear end. Leather seats lend a vintage look to your bike, while gel-pad seats add a massive comfort factor., Colored wheels, spokes, shocks, and handlebars can all help decorate your bike. You can even have different colors for all of your bike’s components for a rainbow effect., You can change the shape of your handlebars altogether, or you can use tape, crepe, or paint to change the general appearance of your handlebars.If you do alter your handlebars, make sure you do not do anything to interfere with the brakes.

, Finally, add a delightfully child-like flair to your bike by adding streamers to your handle grips.Streamers can be created with old plastic bags, strips of fabric, or even old pom poms.
Commercial streamers come with small clips that are inserted into the ends of your bar grips. If you make your own streamers, you can fashion your own clips to attach them using supplies from a craft or hobby store.

Design a circuit that can take the ~6 volts from the motor, store it, and then convert it to the 5 volts that are needed for the USB device.,
Select a motor.,
Attach the motor close to the rear brake mounts directly on the bike frame using a piece of a meter stick between the motor and frame to act as a spacer, then tighten 2 hose-clamps around it.,
Build the circuit.,

Build an enclosure.",How to Charge a USB Device by Riding Your Bike," The circuit designed in this example complements the function of the MintyBoost USB charger, originally developed by Limor Fried, of Adafruit Industries. The MintyBoost uses AA batteries to charge portable electronic devices. This independently constructed circuit replaces the AA batteries and supplies power to the MintyBoost. This circuit reduces the ~6 volts from the motor to 2.5 volts. This allows the motor to charge the BOOSTCAP (140 F), which in turn supplies power to the MintyBoost circuitry. The ultracapacitor stores energy to continuously charge the USB device even while the bike is not in motion.

, In this example, the Maxon motor was chosen due to its smaller diameter. It also provides 6 volts whereas previous motors often give upwards of 20 volts, and that could make over-heating a huge issue. The cost of the Maxon 90 was US$275; for those wishing to build this project, a cheaper motor will suffice.

,
# Connect the motor and circuit. Speaker wire is a stranded wire, but it's durable because of its large diameter. Attach it to the frame with zip-ties.
, This will be the most difficult challenge of the process. Here are the details for the circuit in this tutorial:

Electricity from the motor first travels through a voltage regulator which will allow up to a continuous five amp current; a larger current than other regulators would pass. From there the voltage is stepped down to 2.5 volts which is the maximum the BOOSTCAP can store and safely handle. Once the BOOSTCAP attains 1.2 volts, it has enough power to allow the MintyBoost to provide a 5 volt source for the device being charged.
On the input wires, a 5A diode was attached so that there's no ""assisted-start effect,"" where the motor would start to spin by using the stored electricity.
The 2200uF capacitor was used to even out the power flow to the voltage regulator.
The voltage regulator used, an LM338, is adjustable depending on how you set it, as seen in the circuit diagram. The comparison of two resistors, 120ohm and 135 ohm, connected to the regulator determines the output voltage. It is used to reduce the voltage from ~6 volts to 2.5 volts.
The 2.5 volts are used to charge the ultracapacitor, a 140 farad, 2.5 volt BOOSTCAP made by Maxwell Technologies. The BOOSTCAP was chosen because its high capacitance will allow us to hold a charge even if the bike is stopped at a red light.
The next part of this circuit is the Adafruit MintyBoost. It is used to take the 2.5 volts from the ultracapacitor and step it up to a stable 5 volts, the USB standard. It uses a MAX756, 5 volt boost converter coupled with a 22uH inductor. Once we get 1.2 volts across the ultracapacitor, the MintyBoost will begin to output the 5 volts.


, In order to protect the circuit from external elements, an enclosure is necessary. A ""pill"" of PVC tubing and end caps is used in this example, with a diameter of 6 centimeter (2.4 in) and a length of 18 centimeter (7.1 in). While these dimensions are large when compared to the circuit, this made construction more convenient. A production model would be much smaller. The PVC was selected based on durability, nearly perfect weather-proofing, aerodynamic shape, and low cost. Experiments were also performed on containers crafted from raw carbon fiber soaked in epoxy. This structure proved to be both strong and light weight. However, the construction process was extremely time consuming and difficult to master."

Apply colored handlebar tape.,
Swap out your headset cap.,
Add a unique saddlebag.,
Buy a decal.,
Change how you sit.,
Apply a fresh coat of paint.,
Add accessories.,
Change your handlebars.",How to Customize a Bike1," Tape is a great way to accent your handlebars and provide a better grip at the same time.


Simply buy a colored tape from any store that sells bike accessories and wrap it flush against the handlebar until the entire surface area is covered. One layer of type will suffice.;
, Every bike has a cap that sits atop the headset where the steering portion is bolted together. The headset cap simply covers the bolt and is usually a bland color. You can swap out your current cap for a custom color or design and add flare to an otherwise ordinary bike part. The headset cap comes in different sizes. The surest way to figure out what cap size you have is to consult the manual that came with your bike or consult an employee at a local shop. The installation is simple and the cap should simply screw off and back on.

, Bags are a great way to attach extra space to your bike that stores objects like your phone, a water bottle, or anything else you might need. Rather than getting a run of the mill bag, you can get a great design or color to personalize your bike.


You can get a number of different bags depending on your preference. There are trunk bags that sit behind the seat, a handlebar bag that sits up front or some that nestle below the bike frame out of sight. , Decals are a great and simple way to spruce up your bike frame without investing the time or money to paint it. You can get your name, a favorite brand or even more fun ones that represent your interests and hobbies, like your favorite breed of dog!

, There are a lot of different types of bike seats that improve comfort and look great. Changing the material and cushioning of your seat is an easy customization. Gel cushioning. These mold to your body and provide great comfort for a casual rider.
Foam cushioning. This is great for long rides and those who weigh over 200 lbs. It’s great for long rides because it provides more support for your lower back but still enough give for comfort.
Leather saddles. These are becoming more popular. Although they take some time to break in, it will help keep you cool on long roads and is second to none in terms of durability. This is a great choice for someone who rides a lot.

, This can be time consuming and requires a little more work, but a new paint job can make your bike look new.


Make sure to clean your bike well getting off the rust and imperfections from wear and tear. Following this you can buy special primer and paints designed for bikes that turn your old dingy frame into a bright masterpiece.

, Maybe you want to change how your bike looks without changing the frame or bike itself. You can buy a lot of neat accessories and apply them to your bike and simply take them off when you tire of them.


Bells and horns. These can be great from a safety standpoint to alert people you’re riding near them, but can also add a unique spin to the front of your bike.
Water bottles and cages. Biking is hard and it’s important to stay hydrated. You can add water bottles and holders (cages) to your bike that look great while making sure you stay healthy.
Lights. If you like to ride later in the day, it’s important to stay visible. You can get lights that are solar or battery operated that come in different colors and make sure you stand out not only in the dark but also to your friends.

, You’ll want to make sure it doesn’t change the performance of the bike too much, but new handlebars can look great. Flat handlebars. These are the most common type of handlebar. They’re simple and light with great control but are not great for those who like to do tricks or high speeds.
Riser bars. These are basically flat handlebars that rise from the center clap area and are typically wider than flat bars. They give you great control, are good for your wrists, but can also make your bike less aerodynamic and thus slow it down.
Bullhorns. These aren’t great for turning but are otherwise great for high speeds and climbing. They curve up and forward from the center.
Drop bars. These have a straight middle section with each end curving downwards and towards the rider. These are a great general handlebar but are not recommended for frequent tight turns.

Pick the frame.,
Buy a lightweight fork.,
Pick road bike tires.",How to Customize a Bike2," Whether it's a used one online or a new frame from a bike shop you can swap out your frame for something a little more conducive to the speeds of the road like a carbon or aluminum frame that brings durability and lightweight.


You’ll want something light but the size of the frame is most often based on your height and weight.
The weight to shoot for the entire bike itself is under 20 lbs and the frames can help make up a lot of weight. You’ll want to consult someone from your local bike shop if you have any concern about your weight and the durability of a frame.

, Your bikes tires and frame are connected using a fork. Buy one made of carbon to give you that lightweight a road bike needs.

, Road tires are pretty narrow and are not built to withstand the bumps and rough terrain of mountain bikes. You’ll want a road touring or racing tire. There should be a number on the tires to indicate the size. You’ll want something that is a 700 width and should read something like 700x23. The first number is outer diameter of the tire in millimeters and the second number is the actual width of tire itself in millimeters.
Most road bikes use inflatable tubes and the tube can be replaced if your bike requires it in the future.

"
"
Find a sturdy frame.,
Get a comfortable seat.,
Make sure your tires are strong.",How to Customize a Bike3," You’ll want to get a light frame but and great suspension that can help absorb the shocks of bumps and rocks. You’ll want the frame to be in the 18’’ to 19’’ range and a frame that weighs around 7 lbs. The shock absorbers can be complicated. There are different strengths designed for different pressures and can be either air or spring based.

, If you plan on a lot of bumps, you’ll want to make sure that your seat has adequate padding and support. Carbon fiber is a popular material and does not have the same rigidity of a plastic shell. A broad, chair shaped seat is great for mountain bikes because they provide a good base.

, If you are thinking about taking your bike on rough terrain, you’ll want to make sure your tires are wide and have enough tread to not slip. They will also need to be thicker than a road tire so that you don't get a flat. You can readily find reinforced tires that have extra support for off roading. You’ll want a tire that is 29, 27.5 or 26 inches. The tire itself should spell out which size it is. The widths for a mountain bike ranges from 1.8-2.2 inches.

Check your paperwork.,
Service your car.,
Lubricate the car.,
Clean the interior.,
Care for the exterior.,
Ensure that the battery is fully charged.,
Deflate your tires to 10psi less than manufacturers recommendation and place the vehicle on jack stands if storing for more than 6 months.,
Cover your vehicle.",How to Prepare Your Car for Long Term Storage," Renew your registration if it will expire while you store your vehicle, or set a reminder to do so when it is due. Also, contact your insurance company to inform them that you will be storing your car and confirm your car is fully covered by your existing insurance policy.;
, It is important that your engine and fluids are in good shape before you store your vehicle for a long period. Otherwise, you risk having your car not start when you are ready to use it again.

Change or top off fluids which may contain sediments as appropriate. This includes oil (Synthetic oil breaks down more slowly with time which makes it preferred for storage), coolant, transmission, and brake fluid.






Run out windshield washer fluid in regions susceptible to freezing to protect spray hoses from freeze and thaw cracks.






Fill your car with gasoline as it leaves less airspace for moist air to enter the engine and form condensation (or ice) and add a fuel stabilizer available at any hardware/parts store.






Check belts, filters, hoses, and other components of your engine. Ensure that all are in working order and clean.







, Oil the hinges of the hood, doors, and trunk. Use a graphite-based lubricant for locks. Coat rubber parts of the doors and tires with silicone or white lithium grease. This will help prevent them from freezing shut.

, Throw away any trash. Vacuum seats and floor mats to prevent damage. Do not use chemical protectant (i.e. Armor All) on leather, vinyl, and other fabric as these may stain or cause excessive chemical damage to surfaces. Wash the inside of your windows. Getting the interior of your car in shape before storing it will prevent smells and potential damage from the sun or heat.

, Wash, buff, and wax your car. Have it detailed, if possible. Make sure to clean the underside of your car as anything stuck to the bottom of the car acts like a sponge, trapping moisture that could lead to the creation of rust. Remove wiper blades or lift them up so they do not become deformed or flat. Ensure all leaves, pine needles, and other debris have been removed from the engine compartment and the windshield wiper cowl (The black thing between the hood and the windshield where the wipers come out of.)

, Electronics can quickly drain the power of your battery, so make sure it is charged before you store your vehicle. You can also consider using a trickle charger. Disconnect your battery if storing for more than 6 months. Take the disconnected battery someplace temperate and dry (A Basement).

, This allows the rubber to relax and prevents cracking while allowing you to still drive on them when you remove the vehicle from storage. There are theories of ""Flat Spots"" if a vehicle is stored on the ground, but newer tires are engineered to prevent this and any flat spots will be worked out within 100 miles (160 km) or so. This does not apply to antique vehicles (Ford Model ""X"" or vehicles with non-belted tires)

, Vehicle covers protect your car from sun damage, dust, and minor dings. Try to find a vehicle cover designed for long-term storage. These will not trap moisture, but allow your vehicle to breathe. "

Vacuum the interior of the car.,
Clean windows and mirrors with an ammonia-based glass cleaner, or just use a solution of water with a few drops of ammonia.,
Protect your upholstery.,
Examine the weather stripping on the windows.,
Use a moisture-absorbing product.",How to Prepare the Interior of Your Car for Storage," Make sure you lift all mats so that you can thoroughly clean door panels as well as the trunk and other storage areas inside the car. Don’t forget the glove box. If you have stains on the carpet or upholstery, clean them and dry completely. Dirt left in the fabric or carpet is a source of moisture that could lead to damage.;
, This is safer for the environment and saves you from having to spend a lot of money on fancy solutions. The residue that is present after you clean may be due to breakdown of trim and weather stripping around the windows. Avoid these areas when you spray and clean the windows.

, If you have leather, clean and condition with a high quality cleaner or just use some saddle soap. Likewise for vinyl, choose a product that will produce the desired results. Water and a small amount of soap will usually do the trick and will be environmentally friendly. Use just enough so that you don't introduce too much moisture to the surface being cleaned.

, If the strips are cracked or torn, replace them. This will provide an airtight seal to keep moisture from entering your car. Always store your vehicle with the windows rolled up. Stripping was meant to be in the compressed state. Closing windows will keep moisture and pests from easily entering the vehicle.

, Drypack is a nontoxic natural clay product that can be safely placed inside the glove box, trunk, and on floorboards to provide the maximum protection from moisture damage inside your classic. To eliminate the presence of pests and rodents, consider buying a high frequency emitting devise. These are not necessarily effective, so be sure to research these thoroughly through Consumer Reports or similar before investing your money.

Change oil and filter.,
Grease steering and suspension components.,
Disconnect battery (for older vehicles).,
Place battery on a trickle charger (newer vehicles that require a constant source of power).,
Top off fuel tank and add fuel stabilizer.,
Make sure parking brake is not engaged.",How to Prepare a Car for Storage," If you don't clean and protect the paint, any dirt or contaminants left on the car will corrode the paint, and turn into rust.;
, Again, dirt and debris can cause damage if left to sit for an extended period of time.

, A full fluid reservoir will leave no space for condensation to occur.

, Old oil will become acidic and eat away at the inside of your engine. However, fresh oil will take much longer to break down. So, your engine seals should remain in good condition throughout the storage.

, A full grease service will keep the seals, and rubber bushings in your suspension from drying out while the car's in storage.

, If your battery is left connected, its charge will completely deplete, causing one or more of the inner cells to go bad.

, Most newer vehicles are equipped with advanced computer systems, which require constant power. Otherwise, they'll have to be completely reprogrammed.

, A full tank means that there's less room for condensation, and a stabilizer will keep the gas from breaking down and evaporating.

, If your vehicle sits for an extended period of time with the parking brake on, the brake pads can rust to the rotor/drum, causing the wheel to seize. Instead, use a set of wheel chocks to keep the vehicle in place.

Learn how to ride if you don't already know.,
Learn about the basic types of bikes.,
Think about your intended usage.,
Decide between quality and price.,
Know what types of terrain you’ll be biking on.,
Decide on your desired comfort level.,
Find a bike that fits you well.,
Test ride a bike before you buy it.,
Test the weight and materials.,
Buy or have your bike professionally assembled.",How to Choose a Bicycle," That's the first and most important step. You can do this on practically any bike that is the right size for you. Starting on a basic single speed bike with coaster brakes is usually best. Since you don't have to worry about shifting gears and front/rear braking sequences, these bikes offer an easily learning curve.;
, There are many different types of bikes that offer a wide range of capabilities. If you live in a city, you probably want a bike that’s built for roads. If you live somewhere where you can bike on trails, then a mountain bike might be more your speed. Standard bikes. These are old-fashioned, single speed bikes with coaster brakes (pedal backward to brake). Good for leisurely riding around town if there are no serious hills or other obstacles.
BMX bikes. Low profile bikes with 20 inch (50.8 cm), usually knobby tires. These are for ""competition"" biking on trails or courses. And have cable operated caliper brakes on the front and rear. These bikes are single geared bikes.
Road bikes. This is a general term for traditional looking, and racing like bicycles designed for good performance on pavement. There is a wide range of options within this category. Road bikes can often be classified into two broad groups of racing/performance or touring.

Racing bikes are designed for pure speed with an emphasis on light weight, and place the rider in an aggressive posture.
Touring bikes are designed for sustained comfort and carrying loads. They have heavier components for durability, mounts for rack and fender attachments, and have a more upright riding position. Road bikes traditionally have ""drop"" or ""aero"" handlebars. These handlebars allow the rider a range of hand placements for comfort or for achieving an aerodynamic riding position.


Mountain bikes. Bikes designed for off-road use, with compact frames, stable handling, clearance for wide and knobby tires, and higher handlebars for a more upright position. For hilly terrain, these bikes will generally come with low-range gearing. There are many types designed for specific purposes, such as downhill versus cross-country racing. Mountain bikes can be equipped with sophisticated suspension and disc brake systems. Mountain bikes are also very popular as all-around bicycles due to versatility.
Tandem bikes. These bikes have an extra seat and set of pedals for two people to ride together.
Recumbent bikes. These bicycles seat the rider in a ""reclining"" position with the pedals positioned forward, which is a more natural position requiring less flexibility than upright bikes. These bikes can be fitted with windshields for good aerodynamic performance. However, these are generally heavier and can't match the performance of upright racing style bikes.

, If you intend to ride your bike on trails and unpaved roads, a mountain bike is a good fit. If you don't intend to ride on unpaved trails and live in a city, a road bike will be more efficient.


Racing style bikes will not be as comfortable or practical for casual riders. Depending on where you live, shops may be limited to mostly racing and mountain bikes. A popular middle ground that you may find is the ""hybrid"" style bike. Hybrid bikes often mix elements of both road and mountain bikes. Hybrid bikes typically have thicker wheels and a wider seat. Frames are usually fairly light and most use caliper hand brakes. When deciding on a bike that will work for you, ask yourself a few questions to get started. What will your average riding time be? How often will you use your bike? Are you getting a bike for fun or more for transportation? What have you ridden in the past?
Being able to answer these basic question will give you a good picture of what kinds of features you need in a bike. If you plan to ride your bike to work everyday, you probably want more of a road bike that is fast and light. If you want a bike you can attach extra components to like a basket and ride around, a hybrid or cruiser might work. And if you plan on exercising and riding trails, then a mountain bike is what you’re looking for.

, Bicycles will vary in price depending on what type you’re looking at, where you’re looking, and the quality of materials. Road bikes will be better for commuting and speed, but can get expensive depending on the quality of materials. Cruiser or hybrid bikes sometimes offer more room to add accessories like baskets and saddle bags. If you intend to mount a basket, saddlebags, or a baby seat, you will want to be sure the frame is compatible with these devices. Many bike shops have complete assemblies with these attachments already mounted.
If you plan on attaching a lot of accessories, avoid bikes from big box stores. These bikes, while less expensive, don’t typically offer suitable construction for attachments. Because the materials aren’t as good, adding too much weight can cause your bike to break down or not perform.
Think about how long and how often you plan on having and using your bike. If you are planning to commute to work most days, invest in a higher quality bike. While more expensive, higher quality bikes will last longer and are constructed with durable, lightweight materials that will make performance better and last longer.

, Road and mountain bikes usually have gears and shifters, often operated by some kind of trigger. Bikes that can shift gears are very useful for most riders, especially in hilly terrain, or for high performance. Fixie bikes don’t have shifters, are lighter and faster, good for flat commutes, but require some skill.


Bikes that have gears let you adjust your pedaling effort to account for hills, wind, or your own fatigue. However, these systems also add significant cost, complexity, and weight.
Many riders commuting on busy, mostly flat, streets who want speed choose a bike with a single gear (""single speed"" or fixie bikes). Most bikes can be converted to a single speed. But unless the frame is designed for it, a chain tensioner will be required. A fixie is good for riders who want a minimal, fast bike. However, these bikes require practice and skill to get used to. Fixies don’t have freewheel so you have to pedal constantly to move. Single speed bikes are similar to fixies, except a single speed does have a freewheel and lets you coast.

, Comfort on a bike goes beyond how you feel on the seat. Depending on where you’ll be biking and your average commuting time, you want a bike that makes you feel comfortable and in control. Cruiser bikes typically have a bigger seat and let you sit upright. Touring bikes allow for good carrying capacity and typically have drop handlebars for a more aerodynamic position. Road bikes also allow for an aerodynamic position but can be uncomfortable due to smaller, light parts built for speed over comfort.


Choose a mountain bike if you like going over large bumps and dirt. Many mountain bikes have at least a front suspension to improve comfort and steering control on rough surfaces. Mountain bikes can also be good for general urban riding, due to stability and for going over curbs and the like. Beginners may find mountain bike handlebars and controls easier to use.
Choose a road or touring bike if you’re riding on mostly flat roads and terrain. These bikes typically have drop handlebars that allow for several hand positions and postures. Touring bikes provide more comfort if you plan on carrying a lot with you because these bikes are outfitted with the necessary mounting bolts for cargo. Touring and road bikes also offer different gears which help you change resistance if you encounter a hill or strong winds.
Hybrid bikes are good if you find more comfort in sitting upright and want a more padded saddle. Tires on hybrid bikes are wider and more durable than both road and touring bikes, and can be ridden on different terrains with ease.

, The fit of the bike is essential to consider. Different bikes have different dimensions for varying body types. Make sure the straddle height isn't too high for you. Mounting and dismounting should be comfortable and easy. Make sure you have a good reach to the handlebars. When gripping the handlebars, you want a slight bend in your elbow. You should be able to easily grip your handlebars without having to bend over too much, even on road or racing bikes. When riding you want to be able to keep your head up without straining your neck. If you’re reaching too far forward and looking at the ground, your handlebars are too far away from your seat.
Frame size and seat height will affect comfort as well. Look for a bike that you can easily adjust the seat height on. You should be able to easily touch your feet on the ground and maintain control over your bike.
While you can make adjustments to most bikes, you want to look for one that provides you with a good saddle position. You want your knee to be directly above the ball of your foot when your pedal is in the 3 o’clock position. This will provide consistent movement and make it easier on your knees.
Check wheel size. Bikes come equipped with tires from 12"" for children's bikes, up to a standard 26 or 28 inch (66.0 or 71.1 cm), for adults, and even higher for specialized racing bikes. Larger wheels may improve your speed, but if your wheels are too large for your body, riding will be more difficult.

, If you can't get the bike shop to let you try a bike out, go to another shop, or borrow one from a friend. It is easier to get a bike that fits than to adjust and get acclimated to one that doesn't.


Ride the bike around the block to get a good feel for it. You should feel comfortable and in control at all times. Make sure you can easily reach the handlebars and all the components, like shifters and brakes.
Test the gears and brakes. See how easy it is for you to shift gears and brake quickly. The bike should be responsive and shouldn’t take too much effort to adjust gears or brake on.
Practice turning corners. You want to be comfortable with maneuverability. Some bikes are lighter than others and require more precision when maneuvering. If you don’t feel comfortable on the bike, try out other ones to find something that feels natural.

, No matter the type of bike, there are different weights and materials in every one.

If you’re looking at a mountain bike, ask about the frame weight and how it affects performance. Though mountain bikes will typically be heavier than road bikes, you may find that for you, a heavier one will be harder to operate on the terrain. Check out the quality of the suspension. Full suspension mountain bikes are meant for serious off-road riders. You may not need the best suspension of you’re not solely riding over extremely rough terrain.
Road bikes and touring bikes offer a lot of options in the way of frames and frame construction. The more performance-based options might use a carbon frame. Carbon is a very lightweight material that helps with performance and speed. However, carbon frames can be more expensive. The material and shape of your frame can affect your comfort and speed, but might not be necessary for your type of riding. While carbon is popular for its lightweight nature, it’s easily damaged. Aluminum frames may be heavier, but are more durable and often less expensive. Get a bike with the right tires for your needs. Thinner tires, often on road bikes, are fast and lightweight. However, thinner tires aren’t good on rocky terrain and puncture easily. Touring bikes have slightly thicker tires with more tread, which allows for more versatility in terrain. The tread also helps grip on wet or slippery roads.

, This is especially true with derailleur equipped bikes, the components that keep your chain on your bike. Having a bike built professionally ensures all the nuts and bolts are installed and tightened correctly, as well as the accessories.


If you’re newer to cycling, you will have an easier time getting on the road with a professionally built bike. Bike shops will ensure that your bike is properly tuned and that the wheels are properly aligned.
By getting a professionally assembled bike, you will also make sure that every component from the position of the saddle to any accessories has been outfitted for you. A bike shop will be able to take your measurements and tailor any bike to fit your body perfectly, allowing for the best, safest riding conditions.

Deregister your car in the Netherlands.,
Arrange export documents.,
Get an Insurance.,
Arrange transport.,
Register your car in country of destination.,
Vehicles exported to a country outside the European Union need to have an EAD Customs document .",How to Import a Car from the Netherlands," The following items are required for deregistration (not always mandatory for new cars): The complete and most recent vehicle registration document Part I (IA), Part II (IB) and a Copy of Part III/Transfer certificate (II); These documents you need to receive from the seller. You also need to have an original identity paper and license plates.;
, The VWE is the organization in The Netherlands for registration of vehicles and will subsequently deregister your vehicle in the vehicle register. They also will provide you an export declaration an export certificate.

, Before transporting the car you need to arrange an insurance which will cover the risks. Please be sure that possible damage during the specific way of transport (sea, air, road or combination) is covered. It is advised to apply for this insurance in your country or arrange it with the transport agents.

, You can either choose to use a transporter or drive the car by yourself to the country of destination. When you want to drive your car an export registration is mandatory. With this document you have 14 days time to take your car to country of destination. An insurance is also mandatory in this case.

, In many countries it is required to have a declaration of type-approval data. The VWE in The Netherlands can issue this which makes the import a lot easier. On this document the technical date, the type-approval number and the European class of vehicle can be found.

, The customs document is stamped at the EU border as proof that the vehicle has actually been exported

Get the lights adjusted.,
Send your Certificate of Conformity and something to prove you've got the lights adjusted (the receipt) and the speedo converted off to the Vehicle Certification Authority.,
Fill out the V55/5.,
Fill out the VAT414 form.,
Checklist - you should now have the following:


Complete V55/5
Completed VAT414
MOT certificate
Certificate of Insurance
Mutual Recognition Certificate
Fahrzeugbrief and green booklet (registration documents - If in doubt take all the paper your dealer gave you)
Photo card License
Chequebook

,
Make your way down to the DVLA local office and stand in a queue, and pay over your last cheque for £38, plus whatever it costs for a year's registration - £170 or so.",How to Import a Used Car from Germany to the UK," http://uk.mobile.de is a great resource. It's got a lot of dealers listed and much of the info can be seen in English. Choose the ones you want to have a look at, and try contacting the dealers to determine whether they speak your language or can answer any questions immediately.;
, Whenever you're ready, take a trip to Germany to check out the cars. Pick a dealer who can offer you a guarantee, will arrange the transit plates, who speaks English and who you think is being honest with you.

, You should be able to pay the deposit with a credit card, and wire the rest from your bank once you get home. Also, shop around for insurance - Direct Line (and probably others) can insure the car based on the Chassis number (make sure you get that before you leave). Also get them to post you a green card for the trip back from Germany, and remember to take it with you when you leave. Alternatively, you can usually arrange temporary insurance with the dealer, but it will be 3rd party only.

, Sign about 30 pieces of paper, all in German, get the keys and a pile of paper including the Fahrzeugbrief, which is your ownership document. Make sure all the bits that you paid for are in the car. Drive like the clappers back to England.

, This is the fun bit. Different steps may apply for RHD vehicles, vehicles that are less than 3 years old (and so don't require an MOT) or older than 10 (and so require SVA rather than Type approval), or vehicle from outside the EC. New vehicles are definitely different.

, The form you want is a V55/5.

, They will, in turn, ask you for a letter containing your chassis number and a cheque for £60 or so, and will send one through in the post 10 days or so later (they have to send to Germany to get it). This is to get the vehicle ""Type approved"", which means the model you have is in general approved for use in the UK. The certificate is in German and has info about the length, weight, emission levels etc. of the car.

, You need to modify the headlights to point the other way (on a Porsche 996 they can be adjusted and don't need replacing). You also need the fog light on the other side, which is, at least on the 1998 model, not as simple as moving the bulb over. Get the receipt showing you had the work done. You also need to put the speedo into MPH, although with a digital speedo this is easily done. Total cost will vary.

, Ask them for a Mutual Recognition Certificate. This lot want £65 or so, but a week later will send you back your original documents and your all important certificate.

, Most of the info you need is on the Certificate of Conformity, but it's in German. You can use Google translation tool, which copes fairly well even with phrases like ""Unladen rear axle load"". Some fields you can safely skip (max permissible trailer weight was left blank) and some you might be able to skip (a 1998 model doesn't need it's CO2 emissions checked, and it seems there's no engine number on a 996). If in doubt, call the DVLA and ask them.

, At the end it says ""Did you pay VAT?"". Tick no and leave the rest, which according to a nice chap at customs, you only need to complete if you are a VAT registered entity.

,, A week or so later you should receive your papers back in the post, including your tax disc and a piece of paper you need to get a license plate made up. The V5 will follow a few weeks later from head office. Then you just need to get a plate made up and you're away.

, Check your own car or buy a car that conforms to U.S. standards for safety and emissions by checking official lists for vehicles that conform or can be modified to conform to all requirements., Check to see if the vehicle complies with U.S. standards by inspecting or having the vehicle inspected by someone else for two different stickers. Look for a Department of Transportation (DOT) sticker in the doorjamb on the driver’s side of the car, and an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sticker on the car’s engine.If either of these stickers are missing, you will need to get a letter or certificate from the certified manufacturer of the car that states that the car meets U.S. standards.
If you are importing a vehicle that is 25 years old or older, it does not need to conform to EPA and DOT requirements, although you will still need to complete EPA and DOT paperwork in order to clear your vehicle through Customs and Border Protection (CBP)., If the vehicle does not meet U.S. safety and emissions standards, you will need to import it through an independent commercial importer (ICI) to perform modifications to make the car EPA compliant, or a registered importer (RI) to make DOT-approved safety modifications, before it is released to you. Note that some vehicles may not be eligible for these importer modifications.Consult the Environmental Protection Agency’s website to find an ICI before you begin the process of importing your vehicle.Refer to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to locate an RI.The advantage of using an ICI or an RI is that you may be able to import the vehicle you wish even if it doesn’t comply with U.S. standards to begin with. However, the disadvantage is that the fees associated with modifying and importing a car in this way are very high.

, Complete this Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) form, which can be obtained online and completed in advance of importing the vehicle. You’ll need detailed information about the vehicle make and model, the status and use of the vehicle, and the ICI (if applicable)., Complete this Department of Transportation (DOT) form, which you can download and complete in advance of importing. You’ll need information about the vehicle make and model, the date and port of entry into the U.S., and the RI (if applicable)., Fill out this form with details about the vehicle and its value as evidence of the import through Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Complete this form at a valid CBP port (usually wherever it first enters the U.S.). You’ll need:


Valid proof of ownership: the original certificate of title or a certified copy of the original
Manufacturer’s letter/certificate: states that the vehicle conforms to U.S. EPA and DOT standards (you do not need this if the vehicle already has valid stickers)
Completed EPA Form 3520-1 and DOT Form HS-7., Arrange for the vehicle to be steam-sprayed or cleaned thoroughly directly before shipment in order for it to pass the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s requirement to remove foreign soil from the undercarriage of imported cars., Find a vehicle shipment company to transport your car to the U.S., and have them notify you of the arrival date so you can submit your paperwork to Customs and Border Protection (CBP).


The shipping process should take approximately 10-17 days at $1,500-4,200 US Dollars, depending on the vehicle and the port of entry., Choose the port nearest to you to have your vehicle shipped to; most shipping companies will ship to ports all over the U.S. Note that the first port of entry into the U.S. is where the vehicle will be checked through Customs and Border Protection (CBP).


If you cannot be present at the first port of entry, you will need to employ a CBP broker to handle your entry.Most shipping companies will also require a notarized letter of authorization for anyone other than you to pick up the car., Pay a duty fee on your vehicle based on the price you paid for it or its blue book value. Duty rates are 2.5% on cars and 24% on trucks. You may be able to use an exemption toward this fee if you are a U.S. resident; check with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to confirm this., Depending on the type of your car, some imported vehicles are subject to the U.S. gas-guzzler tax. Pay the tax if your vehicle has a fuel economy rating of less than 22.5 miles per gallon, which can be determined by the manufacturer or an independent professional in the U.S., Register your imported car and acquire state license plates from your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Ask what documents they need from you or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to complete these measures for a foreign car. You may also need or want to obtain an International Registration Marker."
"
Before you import the car consider the following:

,All vehicles need an approved Application for Approval to Import a Vehicle- VSB10 from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government

,
If the car is manufactured after 1/1/1989, it must be included on the SEVS (Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme) register issued by the government.,
If it was built before 1/1/1989, it is a lot easier, depending on your state regulations it may not need to be complied, although there may be changes needed to pass local registration regulations.,
The aircon will need to be degassed and a certificate supplied (if the aircon is an older type of gas, R-12).

,
Unless older than about 1970, LHD vehicles will need to be converted to RHD with an engineers approval.,Read up at http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/vehicle_regulation/bulletin/importing_vehicles/index.aspx

,
Taking the above into account you need to find the car you want to import.,
Talk to the RAW of your choice if post 1989 to make sure they are able to comply the particular model variant you are interested in.

,
Once you have found your car its time to pay your exporter their fee and the cost of the car FOB (freight on board).

,
Your exporter will then give you all of the shipping information.

,
Usually the car is shipped out within the next week/ month depending on the destination and booking availability.

,
If pre 1989 find a Customs Agent and give them the VSB10 approval, Degassing Certificate (which may be a stamp on the invoice), the vehicle invoice and the freight invoice (which can be prepaid or COD).

,If post 1989 the RAW will usually have their own import agent

,
Once the car arrives its time to make the next payment which is for: freight, import duty, GST, quarantine, customs clearance fees.

,
Pre 1989, once the car has been through quarantine you can then pick it up with a release document from quarantine and your Customs Agent .

,
Post 1989 your RAW will arrange pickup of the vehicle.

,
Once complied by the RAW you will then need a temp.,
An officer will then inspect the vehicle, the compliance plate and your docs.

,
With luck your Japanese car is now registered and can be driven on Australian roads!

,
New seat belts are fitted;
,Child restraint anchorage points

,Anti intrusion bars fitted (if not factory installed)

,The filler neck for fuel changed

,New filters are installed

,All vehicle fluids are replaced

,New tires

,An Engineer's inspection is carried out

,Brakes Pads checked

,Once this process is completed and the car meets Australian standards a compliance plate is fitted and the vehicle can be registered.",How to Import a Car from Japan to Australia,",, It needs to be complied by a RAW or Registered Automotive Workshop for that vehicle, and it must be imported in their name, not yours. They will arrange an import approval from the Vehicle Safety Standard board using the VSB 10 form. #The aircon must be be degassed before import and a certificate supplied. #Compliance costs vary according to what is needed to be done to the vehicle and how many are complied each year, usually the more complied, the less the cost.

, It will still need an approved VSB10.

,, Be aware that a lot of american RV's will not pass registration due to excessive rear overhangs. In Western Australia there is no need to convert a car to LHD if the car is manufactured prior to 1/1/1989.

,, www.caraucjapan.com

Open all the different closures of your car to begin cleaning.,
Make some noise to scare away any nesting animals.,
Perform a walk around to gauge the outside condition of your car.,
Check and prep your tires.,
Look for spills and puddles under the car to find leaks.,
Look around under the hood for any debris.,
Check out the various replaceable engine components to determine their condition.",How to Bring Your Classic Car Out of Storage1," Make sure to gain access to every enclosed area of your car, as this is where dirt and dust are likely to have accumulated.


Pop the hood.
Pop the glove box.
Get the trunk open.;
, Creating noise will scare away most animals that have taken residence in your car while it was in storage.


Give them a few minutes to move out on their own.
Noise might not scare them off, at least not on the first try.
Sometimes mice, snakes, squirrels, birds, bats, hornets, and wasps will double down or hide.
Use your own judgment regarding how much risk you are willing to sustain, but keep in mind that biting animals can get into even the most secure storage facilities.
Try not to surprise any animals, because that can cause them to lash out and bite you.

, Take a walk around your car, and get a sense for its condition.


If you have stored your car outside, look for weeds or other plants that may have grown onto the car.
Clear away any plant matter with a weed-whacker and shears.

, If your car has been sitting on its tires while in storage, check your tires for signs of wear such as bulging, sagging, or deflation.


If your machine has been up on blocks or jackstands, use your pressure gauge to determine the pressure.
If your tires have lost air, use your compressor to top off any low tires, while the car is still supported on blocks.
Remember to check the tires again later, before you start rolling.

, While you are under the car checking or adding air to your tires, look for spills, puddles, wet spots, or just blotches of darkness that might indicate a leak.


If you find something, crawl under and see if you can determine what is leaking and from where.
The only things you'll really have to worry about at this stage are brake fluid and coolant.
A coolant leak can kill your car's engine, and a brake fluid leak can kill the driver.
If you find either of those two things leaking, or evidence that they have leaked, you should get them repaired before you even start your car.
Everything else can safely wait until you are out of storage and can make a trip to your garage, the local auto parts place, or your mechanic.
If your classic is a little low on oil or transmission fluid, you can top it off until the source of the leak is found and repairs are made.
A gas tank leak might not leave a puddle, but could at least leave you a stain to show that it was there.

, Before you put your hands or face near the engine area, just take a look around from a distance.


If there are animals nesting in the engine area, they might leave pieces of eaten filter, nutshells, and other debris scattered around.
Look for cobwebs and scat, and listen for the buzzing of bumblebees.
Give the engine a smell, and see if you smell the turpentine odor of bad gas.
Use a broom or shop vac to clear out any leavings and debris.
Avoid breathing in any rotting material or animal scat, as these materials can contain harmful molds and diseases.

, Now is a good time to see if any replaceable parts have worn or are decaying.


Expose the air filter to check its condition, clean it out, and replace it if necessary.
Reach into the engine bay and test the hoses and belts by tugging them.
Touch the wires to see if they disintegrate at your touch.
Look out for cracked, worn, aged, or dry rubber.
If anything does fall apart, make note of it so you can visit the parts store for a replacement.
If you have exposed the carburetor, leave it exposed for now.
If your filter is housed in an intake box, seal it back up once you know there is a new filter in place or that the old one is in acceptable condition.

"
"
Check your battery's condition to see if you have a charge.,
Check your car's oil level to determine if it needs more.,
Repeat the above process with your transmission fluid.,
Make sure you have the proper level of coolant.,
Check your brake fluid reservoir and power steering reservoir.,
Glance around the engine area for any signs of leaks.",How to Bring Your Classic Car Out of Storage2," If you brought your battery home and kept it on a trickle charger, all you have to do is put it back in and reconnect the terminals.


If not, depending on how long it's been, your battery might be very dead, or even unusable.
If the battery was left connected to the car, look for signs of corrosion.
Clean up any corrosion as needed, paying attention to the terminals and cables as well.
Pull the battery all the way out and make sure it did not leak acid and disintegrate the metal underneath it.
Once your battery and battery housing have been revitalized or replaced, go ahead and connect your battery charger.

, While you are still under the hood, check the oil, keeping in mind that a cold read (before the car's engine has heated the oil) will show the oil level as being a little low.


For now, just make sure there is some oil left in the engine.
Unless you found a large puddle of oil underneath, there should be some left.
Also check for any milky residue on the dipstick, which can indicate the presence of water in the engine.
If you find this type of residue, clean the dipstick and check again.
Pull the oil fill cap and check for this milky film.

If your oil is caramel or black you are probably fine, even if a little contamination shows up at first.
If the oil itself is milky, pasty, frothy, or full of bubbles, you should consider an oil change as soon as possible, and probably even a full oil flush at the first possible opportunity.



, Go through the same fluid checking process with your automatic transmission fluid, if your car has an automatic transmission.


Transmission fluid is sometimes called 'cherry juice', and that's what it should look like.
If you see any foaming, milkiness, or dark or blackish color, get a transmission flush at your earliest opportunity.
Other than looking for water contamination, just check to make sure there is some fluid present before starting your car.

, When checking for coolant, you want to see a full level, but most importantly you want to see a clean green (or orange, or red, depending on the car and which kind of antifreeze it takes).


Your coolant liquid should have no sign of any oil slick, brown, white, or black residue floating in it, or flakes and motes, which could be rust or indicative of some sort of stop-leak additive.
If the coolant level is low, top it off with distilled water.
Avoid using tap or hose water, and remember to add antifreeze in a similar proportion at some point.

, Check your break fluid and power steering reservoir levels, and make sure they are full.


These should show full levels, and if they do, you can cap them.
If not, you must replenish them before starting your car.

, Lastly, peek around for places where oil may have leaked, dripped, or seeped.


Sitting in storage, oil gaskets can dry out, and cause leaks.
You might not see them immediately, but take a look just to be sure there isn't a glaring problem that you have to deal with immediately.

Lower your car from the jacks or blocks.,
Drain your fuel tank to get rid of bad gas.,
Add ethanol to your fuel if you can't drain it.,
Fuel up with new gas to ensure that your engine runs properly.,
Start up your car.",How to Bring Your Classic Car Out of Storage3," If your car is suspended on blocks or jack stands, use a hydraulic jack to remove them.


First, raise the front of the car, and pull those front blocks or stands.
Then, repeat that process in the rear.
Once your car is standing on its tires, go around and check the tire pressure and fill them as needed.

, If there gas was left in your fuel tank for a long period of time, it may have gone a little flat and won't run properly.


You can generally tell if fuel has gone flat by a turpentine smell.
Although your car may start up on bad gas, running it through the engine can cause problems.

, To offset the problems caused by bad gas, take your small container of, empty it into the tank.


The ethanol will allow any moisture in the tank to mix with the gas, so that the moisture clears out as the fuel is burned, rather than sitting in the bottom of the tank causing problems.

, Although it is up to you whether or not you want to add your new, fresh gas right away, you should try to get rid of the old gas as soon as possible.


Add the canister of gas that you brought if there is no gas currently in the tank.
Otherwise, wait until the old gas is burned and then add your new canister.
Let your ethanol or new fuel mix stand for a few minutes to get a thorough mix.
There is no way to hasten this process, except to get the car started and moving, and on the way to the gas station.

, See if the car starts up on the first try.


If it does, don't over-rev, or put the car in gear just yet.
Let the car idle and warm up, to move oil around the engine.
If the engine doesn't start up, move on to the next step.

"
"
Double check that everything is in order.,
Prime the fuel lines to get gas in the carburetor.,
Add another teaspoon of raw gas to the venturi.,
Clean your spark plugs to fix a car that doesn't spark.,
Check your distributor to find bad contacts.,
Provide ventilation to avoid breathing in the fumes of your car.,
Let your car idle to avoid damaging the engine.,
Put the car in gear and park it somewhere safe.,
Re-check the fluids.",How to Bring Your Classic Car Out of Storage4," Make sure that your battery is indeed strong and charged, that everything on the motor (particularly the starter) is working, and that your fuel is at least marginally sound.


If these baseline requirements have not been met, make sure to address them, because your car will not start without them.

, If your car has been sitting for a while, all the fuel in the carb (if there is one) has probably evaporated, and what was in the fuel lines either has evaporated as well or drained back into the tank.


To get gas back where it needs to be, pump the gas pedal a couple times.
Then, try turning the key and let the engine turn over for just a few seconds.
If it doesn't fire up, stop, let it sit for a minute, and try again.
If you managed to get some fuel or oil in the carb, you will probably have to try a couple times to get the engine to start, because the fuel/air mix is off.
However, that little dose of gas will quite likely give you a sputtering start followed by a fail, followed by an engine that turns over but does not fire.

, If you get a sputtering start and then a fail, you can try adding another teaspoon of raw gas straight to the venturi, or just alternate turning it over and giving it a break, until it starts.


Because the fuel lines are empty, it will take a while to get fuel from the tank, through the pump, through the filter, and into your cylinders.
Your fuel pump doesn't work on air alone, so it might take a while and several tries, but the little bit of gas you are manually adding will eventually cause the engine to turn over, and draw additional fuel into the carburetor.
This is especially true on cars with a mechanical fuel pump.
If you have an electric pump, you might be able to hear it cavitating, and will hear a change in the sound it makes once actual fuel is moving through it.

, If you've been turning your engine over repeatedly, and it won't start, you probably have varnish or carbon deposits on your spark plugs.


Remove your spark plugs and give them a good soak in raw gas.
Clean them with a toothbrush and let them dry out before replacing them.
If you have new spark plugs, you can try replacing them entirely.

, You can also check the distributor, if there is one, to look for anything that could be preventing contact.


Any contaminants, such as rust or water, could cause bad contacts.
Use WD-40 to clean the contacts.
Be mindful that your distributor and wires must go back exactly how you found them.
If after you try all the above steps, your engine won't start, you may have more complex and serious problems keeping you from running.
You might need a rebuild or a new engine, but this probably won't be the case if the car was running when you put it into storage.

, Once the car is running, make sure you ventilate the room and avoid breathing in any engine fumes.


Expect smoke, and if your gas has gone bad, expect bad smelling smoke that lingers for a while.
If you are in a closed storage facility, get out, let the car warm up, and let the air clear.

, You can also expect some rough idling from your car, but don't let this tempt you to 'gun it'.


Let the idle even out on its own, and if the car has trouble keeping itself running, give it a little gas until things even out.
Once the engine is at its optimal temperature, the idle should start to level itself out on its own.
If not, it's most likely bad gas, so let it burn off some more of the bad gas while you add some good gas.

, If you haven't already, put the car in gear and roll it out of your storage facility, onto some pavement or gravel.


Someplace level is best, because you should now go back and check your fluids again.
Keep an eye out for fresh leaks and drips.

, After you warm up your car, the fluids' consistency may have changed to reflect their more accurate levels.


Automatic transmission fluid usually shows a correct level while the engine is warm, and the transmission is set in neutral or park.
Engine oil shows correctly with a warm engine, but with the engine off.
Let the car cool down before you check coolant levels, but if you have no visible leaks or detectable smells, you probably don't have to worry.
Do another walk around, to make sure tire air pressure is acceptable, top off fluids as needed, and find a good radio station.

Find lightweight material to make the cabin/basket for your airship.

,
Use a Styrofoam takeout food storage container or cut a plastic/aluminum sheet from a beverage container and shape the gondola the way you like.

,
Keep the weight of your airship as light as you can.,
Keep in mind that balloons can only lift the airship if it is lighter than the weight the helium/hot air mixture can displace.,
Shave off as much excess material that you can without loosing stability and strength of the airship.

,
Anchor your airship to a fishing/kite line to keep it from flying off if there is a strong gust of wind.

,
Select special occasion balloons with a message to your loved one or friends.

,
Make your own banner with a message and tie it to your very own airship.

,
Direct it and fly it for her/him and everyone to see.

,
Send them a message to look up to the sky.

Have fun!

",How to Make a Remote‐Controlled Air Ship,";
,,, Leave just a small opening where you will inflate the balloon.

,,,, Do not overfill the balloon.


Too much pressurized helium could burst the airtight seal and cause your airship to plummet and fall.
Keep the helium/air pressure inside the balloon just high enough to inflate most of the way. The buoyancy of your balloon is reduced when compressed and will not have as much lifting power as it should.

,


Keep the heat gun, heater, hairdryer at a safe distance. If the heat source is too close it can melt the foil/plastic of the balloon.

, You can choose from a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and color designs.

,


You can make a delta wing like a flock of ducks or the shape of a heart.

, You can arrange them in many different ways to keep them balanced.

, Keep the cords taught and short.


Tying the balloons with the cord/tape strings as closely to the gondola and the frame as possible helps to maintain more control of the airship.

, This is an option if you have a small budget and can't afford to make one that is larger.

,


Wind will drag the airship and make it difficult to control if weight of the drone is lighter.

,,,


The Infrared Remote controlled mini-helicopters are relatively inexpensive and come only in 3 different frequency bands to choose from (A-B-C).

,,,,, Using a small scale to check the weight of each part helps maintain your vessel balanced and afloat.


Every little gram/ounce counts as they add up in the end.

, The more weight you add, the larger or more balloons you'll have to use.

Change the oil and filter.,
Fill the fuel tank with fresh, premium fuel.,
Make sure coolant levels are proper.

,
Inflate the tires to proper pressure.,
Clean and wax the car.,
Consider placing a sheet of vapor barrier plastic under the car on the floor if being stored indoors.,
Open a window slightly if stored indoors, but not enough to allow small animals inside.,
Use a battery maintainer if the car will be stored for more than a month.,
Place a piece of plastic wrap on the windshield under the wiper blades, to prevent the rubber from sticking to the glass.,
Remove the spark plugs and spray a small amount of oil into the cylinders to prevent rusting, then insert the plugs again.,
If the car will be stored for extended periods of time, it is advisable to jack it up on axle stands to avoid flat spots in the tires.,
Release the parking brake.,
Place a note to yourself on the steering wheel outlining which optional steps above you carried out (rag in exhaust, rag in intake, carpets removed, battery removed, etc).,
Lock the doors.,
Use a car cover only for outdoor storage, or in very dusty locations.",How to Store a Car," If the car is being stored for an extended period of time, measured in years, talk to a mechanic about using oils without additives, which may include slightly caustic detergents.;
, Condensation in the tank is a problem in stored vehicles, and it is widely suggested that you fill the tank completely with Premium non-alcohol fuel in order to avoid any empty space where water can accumulate. However, the gasoline can become ""gummy"" over time, so it is useful to add a gasoline stabilizer, which is available for lawn mowers and other seasonal yard equipment. In some areas, premium gas does not contain ethanol which is corrosive and can release water when stored for long periods. Check with gasoline company distributor.

,, If you are storing for the winter in a cold climate, check the manual for proper pressures.Over inflation while in storage may help to prevent flat spots. After storage expect some thumping tires until they are driven 10 miles (16 km) or so.

, Be sure to wash under the car to remove any dirt, especially from the the wheel wells. Clean the interior extensively, being especially vigilant about all food scraps and particles; these can attract small animals. Removing the carpets for heated indoor storage will prevent them from becoming musty. Do not use Armor All® or similar products; these contain water, which may become trapped inside the car.fact

, This will prevent water vapor buildup in an unheated garage, and also makes it very easy to spot fluid leaks when the car is removed from storage., Put the top up if it's a convertible. Stuff a rag into the air intake and exhaust to prevent animals from nesting, covering this with a metal screen (1/4 inch square screen is useful here). Some suggest using strong-smelling chemicals like soap or mothballs to keep animals away, but these can leave a smell in the car.

, These are basically ""smart"" battery chargers that only turn on periodically. For short times, a few months, the maintainer can be attached to the battery while still in the car. For extended periods, if you are comfortable with basic mechanics, removing the battery and attaching the maintainer to it outside the car is a advisable. If you choose to do this, be sure to contact the car's manufacturer to ensure that this will not confuse the on-board computers, and that you have written down any needed access codes for devices such as the stereo or alarm.

, Better yet, remove the blades completely and store them in a warm place (perhaps beside the battery and carpets). If you remove the blades, be sure to pad the ends of the wiper arms, which can scratch the glass if inadvertently turned on. You can also leave the wipers in place and just wrap them with plain plastic wrap. This can be gently scrubbed from the window if it sticks. Alternatively, if your car has the windshield wiper arms that pop out and away from the windshield, you can store them in the ""out"" position

, Do this only if you are comfortable with basic mechanics. Special ""fogging oil"" is available for storing boats, and will work well here. Use of a spark plug anti-seize lubricant on the threads is always advisable, as to prevent the threads from sticking. It will make disassembly easier, when it's time to change the spark plugs. If you wish to pass on this procedure, there are fuel additives (non alcoholic) that can be added and then driven to coat upper engine parts.

, ""Extended"" in this case depends on the type of tires; bias-ply tires need to be jacked up sooner than radials, and high-profile sooner than low-profile. A ""classic"" car with fat bias-ply tires should be jacked up if stored for more than a month, a modern sports car with low-profile radials should be fine for a winter.

, If the brake is left on, the brake pads can stick to the rotors. Place chocks under the tires to prevent movement, which is even more effective than the brake, anyway.

, When returning to the car in the spring, ensure all of these steps are reversed, checking them off as you go down the list. The list should contain every item separately; ""rags in openings"" may lead to one being left behind.

, It will help in case someone tries to steal something from your car.

, Leaving the car ""open"" indoors allows water vapor to leave the car after humid weather.

Consider your safety first.,
Read the manual and make sure you understand the basics of your quadcopter.,
Start trying to fly in an open field.,
Begin with rotating the quadcopter, just spinning it around slowly.,
Fly forward, backward and sideways.,
Maintain a lower altitude.,
Move on to the more extreme maneuvers such as flips, rolls and loops once you have mastered the basics of flying!,
Practice landing.",How to Fly an RC Quadcopter," It is the very first and very crucial part of learning how to fly. As it is a flying machine, so you have to make sure that you are safe in every aspect of the process. Also, as the Quadcopter is expensive, thus you should also consider its safety.
, Get a feel for the transmitter and make sure you understand how everything works.

, If you are learning to fly a Quadcopter, then you must do this in an open field which should be distant from any power lines or buildings. Try flying away from vehicles, windows and other distractions. Some people prefer to fly their drones by tying them to a 4-5 feet string so that it will not fly away in any case.


If your quadcopter is small, a space such as an indoor basketball court will be just as good.

, Then try rotating the other way.

, You should now be able to turn the quadcopter while flying forward by giving forward inputs and rotating the quadcopter simultaneously. You will eventually be able to try banked turns (flying sideways, forward and rotating all at the same time.) Don't obsess over it if you crash, as it happens to even experienced flyers. The quadcopter shouldn't be too damaged if the crash was light, and parts are almost always readily available online or at your local hobby store.

, You have to maintain a lower altitude of your drone i.e. 1-2 feet above the ground. After that, you can slowly lift it up in the air to see its speed of reaching the height. Do it slowly so that you can have full control over it., Don't try these too soon, however, and make sure that you have a great feel for the machine and can fly it through basic maneuvers very well. Be patient with yourself and have fun!

, This is the obviously the last part of flying a drone. After the flight, use your controls according to the user manual given and land your drone safely without breaking anything. Nowadays, there are a few drones like Parrot Bebop in the market which comes back to their take off place automatically and land."
"
Gather needed materials.,
Find a safe spot.,
Take off.,
Take control of the drone.,
Take photos using the drone.,
Conserve battery.,
Return to base.,
Account for wind when bring drone to base.,
Slowly start to bring down the drone.,
Land carefully.,
Come to a complete rest.,
Return to shore and secure the boat.",How to Use a Drone on a Sailing Boat," Make sure the sailing boat is in the water and the drone is charged before proceeding to the next step.;
, Once the boat is sailing in the water, find a safe spot with no trees nearby.  Let the boat anchor down and prepare the drone.

, Power the drone on and wait for the drone to warm up. Once the drone is ready to fly, place it on the base of the sailboat. Make sure to find a flat surface to take off on as shown in the picture. Press ""takeoff"" and let the drone hover to a safe height.

, Make sure to have control of the drone by not letting it fly too high or too far away from the base (which in this case is the sailboat).

, By having water all around you this will be a perfect time to take scenic pictures and make interesting videos.

, Drones are known for short battery life, and wind will make that even shorter. Make sure to reserve enough battery to be able to bring the drone back to the base and be able to land it in moving conditions., There are multiple ways to bring the drone back to the base but the most easy way is to utilize the ""return to home"" feature. The drone will automatically have set the base as the same spot where it took off.This is standard on many drones.  By using this feature, the drone will return the takeoff location which from there can be landed., There will inevitably be wind. When the drone is going to descend make sure to account for any wind that will cause the drone to drift. If there is wind make sure to keep an eye on the battery percentage., When bringing the drone down make sure to keep it aligned with the surface of the boat. This is best done by manually controlling the drone., This is the most crucial part.  The drone should be descending somewhere over the boat.  If the boats anchor was not set properly the boat might have drifted a few feet.  If this is the case, adjust the position of the drone before landing., Once the drone has landed and is on a flat surface, shut the propellers off and secure the drone., Once the drone has been secured, remove the anchor and navigate the sailboat back to land. The photography can be edited or viewed at a later time.

Take some time to learn about who and what the Blue Angels are.,
Check the team schedule to see if they will be performing near your home.,
Consider visiting the home of the Blue Angels, Pensacola Naval Air Station, during the months of April through December, and you can watch their practice shows from the The Naval Aviation Museum, as well as enjoying the beaches of Florida's Emerald Coast.,
Be prepared for the long day of activities on the day of the airshow you choose to visit.,
Plan the route to the airshow site beforehand.,
Bring appropriate clothing for the weather conditions expected on the day of the show.,
Bring lightweight lawn chairs or seat cushions if you are unsure of available on-site seating.,
Consider bringing a good camera or video recorder to record the experience.,
Don't forget sunscreen, sunglasses, and hats on bright, sunny days.,
Protect your hearing during the show.,
Be prepared for a slow exodus from the show location.",How to View a Blue Angels Airshow," You can visit their official website at Angels.navy.mil, or just google the phrase Blue Angels. Here are a few facts that might interest you.


The Blue Angels fly F/A-18 Hornet Aircraft, a high-performance fight-attack jet designed to be flown from the deck of aircraft carriers.
There are 6 aircraft flown at airshows. Four aircraft fly formation maneuvers while the other two are considered solo planes, and do their own stunts either separately, or paired together.
A typical airshow flight plan lasts about 50 minutes. Cloudy weather or low visibility conditions can mean the team will fly a low altitude airshow, without the high loops and rolls they are famous for.;
, If not, consider planning your vacation at one of the sites they will be performing.

, At the Pensacola installation, you can view them practice twice a week, usually Tuesday and Thursday mornings with take-off around 8:30 AM from the viewing area of the National Museum of Naval Aviation, then the pilots come to the museum to sign autographs and answer questions.

, The Blue Angels perform about 69 shows each year, and last year, 13 million people watched them fly. Most airshows offer much more than just the Blue Angels, however. Static displays of modern and vintage military aircraft, guest stunt pilots in a variety of vintage airplanes, and even aircraft vs. ground vehicle races may be seen, depending on the show you attend.

, This step will vary depending on the venue at which the show is performed. Military installations usually decrease security on airshow days, but having basic identification and arriving early will ensure you are admitted to the base. Traffic can be a problem as well, and although the host of each show attempts to provide convenient parking and extra traffic control measures, and early arrival time will still make the trip more pleasant.

, Hot weather on an airfield in the summer can be miserable, and cold winds in the winter can feel like it is cutting you to the bone.

, Once the excitement of the actual Blue Angels performance begins, you will likely find yourself on your feet to get a better view, but you may expect several hours of other activities before and after the actual flight and being comfortably seated will certainly make the experience more enjoyable.

, Remember, however, that the action is very fast, so inexperienced photographers may find it difficult to capture it well on film.

, You won't often find shops or vendors selling these items at the airshow location, and even if they do, the prices will probably be higher than you could find elsewhere. Most, however, will have food vendors near the viewing grounds, and some do permit souvenir sales on the premises.

, One maneuver has all six hornets flying over at a low altitude and the sound of 12 General Electric turbo-fan engines producing tens of thousands of pounds of thrust can be deafening. Be especially careful about taking small children or persons who are sensitive to loud noises.

, Blue Angels performances often draw crowds comparable to large sporting events, but the venues they occur at are not usually designed for that type of traffic.

Call the phone number of the company and ask them about the flight in question.,
Look at the incoming flight's details on the flight board at the airport (if you are on the gates side of security, past the security checkpoint).,
Talk to the gate attendants at the airport gate your flight is supposed to meet at (if you are on the gates side of security, past the security checkpoint).,
Listen to control tower feeds of the airport either online (LiveATC.net is one of the more popular sites) or in the airport itself (if set up to host this information).",How to Track a Flight in Progress2," If you need the phone number, you'll potentially need the phone number for the company that can be found online or from other airline documentation.

Most airline flight miles portions of these airlines aren't set up to handle these transactions, but can give you the phone number to the company when asked.

, You can pretty much judge an approximate time of arrival., Most will be more than happy to explain approximately where the incoming plane is at that current time - but be careful as some won't give you too much of an update and if you are incessant they won't give you any update at all so be careful. While some airlines just tell their agents to relay their departure and arrival cities, some can look on their computer and see approximately where it is, and will tell you.

Be careful if they ask for additional payment to find out additional information about the flight.

, Some uncontrolled airports (those that don't have official control towers) have details that tell you which planes are nearby that can give you a clue to where these planes are and their estimated time of a arrival (ETA)."

,, Making sure that what you are doing is legal is essential. The rules vary region by region, so check your local drone/quad-copter regulations., Most people use 2.4ghz for control of the multi-rotor and so the only available legal frequency in the UK is 5.8ghz. It has a restriction though on power. The maximum for the TX is 25mw. This is ok if you have decent clover leaf antennas., Don't fly within five miles of an airport or near radio masts or power lines. Don't fly within 50 meters (160 ft) of any object or person that you don't have direct control over., This requires a license.

There are too many regulations to list, do a quick Google. The CAA govern all of this in the UK.

Purchase a book that has three dimensional view drawings and other information to help you identify aircraft.,
Bring the things you will need:


For the hobbyist/serious aircraft spotter: If you like, you can bring a camera so you can show off your discoveries on a website or just to keep and display in your home.,
Look for the basic identifying portions of the airplane.,
Check the type of engines.,
Look for the number and position of the engines.,
Check the wings.,
Check the tailplane.",How to Identify a Commercial Aircraft," If you're not sure if spotting is the hobby for you, check out a book at your local library before investing in purchasing one.;
,






For the casual spottee/person waiting for a flight at the airport: Since you probably didn't plan on having your flight delayed and you probably don't have a camera in your carry on, you are pretty much confined to observing, which is just fine.







, Since a good portion of the times you get a good look at aircraft, they are flying overhead, you may only have a few moments to lock vital information about the aircraft into your brain.

, Look for the type of engines. Decide between the following:


Jets; or
Propeller driven
Gliders are also a possibility (no engines, no propellers).

, These are as follows:

Wing mounted - Most jets and propeller driven aircraft have their engines wing mounted.
Fuselage mounted - The engines are attached to the fuselage at the back of the plane.
Nose mounted - The engines are attached to the fuselage, inside the nose of the aircraft. This is most common on single engine light aircraft.
Tail mounted - Not to be confused with fuselage mounted engines, tail mounted engines are actually in the tail.
Combination - Some aircraft such as the DC-10 and L-1011 have a combination. They have two-wing mounted engines and one tail mounted.

, Look at the position of the wings (if you are looking at an airliner and can't decide if the wings are low or mid, mid is your best bet).


High - In this configuration the wings are attached to the top of the fuselage.
Mid - Most commercial airplanes have this orientation. The wings appear to sprout just above the bottom of the fuselage.
Low - This is mostly found on small general aviation planes. The wings are connected to the fuselage at the base of the fuselage.

, The tailplane is the horizontal piece that sticks out of the tail.


High - Connects at the very top of the tail (the part that sticks straight up at the back of the plane).
Mid - In the middle of the tail.
Low - At the point where the tail connects to the fuselage.

Understand what the MDS designation tells you about the vehicle.,
Become familiar with the format.,
Read from the hyphen out to the left.,
Check the type of aircraft.,
Determine the basic mission.,
Find the modified mission.,
See if there is a status prefix.,
Look for the design number to the right of the hyphen.,
Review the series letter.,
Make note of any additional elements.,
Practice.",How to Understand US Military Aircraft Designations," The system consists of six different designations which identify:


the type of aircraft
the basic mission of the aircraft
the modified mission of the aircraft
the design number
the series letter
the status prefix;
, The order in which this designation is presented is actually (6)(3)(2)(1) - (4)(5).

, Then read everything after the hyphen, to the right.

, If it is anything other than an airplane (e.g. heavier than air, atmospheric craft) you will see one of the following symbols immediately to the left of the hyphen. Otherwise, skip to the next step.


D – UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) Control Segment; these are not the actual UAVs, but rather the manned aircraft controlling and, ""D,"" for Directing them)
G – Glider (including motor gliders used for unpowered flight; fixed wing; use air currents for normal lift; may have an engine)
H – Helicopter (any rotary wing aircraft)
Q – UAS (Unmanned Aerial System, this is the actual vehicle)
S – Spaceplane (can operate both within and outside the atmosphere; see Tips below)
V – VTOL/STOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing / or, Short distance TakeOff and Landing)
Z – Lighter than air (e.g. weather balloons, spy balloons, think of the old Zeppelins to remember the ""Z"" designator)

, The letter immediately to the left of the dash (when a type designation is not present) indicates the basic mission purpose of that aircraft. Occasionally, the basic mission designation is left out if the type and the modified mission (see next step) are included (e.g. MQ-9A).


A – Ground Attack (""A"" is from Attack)
B – Bomber
C – Transport (""C"" from Cargo mover)
E – Special Electronic Installation (""E"" stands for the addition of extensive Electronic equipment)
F – Fighter (air combat, think of the ""F"" for Fighting/dogFighting)
H - Search and Rescue (Think of the ""H"" as in Hospital, flying Hospital ships, and also the common destination for those who are rescued)
K – Tanker (think of the ""K"" in tanker or Kerosene, it carries and transfers aviation fuel--frequently a kerosene blend--in flight to other aircraft)
L – Laser-equipped (Laser weaponry against air and ground targets; a new designation)
M – Multi-mission (A wide variety of possible missions)
O – Observation (Observation of enemy or potential enemy positions)
P – ""P"" for Patrol, maritime (as in over the ocean)

NOTE: Prior to 1962's ""modernized"" designations, ""P"" was commonly used for WWI, WWII and Korean War ""Pursuit"" planes, the first fighter/interceptors


R – Reconnaissance (air reconnaissance of enemy forces, territory, and facilities)
S – Anti-Submarine (""S"" from enemy Submarines' search, locate, and attack; see Tips below)
T – Trainer
U – Utility (base support aircraft)
X – Special Research (""X"" from experimental design and developmental pure research programs, with no operational mission intended or feasible)

, The letter left of the basic mission designation indicates that a particular aircraft has been optionally modified for a mission different than its original design purpose. There should only be one letter for the modified mission designation, but there are a few exceptions (e.g. EKA-3B). These symbols are similar to the basic mission symbols, but contain a few extra descriptors.


A – Ground Attack
C – Transport (Cargo)
D – Drone Detector (modified to control unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones)

, If this symbol is present, it will be all the way to the left, and it is only needed if an aircraft is not in normal operational service.


C - Captive. Rockets and missiles that are incapable of launch.
D - Dummy. Non-flying rockets and missiles, usually for ground training.
G – Permanently Grounded. Usually for ground training of crews and support. Rare.
J – Special Testing, Temporary. Aircraft with equipment temporarily installed for testing.
N – Special Testing, Permanent. Aircraft with equipment installed for testing and that cannot be returned to original configuration.
X – Experimental. Aircraft not yet finalized or accepted for service.
Y – Prototype. Think of the ""Y"" in prototYpe, this is a final aircraft creation which is intended for mass production.
Z – Planning phase. In the planning/pre-development phase. Not for actual aircraft.

, The first number after the hyphen is an aircraft designation. The rule, although often violated, is that normal aircraft are to be designated in a strict numerical series according to their basic mission. The easiest examples are found in the Fighter class of US airplanes: F-14, then the F-15, F-16 and so on. But, there are exceptions. For example, the X-35, which was a research plane, was later redesignated the F-35 when it became fighter capable, even though the next number in the Fighter sequence was F-24.

, A suffix letter designates variants of a basic aircraft, with the first model being ""A"" and subsequent series letters being assigned the next letters of the alphabet (skipping ""I"" and ""O"" to avoid confusion with the numbers ""1"" and ""0""). As with other symbols, there are exceptions with out-of-sequence suffixes (e.g. to designate a specific customer, like the ""N"" in F-16N designated ""Navy"").

, There are three additional symbols which you may encounter, and which are optional. E.g. F-15E-51-MC Eagle, EA-6B-40-GR Prowler


Assigned popular name. ""Eagle"" and ""Prowler"" in the examples given.
Block number. Distinguishes between minor sub-variants of a specific aircraft variant. ""51"" and ""40"" in the examples above. Sometimes the hyphen before the block number is replaced by the word ""block"" (e.g. B-2A Block 30).
Manufacturer code letters. Identifies manufacturing plant. (See Sources and Citations section below to find a list of abbreviations.)

, Read the following MDS designations and see if you can figure them out. Answers are in the Tips below. Some designations can get more complicated, but if you start from hyphen and read outward to the left, you should be able to understand any US aircraft's designation.

Make a decision as to the extent of aircraft that you might like to ""spot"".,
Understand what is usually involved in aircraft spotting.,
Get some good gear.,
Take a buddy.,
Prepare yourself for an aircraft spotting trip.,
Start spotting.,
Record your experiences once back at home.,
Decide how far you want to take your new hobby.,
Consider joining a club or association that supports and promotes aircraft spotting.,
Be useful.",How to Be an Aircraft Spotter," Although the often used term ""plane spotting"" refers to airplanes, the preferred term is ""aircraft spotting"" because you can observe and record any number of flying craft and not just airplanes. For example, helicopters, gliders, balloons, airships, and microlights can be included if wished.You might want to narrow the choices if you live somewhere that has an incredible amount of air traffic, such as London, Chicago, Frankfurt, etc., or you might want to include a wider range of aircraft if you're living in the middle of empty airspace where aircraft arrivals are not so frequent, such as the country, outback, or the Arctic region. It's really up to your time availability and personal interests.


Start by doing some background research on aircraft spotting websites. There are many sites dedicated to aircraft spotting, from the amateur blog to the professional club-sponsored site, and they can all open up new ideas for your hobby. When searching for online information about aircraft spotting, also use the term ""plane spotting"", as it is used frequently as well.
When looking for information online, also look for airports, aircraft manufacturers, airline information, flight pathways, etc., as these will provide you with a great deal of useful background information. You can limit the search to your own country, or check different sites from all around the world.Keep in mind that aviation photography is a hobby in its own right, and dovetails perfectly with aircraft spotting. So, if anyone questions your interest, you can always justify it by explaining that you are an aviation photography hobbyist as well!;
, Although you are free to spot aircraft in any way that pleases you, there are some standard practices that aircraft spotters tend to follow. In order to work out the type of aircraft, there are many indicators that assist the aircraft spotter in working this out. In addition, even where the type of plane is evident, there ares still many other elements worth noting, including country of origin, age, and any special modifications. Things to note as an aircraft spotter include:Noting the type of plane. Its make, size, colors, and country of origin can all be of interest.
Noting the plane's registration details. This might enable you to discern the delivery or launch dates of the particular aircraft, depending how much detail you want to go into.
Noting any interesting artwork or insignia features on a plane (for example, some airlines like Qantas paint the tail wing, or the whole aircraft, using special artwork from renowned artists on certain planes). For military aircraft, camouflage markings are important and these will differ from country to country. There might also be squadron badges and code letters.
Noting engine noise, vapor trails.
Placement of wings - is it a monoplane, biplane, or triplane. How are the wings placed in relation to the fuselage, and how much do they sweep rearwards?
Is it a recent aircraft, or a vintage model?
Noting whether it has retractable wheels or a fixed undercarriage. Or is it a seaplane?
Noting the speed.
Noting cockpit placement.
Noting the landing or take-off pattern of the plane.

, Here is your excuse to indulge in good quality gear guaranteed to enhance your aircraft spotting experience. Some items to consider include:


Decent binoculars - for checking out incoming aircraft angles, for noting registration numbers, marks and details, for outdoing your mate at seeing things first, good binoculars are a must. You can also purchase a ""spotting scope"" instead of binoculars, if preferred.

Digital camera, plus telescope lens, tripod, etc. - for photographic records of the aircraft you have spotted. This is especially important if you are keeping a personal digital album record of your spots, or if you're contributing your spots to a website.
Fold-up chair, thermos flask, snack container, rug and warm clothing if cold, sunscreen and hat if hot, snacks and drinks - it's important to be comfortable and to keep well hydrated and fed!
Manuals or guides if you want to work out what the aircraft is. You will need to consider both commercial aircraft manuals or guides and military aircraft manuals or guides unless you're not likely to see military aircraft, in which case, only commercial aircraft manuals will be needed. Ask at your local library or look online - some online auction sites can be a good source of such manuals, or sites dedicated to aircraft spotting.
A dedicated notebook and decent all-weather pens for writing down the information you glean from spotting. A weatherproof notebook available from camping stores is a good idea.
A safety jacket. While not essential, if you are able to spot somewhere that could potential be hazardous for you if you're not seen, consider getting a safety jacket. This might be useful even if your only hazardous element is crossing a very busy main road to get to your spotter's paradise.

, It's a lot more fun if you're doing this with someone you know and who appreciates your enthusiasm for aircraft spotting too. If you have a buddy, both of you can chat and set up your own spotting competitions between you. Take walkie-talkies and sit in different locations to see who can spot the registration first. Award yourself points, with the winner or loser shouting a meal or drink after the day's spotting, depending on how you like to play it!

, Initially, it is a good idea to team up with somebody who has already done aircraft spotting so that they can take you to the best places and give you pointers throughout the session. If not, look online, or ask around, to find suitable places to go aircraft spotting. Some airports or aviation associations are very helpful and suggest spotting places for enthusiasts.Always consider safety first. Don't go where you're not allowed. There are strict rules about getting too close to airports, even if they're not fenced off. On the whole, those rules are for your own safety but they're also about security, particularly in more security conscious countries.
Set up your spotting area with consideration for existing spotters. If you are somewhere used traditionally for spotting, it's probably not wise to just assume it's OK to sit just anywhere. Ask for advice from the other spotters and they'll usually be very happy to make suggestions for you.

, If you've already worked out from the previous steps what you're looking for, then start observing for those elements as you're spotting. Otherwise, you might to ease yourself into the aircraft spotting experience by simply observing everything initially and deciding from this experience which elements interest you most. This is why it can be helpful to have someone already well versed in spotting nearby, to give you hints and guidance so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the initial spotting experience.

, While on your outing, you will be taking notes and photos which will need sorting once back home. Plan to set aside some time to tidy up, collate and reference your findings. This might include:


Selecting the best aircraft photos for uploading to a website.
Noting significant features or things of interest that you saw during the aircraft spotting exercise.
Tallying up the aircraft spotted.
Marking down the aircraft you've not spotted before, as well as making notes of aircraft you still would like to be able to check off in the future.

, There are many possibilities and some of them may be more appealing than others. For starters, it is a good idea to consider how you feel about the following ideas as forming a part of your hobby, or not, as the case may be:


Competing with other aircraft spotters. This can include joining a club or association and aiming to spot all types of aircraft in a class that is determined by the club or association.
Creating your own website and uploading your photos of spots onto it, along with commentary.

Uploading your photos of spots onto one of the many aircraft spotting websites already online. This can be a combination of competition and hobby if wished, or just serve as a source of displaying your photos as wished. If you do this, be sure to keep note of the date, time, and place of your spot, as many sites record the ""last spot"" of each aircraft as a way of keeping track of the aircraft for all interested viewers.
Joining spotting mail lists. There are a number of these that you can join to be kept informed.There are now also Twitter accounts you can follow to keep up with spotting information.Find out if your local club or association, or your favorite aircraft spotting websites, have Twitter accounts that you can follow.
Broadening your hobby to include what are ""ancillary activities"", such as listening to air traffic transmissions (this can be done using radio scanners but only where it is legal to do so).
Packing your bags and getting on a plane to go and spot more planes somewhere else in the world. If you have spent time cultivating friendships with other aircraft spotting enthusiasts around the world, this can be a fun and exciting way to make holiday plans and to make new friends. There are plenty of sites dedicated to explaining where the best places for aircraft spotting are to be found around the world. Just be understanding that if you drag along the family though, they're unlikely to want to spend their holiday pursuing your passion, so have something more interesting planned for them!
Visiting aviation museums around the world. This can also be adding to your aircraft spotting records, as you check off vintage and famous aircraft from different parts of the world.

, A hobby is always a lot more fun when you share it with other like-minded enthusiasts and being part of an excited and active group is a great way to give real life to your hobby experience. For example, you can join the LAAS International as an aircraft enthusiast. , As your hobby continues, if you notice anything that you believe should be passed on to airport officials, then be helpful and do so. This doesn't mean being a nuisance and trying to suppose you know their job better than they do, but some things that could be helpful include:


Alerting airport officials if you notice any bird nesting or animal breeding activities near the airport or on it. Birds and animals can be a hazard for aircraft and it's a good idea to let airport officials know in case they haven't realized.
Alerting airport officials if you notice any strange activities, or security breaches such as broken fences, etc. Don't be a vigilante though - just things that might be out of the ordinary. For example, in the UK there is a code of conduct in place for aircraft spotters introduced by aviation enthusiasts' club LAAS International, under which aircraft spotters are encouraged to report suspicious behavior.

Assess the size and location of the dent.,
Purchase a clean plunger.,
Moisten the rubber edge on the plunger.,
Position the plunger over the dent and press into the vehicle.,
Pull out on the plunger repeatedly.",How to Repair Minor Dents1," Using a plunger to remove a dent works best on large, shallow dents in flat components of the body like the door or hood. Whether you use a toilet plunger or an automotive one designed for dent pulling, no plunger can remove creases from steel, they can only pop dents back out.If the dent is smaller than a quarter, a plunger likely will not resolve it.
The flatter the body panel, the better the plunger method will work.;
, You can actually use a toilet plunger with a similar level of effectiveness for this method as you can a dent removing plunger purchased from an auto parts store. Plungers designed for dent removal may have a higher success rate with more difficult dents.Use a clean plunger to avoid getting any kind of debris on the paint of your vehicle.
Automotive plungers are often quite a bit more expensive than toilet plungers.

, Use a bit of water and a rag to moisten the suction surface of the plunger. This will allow it to create a seal against the vehicle, which will enable you to pull up on the plunger to suck the metal back into shape.Make sure to use clean, plain water to avoid damaging the paint.

, If the dent is larger than the circumference of the plunger, start on the edges of the dent. If it is smaller than the plunger, place the plunger directly over the dent. Press the plunger into the vehicle.You may need to repeat the process from multiple angles on larger dents.
When placing the plunger along the side of the dent, ensure the plunger is over both the dented and undented area.

, Pull backward on the plunger in short, jerking motions just as you might when plunging a toilet. The plunger may pop off before the dent is removed, so prepare yourself to re-moisten the plunger and start again.It may take multiple tries to suck a dent back out of the metal.
Short, quick motions will yield the best results when sucking dents out of steel.

"
"
Assess the angle of the dent.,
Put on safety glasses and gloves.,
Use tongs to place a bit of dry ice on the dent.,
Allow the dent to interact with the ambient air.,
Repeat the process as necessary.",How to Repair Minor Dents2," Dry ice needs to be applied to the dent for a short time in order to effectively remove it, so it may work best on horizontal surfaces such as the hood, roof or trunk lid of the vehicle. If the dent is on the side, you will need to hold the dry ice in place with tongs.You can purchase dry ice at many large retail stores or at office supply stores.
Dry ice works best on medium sized dents and may be less effective on large ones.

, Always wear safety glasses and heavy duty gloves when handling dry ice. Because of the extreme temperatures involved, coming into contact with dry ice on bare skin could seriously hurt you.Large rubber gloves and goggle style glasses are required for this project.
Do not open the dry ice package until you have adequate safety gear in place.

, Use a pair of long metal tongs to remove a chunk of dry ice and apply it directly to the dent. If the dent is on a horizontal surface, you may place the dry ice on it, otherwise you will need to hold it there. Allow the dry ice to contact the metal for thirty seconds to a minute before removing it again.Be sure that if you are going to hold the dry ice in place that you use tongs and wear gloves to prevent ice burns.
Do not leave the dry ice on the paint for longer than a minute or it may damage it.

, After you remove the dry ice from the metal, the warmth from the ambient air will interact with the extreme cold created by the ice. This interaction will cause the metal to shift and pop out the dent.The intense cold will cause the metal to retract then expand again as it warms.
This shift in temperature may pop the dent out.

, Depending on the size and severity of the dent, you may need to apply the dry ice and allow it to warm again multiple times to remove the dent entirely. Repeat the process until the dent is gone.Allow the metal to reach normal temperature again before re-applying dry ice.
Pay attention to the clear coat on the metal. If it begins to crack, stop applying dry ice immediately.

"
Assess the location of the dent.,
Remove body components as necessary.,
Locate the backside of the dent.,
Apply pressure to the back of the dent.,
Use a wooden mallet covered in a cloth to bang on the dent.",How to Repair Minor Dents3," Some dents are best accessed from behind. This is especially true for dents with very small diameters that are difficult to remove with other methods. Determine if the dent you intend to remove is located somewhere you can access by removing components of the body.You will likely need to remove body components to access a dent from behind.
Determine if you can gain access to the dent based on the tools you have on hand and your level of expertise in removing and replacing body panels.

, Once you have identified what components of the body you will need to remove to gain access to the dent, lay down blankets on the ground for any painted pieces you will need to remove. You may also need to replace mud guards from the bottom of the vehicle, tail or headlights or the wheels.Be careful not to lose any of the hardware used to fasten the body components to the vehicle that you remove.
Never lay painted components down on blacktop without a blanket or something to protect the paint.

, Once you are able to access the back side of the dent, jack up the car if need be and find the dent from the inside. You may need a flashlight in order to see the inside of the dent.Locate the dent and position yourself so you can reach it.
You may need to try multiple positions in order to apply the leverage you need to the dent.

, For larger dents, you may be able to apply pressure to the inside with your hands to pop the dent back out. Dents with smaller diameters may require that you press into them with a harder surface such as the handle to a hammer.Attempt to press the dent back out before resorting to using a mallet.
There is less chance of damaging the metal by applying pressure than there is in striking at it with a mallet.

, Wrap a cloth around the head of a wood mallet to soften the striking surface, then hit the inside of the dent with the mallet. You may need to hit the dent repeatedly in order to knock it back out.Be careful not to bang on the interior metal from an angle or the side of the mallet may create small creases in the metal.
Do not continue to hammer on the metal after the dent pops out or you could cause the metal to bow outward slightly.

Plug the glue gun in.,
Choose the pulling tab best suited for the dent.,
Apply glue to the tab, then place the tab in the center of the dent.,
Attach the pulling mechanism to the tab.,
Turn the knob until the dent pops out.,
Remove the glue with isopropyl alcohol.",How to Repair Minor Dents4," Glue based dent pullers use traditional glue guns to heat the glue before applying it to the vehicle. You will need to plug the gun in a few minutes before you start in order to heat the gun up enough to melt the glue.


Be sure to use an extension cord that can reach the vehicle for the glue gun.
You will need to re-wax the vehicle after using this method.

, Using a glue based dent remover kit purchased from an auto parts store, choose the tab that best fits the dent you are trying to pull. Usually, you want to use a tab that fits entirely within the dent so it pulls directly from the center point.


Follow the directions in your dent pulling kit so help you determine which tab is right for your application.

, Apply a dab of hot glue to the tab of your choice, then quickly place the tab, glue side down, in the center of the dent. Hold the tab in place for a moment to allow the glue to set.


It’s okay if some of the glue squeezes out the sides of the tab when you apply it.
Hold the tab in place until the glue dries enough to hold itself up.

, Slide the pulling mechanism bracket over the tab with the two posts on either side of the dent. If the kit came with multiple brackets, ensure you use one that is longer than the diameter of the dent so the posts are at least a half inch from the start of the dent on either side.


The posts need to be outside the dent in order to pull the dent out.
If the bracket is not wider than the dent, this method will not work for you.

, Place the knob on the end of the tab that’s glued to the center of the dent. Turn the knob clockwise to tighten it, drawing the glued tab toward the bracket and pulling the metal with it. Continue to turn the knob until the dent pops out.


The glue may give way as you turn the knob. If this occurs, remove the old glue and begin the process again.
You may need to repeat this method on more than one spot to remove the entire dent.

, Peel any loose glue off with your fingers, then use rubbing alcohol to help remove any glue or residue remaining. This will likely remove the wax, and possibly even the clear coat from your paint, so be sure to apply a fresh coat of wax as soon as possible.


The glue and the alcohol are both harsh on paint, so be sure to wash and wax the vehicle after using them.

"
"
Determine the severity of the chip.,
Purchase a touch up paint pen.,
Clean the area around the chip.,
Use the paint pen to fill the chip.,
Allow the paint to dry then wash and wax the car.",How to Repair Car Paint Chips1," Chips in the paint of your car can be classified into one of three categories: small, medium and large. Small chips tend to be smaller than a dime and require less work to address. Medium chips are larger than a dime, but smaller than a quarter and large chips include chips in your paint that are as large or even larger than a quarter. Other things that can make a chip more difficult to repair include rust and flaking paint.Small chips should be free of rust and smaller than a dime.
Flaking paint requires the removal of the loose paint, which will make it larger than a “small chip” for repair purposes.;
, Unlike scratches, which can often be buffed or wet sanded out, a chip in your paint will require that you apply new paint to the metal. The paint on your car does more than simply make it look good, it also protects the metal beneath it from the elements. If the metal is exposed to air and moisture for too long, it will begin to oxidize and rust. Using touch up paint can help you prevent rust and with the wide variety of options available, it should be easy to find one that matches your car exactly. Touch up pens are designed specifically for small chips and can be very easy to use.Check on the sticker inside the door of all vehicles made after 1983 for a paint code. If the code for paint is not clearly labeled, take a picture of the sticker to show the clerk at your local auto parts store so they can find the code.
Some stores may ask for the Vehicle Identification Number (or VIN) for your vehicle to ensure they can find an exact match for your paint. Your VIN can also be found on the sticker inside your door.

, Before you can do any painting, it’s important that you wash the area thoroughly. Painting over things like dirt can ruin the appearance of the final product and it may fall off, revealing the chip once again. Rinse the area of the car, then wash it with warm soap and water before rinsing it again and then drying it well.Make sure the car is completely dry before applying any paint.

, Once the car is completely dry, remove the cap of the paint pen and place the point of the pen in the center of the chip. Depending on the type of paint pen you are using, you may need to press the pen down slightly to release the paint. You may not need to move the pen to fill a small chip, as the paint will be released and should fill the space needed, but move the pen from side to side a bit if you need to release more. Use enough paint to over-fill the chip slightly, as the paint will shrink a little as it dries.Do not apply enough paint to allow it to drip. The paint color will match, but things like drips will stand out.
If you accidentally apply too much paint, wipe off the excess immediately and thoroughly.

, Make sure the paint dries completely before washing the car, as you can easily scrape or damage the new paint while it is still tacky. Depending on the type of paint pen and how much paint you used, it may take only an hour or so to dry completely, but may require as much as a full day. Once the paint is completely dry, wash the entire car and then apply a fresh coat of wax.Touch the paint lightly to determine if it is dry. If it feels sticky at all, it isn’t dry yet.
Applying a new coat of wax will help make the car’s paint appear uniform in color and glossiness, as well as helping to protect the paint from further chips.

"
"
Remove any debris.,
Wash the area around the chip.,
Use rubbing alcohol to remove grease and oil.,
Apply primer to the metal.,
Apply touch up paint by dabbing the applicator brush.,
Allow the paint to dry and re-apply if necessary.,
Wash and wax the vehicle.",How to Repair Car Paint Chips2," Medium sized chips tend to be between the size of a dime and a quarter. Because of their increased size, it isn’t uncommon for small amounts of debris to get stuck in the chip or to the paint on the borders of the chip. Remove small debris with your fingers or a pair of tweezers before washing the area of the vehicle. If you attempt to wash it first, the sponge could catch small bits of debris and drag it through the rest of the good paint, causing small scratches.Using tweezers can help you to get small bits of debris that may be caught in the paint before you move on to washing the vehicle.
Sometimes blowing on the area or using canned air can free up and dispel small bits of debris.
Ensure none of the paint is flaking off as you remove the debris. Flaking paint may lead to a large chip.

, Once the chip and surrounding area are free from debris, wash that part of your car just as you would for a small chip. First rinse the area, then apply warm soapy water with a sponge before rinsing it again. Ensure the car is completely dry before applying any paint.Washing the area also ensures there is no debris or sediment that may get trapped by the new layers of paint.

, Once the area around the chip is clean and dry, put some rubbing alcohol, Prepsol or enamel reducer on a rag and use that to clean the chipped area once again. This will remove any grease or oils in the area that may make it difficult for the primer to establish a strong bond to the metal. You likely won’t be able to see any oil or grease, but it does not need to be visible to compromise the painting process.Simply rub the rag on the chip itself and around the edges of it.
Remember that this will remove wax and even clear coat from the remaining paint, so avoid scrubbing the painted area. Instead simply rub the chip lightly.

, Automotive primer can be purchased at your local auto parts store as well as at many large retailers like Walmart or Target. The primer will come in a small bottle with a brush, unlike the paint pen used for smaller chips. Use the applicator brush to apply the primer to the dry, clean metal, taking care to get very little of it on the paint surrounding it. Use only enough primer to cover the unpainted area with a thin, but solid coat.While you will be painting over the primer, applying it to the paint around the chip will raise the height of the paint in that area, creating a blemish in the paint you will be able to see.
Ensure you don’t use more primer than is necessary. Immediately wipe off and thoroughly clean any drips.
Make sure the primer dries completely before moving on to the next step. If it feels sticky, it isn’t dry yet.

, Medium and large sized chips require touch up paint that has an applicator brush instead of the pen. While the paint is the same, the method used to apply it is slightly different. For medium sized chips on the smaller side, a paint pen may still do the trick. Shake the touch up paint thoroughly, then dip just the tip of the applicator brush into it. Dab the applicator brush in the center of the chip and move it around slightly, allowing the paint to stick to the metal and expand. Dip the brush in again, then touch it to the paint in the same area, allowing the paint to flow off of the applicator brush and settle on the vehicle, instead of stroking it on as you might when painting a house.It may take a number of dabs to fill the chip, but doing it in this manner allows the paint to settle evenly.
Fight the urge to apply more paint to expedite the process. Adding too much paint at a time can result in dripping or bubbling.

, Once the touch up paint has dried, evaluate the result. If the paint has sufficiently filled the chip and the sides of the touch up paint have become flush with the surrounding paint, you are ready to move on to the next step. If the touch up paint settles slightly lower than the surrounding paint or some metal is still visible, apply another coat of paint by dabbing it on the chip just as you did previously.The paint may look raised above the surrounding dry paint as you dab it. It will shrink as it dries, allowing it to flatten out.
Patience during this process will ensure you end up with the best possible final product.
Ensure the touch up paint is completely dry before moving on to the next step (it may take a number of hours).

, Although you only painted one small portion of the vehicle, it’s important to wax the entire vehicle at the same time to ensure the glossiness of the paint matches throughout. Wax protects your paint from the elements and from sun-caused fading, so failing to apply new wax to the entire car could result in the paint fading into slightly different shades. You will need to apply wax to the newly painted area in order to protect the new paint as well as to make the glossiness of it match the rest of the car.Make sure to wash and wax your entire car to protect the paint and ensure the levels of glossiness match.

Assess the damage.,
Use tweezers or a dental pick to remove debris and chips.,
Remove any surface rust.,
Sand the edges of the chip.",How to Repair Car Paint Chips3," A large paint chip is usually the size of a quarter or even larger. Large chips can be the most difficult to repair because the area that you will need to repaint will be more visible. If the chip reaches a few inches in diameter or continues to flake into a larger and larger chip, you will probably need a body shop to repaint the entire body component or even the whole car. Make sure the paint damage is something you can handle with touch up paint before beginning.Touch up paint should only be used on chips in your paint that are smaller than a few inches in diameter.
Do not attempt to apply paint over existing paint that is chipping, as it will flake off and ruin the repair.

, Larger chips are more apt to accumulate debris that you must remove before moving on to the next step. Use your fingers or tweezers to remove any large debris and try blowing on the area or using canned air to remove any sediment. Large chips may result in the surrounding paint flaking. Make sure to remove the paint that flakes, as it is no longer bonded to the metal and will eventually come off anyway – taking your new touch up paint with it. You can use your fingernails, tweezers or a dental pick to remove flakes.Be careful not to remove any good paint from the area surrounding the chip when removing flakes.
Make sure you don’t scratch the good paint with any tools you are using to remove flakes or debris.

, Because large chips expose more metal to moisture, there is an increased risk of rust. Remove rust by applying some CLR to a Q-tip and swabbing the metal. If the rust has penetrated deep enough to create a hole through the door or your Q-Tip penetrates the metal, it means the rust has ruined the body component and cannot be repaired by simply painting over it. A body shop can determine if rust of that magnitude can be removed and repaired or if you will need to replace that component of the body of the car. If there is no deep penetration of rust, simply apply the CLR with different Q-tips until they start coming up clean.Once the Q-tips start coming up clean, wipe the area you applied the CLR to with rubbing alcohol to remove the chemical and any grease or oil that may remain.
Failing to completely remove the rust will result in the new paint you apply flaking off with bits of rust.
Stopping the progress of rust can prevent you from having to pay for expensive repairs to the body of your car in the future.

, Use fine grit sandpaper (2000 grit should suffice without causing further scratches) to round off the edges of the paint around the chip to reduce visibility of the repair. Hard defined paint edges surrounding a large chip can make the repair obvious to the naked eye, but by rounding off the edges you can help the new paint blend with the old more effectively. Do not wet the sandpaper as you might when wet-sanding automotive paint, as this can cause rust to begin to form on the bare metal. Instead use dry sandpaper and replace it often as the paper becomes clogged with paint.Gluing pieces of sand paper to small craft sticks or dowels can help you to control the angle in which you sand, but it is not necessary to complete this step.
Sand the edges of the chip until they are rounded off and less distinct to the naked eye.
Wash the area after sanding it to remove any new sediment.

Apply the primer.,
Wet sand the primer.,
Apply the touch up paint to the primer.,
Wet sand the newly dried paint.,
Apply clear coat.,
Wash and wax the entire car.",How to Repair Car Paint Chips4," Once the chip is sanded, clean and dry you can apply the primer just like you would on a medium sized chip. Apply a thin layer of primer to any bare metal using the applicator brush. Be careful not to apply so much primer that drips begin to form, as they could reach the paint or cause the final repair to look uneven.Allow the primer to dry completely before moving on to the next stage.
It may take several hours for the primer to dry to full “cure.” Read the label on the automotive primer you purchased to know for sure.

, Once the primer is dry, it may appear to be textured due to the bristles of the brush or the way it settled on the metal. Use 2000 grit sandpaper and a hose to wet sand the primer. Turn the house on and hold it above the chip so the water is pouring directly onto the dry primer, then use the sand paper to lightly sand only the primer. Be careful not to sand the clear coat or paint from the surrounding area as you lightly sand the primer until it is completely flat.Wet sanding the primer will help ensure it takes on a completely flat and even finish.
Allow the sanded primer to dry again completely before moving on to the next step.

, Using the same method as you might for a medium sized chip, apply the touch up paint to the primer. Dab the applicator brush in the paint, then touch it to the center of the chip and allow the paint to settle evenly. Repeat this process until the paint covers the entire primed area. You may need to apply multiple coats, or one coat could suffice depending on the touch up paint you purchase.Allow the paint to dry completely before determining if you should apply another coat.
If you attempt to apply the paint before the primer has dried from the wet sanding, grey swirls could appear in the paint.

, Once the paint is completely dry, repeat the wet sanding process on the fresh paint to remove any texture and make it completely flat. Make sure to use different extremely fine sandpaper (2000 grit or more) and keep the water flowing over the paint as you sand it to prevent doing damage to the newly repaired area. Dry sanding will result in scratches in the paint.If you make a mistake or identify an issue with the paint during the wet sanding, allow it to dry completely and then apply more touch up paint.
Sand the area lightly until it is completely flat and even with the surrounding area.

, Some touch up paint will come with a small container of clear coat, but you may need to purchase it separately. Clear coat is lacquer based and should be applied in a thin coat over the fresh paint using the supplied brush applicator. A small, fine bristled paint brush will also suffice. Apply the clear coat to the new paint; this will both protect the paint and provide a healthy shine that you will further blend with the surrounding paint with wax in the following step.Apply the clear coat by painting a thin layer of it to the new paint.
The freshly painted chip may still be slightly visible to you as you complete the clear coat, but remember that it will be difficult to see if you aren’t too close.
Allow the clear coat to dry completely before moving on.

, Once the repaired area is completely dry, wash and wax the entire car to ensure the wax is evenly distributed. Waxing the car will further blend the freshly painted area with the surrounding paint and make the repair even less noticeable. You may want to wait a few days before waxing to ensure the repaired layers of clear coat, paint, and primer are all completely dry so you don’t run any risk of damaging the new paint in the process.You may want to repair any other chips you intend to fix before waxing the vehicle.

Gently rub the surface of the trim.",How to Remove Old Car Wax1," Remove any surface dirt from the car's exterior by washing it using a non-drying soap and water. Dry it clean with soft cotton towels or by allowing it to air dry. By removing as much dirt from the surface as possible, you allow the chemicals in the pre-wax cleaner to get directly to the layer of wax instead of having to contend with layers of grime and gunk first.;
, Strictly speaking, a spray on wax remover is a more legitimate pre-wax cleaner.


Spray on wax removers strip the wax off a car but do not do much else. They do not clean deep and do not remove contaminants that lurk below the surface. However, because they do not cleanse deeply, they make a good choice for someone who likes to frequently strip old wax and apply new wax.
Non-abrasive polishes cleanse a little more deeply. They are used for less frequent strippings and clean dirt that settles beneath the surface of the paint. Their primary purpose is not to remove wax, but that is a secondary effect.

, Apply the cleaner liberally, but make sure that you only get it on the paint of the car and not the plastic or rubber trim. If allowed to soak into plastic or rubber, wax removers have the tendency to discolor., Use a soft terry cloth to wipe the wax remover along the paint using side to side and top to bottom motions. Spread the wax remover using long, even strokes.

, If your first application of wax remover did not remove all the wax, you may apply another coating. Avoid repeating this too often, however, since too many applications on unprotected paint can gradually start to damage the point.

, Since plastic and rubber can become discolored when you use wax removers, a milder all-purpose car exterior cleanser is a better option. Apply the cleaner directly onto a clean terry cloth rag.

, Apply light, even pressure along the trim to remove as much of the old wax as possible.

Slide the clay bar along the moistened area.,
Use additional clay lubricant to remove clay residue.,
Tidy the area with a microfiber towel.,
Repeat the process only if necessary.,
Clean the entire car in the same manner.",How to Remove Old Car Wax2," It is best to remove surface dirt from the paint before using the clay bar. The amount of dirt particles being picked up by the bar will be reduced, thereby allowing the bar to pick up more of the wax.

, You should use the clay bar on an area that is no bigger than 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters). This way, you can focus on each area more thoroughly, leading to more even removal.

, Some clay bars come with clay lubricant, but sometimes, you may need to purchase it separately. A clay lubricant creates a smooth surface for the clay bar to pass over, making it easier for the clay to glide along the surface of the car without leaving pieces behind.The lubricant should be misted onto the paint evenly.

, Wipe from side to side or top to bottom, but apply a gentle pressure either way, allowing the clay to do the majority of the work. You may actually be able to hear the clay picking up wax and various contaminants. The clay bar will resist at first, but this is normal and acceptable as long as no clay is being left behind.


Continue sweeping the area until the clay bar no longer sticks. The wax is completely removed once the clay bar can slide across the surface without any resistance.

, If any clay pieces did break off and stick to the paint, spraying them with clay lubricant should make it easier to wipe them away., Remove any excess lubricant and clay particles with a clean terry cloth rag.

, Lightly rub the paint with your fingers. If it feels smooth, the clay bar did its job. If not, you may need to repeat the process once more, focusing on any areas that still feel rough.

, Continue working in 2x2 feet (61x61 centimeters) sections until all the wax has been stripped.

Yes it can be a ball bearing, a needle bearing or a bronze bushing. It is simply pressed into the end of the crank shaft. Without the aid of a special puller, you can pop it out with just a small amount of thick grease, a wooden dowel and a hammer.
, Using a flat blade screwdriver or other utensil, insert the thick grease, like that used on wheel bearings, into the cavity behind the pilot bearing. Make sure that the space is completely full of grease without any air gaps., Make or buy a wooden dowel that is the same diameter as the opening in the center of the bearing. It must fit snuggly or this trick won’t work.

With the cavity behind the bearing filled completely with grease, place the dowel into the opening keeping it perpendicular with the bearing. Using a hammer or mallet strike the wooden dowel with a quick hard blow. The bearing should have moved outward a noticeable amount and in some cases will have popped out completely.
You may have to add more grease to the cavity and repeat the operation, but it will come out. This is because the grease will not compress and the pressure exerted on the wooden dowel is transferred through the grease to the back of the bearing pushing it out.

, Press in the new bearing or bushing, reassemble the clutch system and install the transmission."

, If you're using sandpaper, push only with your index finger. If you're using a sanding sponge, or block, then only use a corner. Use moderate and controlled pressure. The goal is to remove the rust, not damage the metal underneath.
, Don't sand away metal or paint unless it is necessary to remove the rust.

,, If you still see rust, repeat sanding and wiping until the rust is gone. If you wind up with uneven spots or even holes in your metal, consider applying auto body putty to even out the area. Let the putty dry. Sand until smooth and the entire area is even.

Remove the axle bearings using the bearing replacement








Some of axle bearing removal tools can by used without the need of an impact wrench or power drill, but others do mandate it.",How to Remove Axle Bearings," You are going to have to raise your car up off of the ground in order to remove the axle bearings, but you must never attempt to do so on uneven ground. You need a flat, stable surface. The relatively even concrete surface of a garage floor may be ideal; an angled driveway is not.






;
, While this is useful to prevent the wheels from moving as you raise the vehicle, it is even more important later when you will remove the bearings.








,









There are several different types of car jacks, each of which work a little differently. The vast majority--including those that each car is typically equipped with--convert the user's force (applied a handle) to extend the head of the jack. As it extends, it will make contact with and then push whatever is in contact with the head.
The most important thing regarding use of a jack (after finding a flat surface) pertains to placement of the jack. Most vehicle manuals will tell you where the jack must be placed, so read it. If the jack applies pressure in the wrong place, it can damage a door, tear wires, or punch a hole through a fluid tank.

, If you are going to get under a vehicle (as you must while performing this job), jack stands are highly recommended over regular car jacks. Jacks tend to be fairly narrow and somewhat unstable, and so are more suitable for quick tire changes. To use a car jack for this task is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted.








The jack stand must be placed under the car frame itself. You cannot place the stand under a fuel or oil tank or other weak spot; the weight of the car will destroy them. Obviously, though, for this job keep them clear from the area of the axles. (See more here.)
Raise all 4 wheels of the car. This will ensure safety and precision in removing axle bearings. If you only raise 1 wheel or 1 side of the car, you run the risk of the car falling if it becomes unbalanced.

,









Remove the engine tray (also known as the under tray) if applicable. This rests under the engine, and will usually obstruct your access to the axle. (Note, some vehicles do not have this, and others have had it removed and never replaced.)
Remove the transmission tray.
Remove any plastic covering that rests over the suspension wishbone.

, You will not have access to the axle bearings without first removing the tires. You will probably want to replace more than one axle bearing at a time (after all, if one is worn out then the other on that same axle probably will be soon as well), so remove all of the appropriate tires. (For more, see here)








, The caliper is the device that squeezes the brake pads against the disk rotor (for the common disk brake). They should just be bolted in place, so remove the bolts. 








The caliper is connected to break lines. These apply the hydraulic pressure that makes the calipers work. There is no need to detach the caliper from the brake lines. You only need it out of the way, not removed entirely.

, The parking break will also be in contact with parts that must be removed. It does not have to be disassembled, but must be deactivated.








, When fully assembled, this is what the break pads normally make contact with. It will be bolted on, but just remove the bolts and pull it off. For some, a hammer may need to be used to break the rotor loose.








, Read the instructions that come with your tool before you use it.
Some axle bearings can be removed with just an impact wrench. Know which type you have before you begin this project so that you start with the appropriate tools.

Wait for a little while.,
Repeat the process as needed.",How to Remove a Dent in Car With a Hair Dryer," This is an especially useful method for removing small-to-medium-sized dents, and you may have more of these then you think. Examine your car carefully to find them all.;
, Dents can typically be removed using this method if they are located on the metal panels of the trunk, hood, doors, roof, or fenders, and are not right along the edges on broad flat surfaces.To achieve the best results, use this method on shallow dents that do not contain major creases or paint damage, and that cover a surface area with a diameter of at least 3 inches (7.62 cm).

, You will need a hair dryer, heavy-duty or thick rubber gloves for safe handling of the dry ice or compressed air in its liquid format, aluminum foil, and either a package of dry ice or a can of compressed air. You will need some of the following:


Heavy-duty insulated rubber-coated gloves.
A full (or nearly full) can of compressed air.
A package of dry ice.
A hair dryer with adjustable temperature settings, such as ""Low,"" ""Medium,"" and ""High,"" or ""Cool,"" ""Warm,"" and ""Hot.""
Aluminum foil.

, Turn on the hair dryer and use it to blow hot air over the dent and the surrounding area for one to two consecutive minutes.


The hair dryer should be set to medium and should be held between 5 and 7 inches (12.7 and 17.78 cm) away from the car's surface. Do not overheat the area in order to prevent the paint from becoming damaged due to overheating., Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the dented area. This step should only be performed if you are using dry ice instead of compressed air. The purpose of this step is to keep the area warm while also protecting the paint from the dry ice, which can potentially damage the topcoat.

, The gloves will protect you from frostbite and other injuries that can occur when your skin comes into contact with dry ice or liquified compressed air.

, The rapid change in temperature from warm to cold will cause the surface of your vehicle to first expand (when heated) and then contract (when cooled).If you are using dry ice, grab a block of the ice with one hand, then gently rub it over the aluminum foil resting on top of the dented area.
If you are using a can of compressed air, turn the can upside down, and spray the surface of the dented area to cover the area with a layer of liquid ice. There are some basic principles of science at work here: the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas are all interconnected. While normally the can loses temperature as the gas is released, if you spray the can upside down the gas itself is cooled.Either method will only require a brief application. The surface panels of most modern vehicles are made of relatively thin and lightweight material and they will cool very quickly. You will likely not see any change after the first 30-50 seconds of application, if not sooner still.

, A few moments after you have applied the dry ice or compressed air, you may hear a popping sound that will indicate the dent has been removed. The rapid temperature shift will usually make the material reform its original shape.


If you used dry ice, remove and dispose of the aluminum foil after the dent has been removed.
If you applied liquid ice by means of compressed air, wait for the white foam to dissipate from the surface of the car, then wipe residue away with a gentle cloth.

, For certain dents a single application may not be enough. If you see improvement but a dent is still noticeable, you can begin the process of heating and cooling again. However, do no overuse this process (especially in a single day). While the rapid temperature changes can reshape your car exterior, the extreme cold is potentially hazardous to the paint.

, Training continues for 1 to 4 years depending on the complexity of the facility.


Your facility training team will determine whether you meet the standards to continue working as an air traffic controller once you have completed training. Controllers who do not perform satisfactorily during training may be dismissed based on recommendations from training staff.

Look for an airline gate agent position.,
Make sure you have the basic requirements for the position.,
Make sure you can lift heavy objects.,
Learn customer service skills.,
Be prepared to work irregular hours.,
Apply for the job.,
Prepare for your interview.,
Complete a training program.",How to Become an Airline Gate Agent," Their primary responsibilities include working with customers, especially with tagging and handling carry-on baggage that must be checked, scanning tickets, and boarding and deplaning aircraft. But they also often double as check-in counter agents and can find themselves also working at the baggage claim office in smaller airports., Go online and look at different companies and types of airlines to find which would be the best fit for you. Here are some examples of things to look for in your initial search:


Look at international carriers if you have an interest in traveling out of the country.
Figure out if you want to work for a budget or luxury airline. The differences may include the destinations flown to and the comfort in the plane itself (seat size, leg room, tray table size).
Find the size of the airline that will be best for you. Some airlines have tens of thousands of employees (United, Lufthansa, Qatar) while others, such as local carriers, can be quite small. The larger airlines usually fly to more destinations and tend to have international routes, but smaller airlines can offer a more “family feel” and can give you the opportunity to check-in repeat customers and make friends.Research any specific airlines that you may have a set interest in.

, If you want to stay in your current location, you should check for positions at your local airport and at the airlines operating there. If you have a specific location in mind then search at the closest airports to it. Also, use a search engine that specializes in aviation jobs such as http://us.aviationjobsearch.com/.

, In general, gate agents must be at least 18 years old, have graduated high school (or completed an equivalent program) and have a valid driver's license.These basic requirements may differ from airline to airline so be sure to read all job positions carefully.

If you don’t have much customer service experience, read about ways to expand on these skills. Do the following to gain an even greater understanding of what your customer service role will be:


Go to your local airport and watch the exchanges between the customer and the ticket service agent. Jot down any notes you find helpful and observe what the agent does in a stressful situation.
If you are traveling by plane, observe the gate agent at the gate itself while waiting for the flight to board. Look closely at any interaction they have with passengers and if they are free, go ask them for any tips on the position.
Roleplay with your friends some customer-airline gate agent interactions.

, Many airlines run on an around the clock, 365 days-a-year work schedule. An airline gate agent may be required to work odd shifts including late nights, early mornings, weekends, and holidays., Some airlines allow you to apply for jobs directly on their websites. Other airlines may prefer that you mail an application and your resume, or drop them off at the local airport. Here are some tips for the application process:


Make sure your resume is catered as best it can be to the airline gate agent position.
If you are applying in person, be respectful and dress in a business casual manner.
Convey your experience and interests clearly in your cover letter.

, Before the interview learn all you can about the airline itself and the specific position. Be prepared to answer questions about dealing with angry customers over delays,overbookings or lost baggage. Also, have answers prepared for the following broad questions:


What makes you interested in this position?
What are your strengths?
What are your weaknesses?
Explain a time where you had to use customer service skills.

Gain The Right Qualifications.,
The Correct Language.,
Get some Flight Training.,
Work on your interview skills.,
Fill your CV with as much essential information as possible.,
Have some good alternative skills.,
Research.,
Remember to never turn your back.",How to Become an Airline Pilot (Europe)," This does NOT apply for people paying for their training, but for people who are looking for scholarships and sponsorships from airlines. The qualifications that will stand out on your CV in the airline industry are in subjects like Physics, Mathematics and English. Although mainly a qualification in Physics is required, other relevant qualifications push you through the tough competition in achieving these sponsorships. But as the airline world is slowly turning to technology these days, a qualification in IT or Electronics won't hurt.;
, The worldwide airline language is English. If you are not an English speaker, you will need to start learning if you want to become a pilot. So, if you cannot read this article, start learning now.

, If you are applying for a sponsorship and get through all the stages, the sponsor will sort everything out for you. Sponsorship schemes usually collaborate with flight training providers, so nothing to worry about there. And the training is usually completely free in this case. But if you are funding your own training, you will be looking to pay from around £50'000 to £100'000. The cost of flight training is very high, but if you have a strong ambition for piloting, you won't be questioning the price. But in most cases, the more you pay, the more well-reputed the training provider, which means an increase in your chances through the competition. Training in Europe will get you an EASA Licence. This is the licence you will need if you would like to fly for a European Airline. If you are looking to fly for an American Airline, then you should be looking for an FAA Licence.

, Whether with flight training providers or with airlines, interviews are very important. In order to get the best out of your interview, you need lots of practice. Filming yourself or practicing with a friend/relative are both great practicing techniques. Consider looking into speaking with an experienced interviewer. They will provide you with useful information on how to conquer your interviews. And always remember to look your best when attending interviews, as interviewers have likely never seen you before and you don't want to ruin your first impressions.

, Showing you have an interest in flying is a great sign. This could be from sailplane gliding to building model aircraft. Anything related to flying gives your CV a little shine to it.

, Airlines want pilots with the right skills. Good communication, team-work, and organisation are the main set of skills one should have. The skills you have are important, it is not just the licence and the CV you hold that get you through.

, Research is key when applying for a job. When it comes to the interview, the airline expects you to know quite a bit about them and their history. This also shows that you are well-organised and prepared for the interview.

, If you hold a firm career ambition in Airline Piloting, the worst thing you can do is give up. There is always a way around things, even if it is hard to do so. Life is full of difficult challenges, but one should never give up on them. Never say never.

Get a Private Pilot Licence.,
Get a Commercial Pilot Licence.,
Enhance your pilot career with a degree.,
Advance your level with an Airline Transport Pilot Licence.",How to Become a Successful Commercial Pilot in Canada," The first step for any pilot is to get their Private Pilot Licence. This is considered the first step because it is the basic pilot licence that everyone must get. This licence allows you to fly, but it doesn't allow you to be paid to fly. This licence can be finished in as quickly as 2-3 months, depending on your skill and dedication.;
, This is the next licence after the Private Pilot Licence. It allows you to start working as a professional pilot. This licence requires 200-250 hours of flying hours before you are eligible to write the exam. When you get this licence, you will begin working entry level pilot jobs.

, This is not a required step to become a professional pilot. However, it is very beneficial for your pilot career if you have a degree. The most important thing for pilots is their licensing and flying experience. However, a university degree will help you stand out from other applicants. As with all careers in the world, the more educated applicant is given preference. In fact, airlines are known to give preference to applicants with a university degree. Remember, that it does not matter what you study, or what kind of degree you have. You do not necessarily have to have an aviation or science degree. The important thing is that you have further education.

, This is the highest level of licensing for a pilot. It allows you work as Captain on regional and major airlines. All major pilot jobs require this licence. It will require you a minimum of 1500 hours flying experience to be eligible to write this 2 part written exam. These hours will be built up by working as a pilot after getting your Commercial Pilot Licence.

,


The FAA requires dispatchers to have prior experience around airplanes and with flight planning. Entry-level jobs that provide such experience include dispatch clerk and radio operator; other positions, which include additional education (usually a college degree), include meteorologist or station manager.

,


Technical knowledge, such as how to craft and send a Notice to Airmen about hazardous conditions, or how to calculate fuel and weight for takeoff and landing, is required prior to taking the aircraft dispatcher test. You should be able to easily learn the relevant material as a lower-level aviation industry employee.

,


The FAA mandates that dispatcher courses offer 200 hours of training, which usually runs over 6 weeks. In the program, you will learn the basics of the dispatcher job, including flight diagnostics, advanced calculations, and proper communication protocol.
Many community colleges offer dispatcher training courses. There are also several for-profit training programs around the country. Likewise, many airlines offer the training course to current employees trying to become aircraft dispatchers.

,


Contact the FAA for test dates in your area. You must be at least 23 years old at the time of the test and must take the test within 90 days of completing your training course.
The first part of the test consists of 80 written questions covering basic aircraft dispatcher knowledge and takes 3 hours. The second part of the test is a practical exam and requires you to demonstrate mastery of flight planning, emergency protocol, pre-flight and departure procedures, in-flight practices, landing regulations, and post-flight procedures.

,,,


To stay certified, the FAA requires aircraft dispatchers to fly in a cockpit at least 5 hours every year.

Seek a variety of job opportunities.,
Consider employment with the military.,
Gain enough hours to become a commercial air pilot.,
Achieve seniority for more opportunities.",How to Become a Pilot," To enter flight school in the U.S. (and likely elsewhere), you will need your high school diploma. Study hard in school, and consider taking physics or mathematics courses to prepare early. If you do not have your high school diploma, earn a General Education Development (GED) certificate.Some flight instructors offer flying courses to teenagers as young as 16. Call local flight instructors to ask what their policies are. You may be able to get a head start in your training.;
, If you're on the fence about serving, joining the military can be a great way for you to receive flying lessons and gain hours. In the United States, the Air Force, Navy, National Guard, and Coast Guard offer flight training. Once you return to civilian life, you will already have flying hours under your belt.


To join the U.S. military, you must be at least 18 years old. If you are 17, you may join with parental consent., Although not required for every pilot job, most flight schools or employers prefer that an applicant has completed four years of college education. Some colleges offer degrees in aeronautics or aviation. If yours does not, pursue a degree in engineering, mathematics, or physics.Take liberal arts or humanities courses while you're in college. Flight school admissions offices look for applicants with balanced education.

, If your college degree did not involve aviation, you will need to take flight classes from an instructor certified with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA recommends that pilots do not apply for licensure until they have gained enough experience to complete a cross-country flight solo.Be aware that licensure requires significant experience and that you will be more likely to pass with extensive training., There are two major types of flight school: Part 61 training and Part 141 training. Part 61 is the most common type: it is flexible, adjusted by instructors to fit personal needs, and allows you to go at your own pace. Part 141 training is structured and goes at a faster pace, and the lesson plans are more detailed., Passing a physical examination requires several parts. First, you will need to fill out an online application and answer information about your demographics and medical history. Then, you will need to visit a doctor who can validate your physical health in multiple aspects (including height/weight, vision, mental health, and other areas).You will have a choice between applying for a first class, second class, or third class medical examination. First class is required for future airline pilots. Second class is required for commercial pilots. Third class is the least restrictive and is required for student licensure.
If you don't pass your physical examination, all is not lost. You may be able to fix it with treatment. For example, deaf pilots can obtain aircraft certification with an exemption for flights requiring radio communication.People with other disabilities may be eligible for restricted licensure.

, After you have received your medical certificate, you can qualify for a student pilot license. This will allow you to fly in less restrictive situations with your instructor and work towards full licensure.


Student pilots must be able to read, write, and understand English to answer radio calls from fellow pilots. If English is your second language, learn the language thoroughly before you apply.

, To earn a license, a pilot-in-training needs to earn at least 250 hours of flight time.You can log these hours via flight school, military training, or practicing with an FAA-certified instructor.


After you gain your license, you will need additional flying hours before you are qualified for more pilot jobs (like working at a commercial airline). Many pilots work as flight instructors to gain more flying hours after graduation.

, To become a licensed pilot, you will need to pass a written exam that includes safety information and a skills test. Your written exam will be observed by an FAA-certified instructor. Study beforehand and get plenty of sleep the night before so you're prepared when your test date comes.

, Depending on your goals as a pilot, you may want further certification to qualify you for certain jobs. The FAA offers certification in a variety of areas, such as flight instructor certification or multi-engine plane certifications. U.S. Military pilots are given an aviator badge that signifies special certification and ranking., A broad variety of jobs are available for flight school graduates, depending on how many flight hours you've completed. You can work for emergency services, air shows, firefighting or forestry organizations, or as a flight instructor while you're gaining your hours.


Different pilot jobs will require more or less hours and experience. If you know what kind of pilot job you want, know the requirements and qualifications needed to obtain that job.
Some pilots also take engineering jobs with airlines. If you're interested, study engineering as an undergraduate to gain relevant knowledge. You will also need to get a separate engineering license to work with commercial airlines.

, There are over 150 flying careers available in the U.S. Air Force, with each requiring different enlistment qualifications. Take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to know which careers you're qualified for.If you're in a hurry to find a job, ask to be put on the ""quick ship"" list. If any recruits drop out, you will be called in to take their place.

, For many pilots, their ultimate goal is to work at a commercial airline. You will need 1500 hours of flight time to be hired by a commercial airline, but most major airlines prefer at least 3000 hours.


Most airline companies will also require their applicants to pass a psychological and intelligence exam.
New airline pilots often start as first officers in regional airlines, where they can gain experience flying passengers in all weather conditions. Later, you can qualify for better, higher-paying positions.

, Advancement in most airline jobs is dependent on seniority. After 1-5 years, pilots can qualify for first officer positions. After 5-15 years, first officers can then advance to captain. Seniority will help you gain preferred flight assignments and take time off for weekends or holidays.


Beyond captainship, experienced pilots can also advance to chief pilot, director of aviation, and other positions depending on where they work.

Obtain all of the equipment needed (a rudder, dagger board, sail, mast, boom, and spirit pole etc).,
Assemble the sail.,
Launch the boat.,
Position yourself on the rail so that you are facing the bow (the smaller end) of the boat.,
Get hold of tiller extension with the hand closest to the stern (back) of the boat and hold it as if it is a microphone.,
Make sure the sail is always trimmed (adjusted) so that it will catch the wind.",How to Sail an Optimist," These should all come with the boat. If you are buying the boat new, a decent seller will always include rigging equipment such as lines (ropes) and blocks (pulleys). These are extremely expensive for what they are and also difficult to assemble if you buy them separately. It is also recommended to buy a dolly with the boat as well. Optimists are heavier than they look and if you are launching them from a beach, then dragging them on the sand removes the gel coat (the smooth finish on top of the fiberglass) and drastically slows you down in the water..;
, The sail ties should only be loose enough so that you can put a finger between them and the boom (also ensure that the sail can move over the boom without being caught on fittings). The mast ties should be tighter than this (so that the edge of the sail is up against the mast). Put the sail in the mast step (the metal fitting at the front of the boat) before putting up the spirit pole. The adjustments on the sail should be tightened/loosened so that no creases are visible. Generally, heavier wind requires tighter adjustments.

, Slip it into the water and point it towards the wind. While standing on the sea floor or on the dock, clip the rudder in. Line up the bottom pin to its hole first (as this one is longer), making sure the safety catch will prevent the rudder from coming out of the two fittings. Put the daggerboard into its trunk, but do not push it down completely yet. In one movement, push the boat away from the beach or dock and climb in. The wind may be coming from off-shore, cross-shore, or on-shore. In each case there will be directions and places the boat can sail. There are (Go zones) and other zones that the Optimist cannot or should not sail from called (No-Go zones).

, Your front foot should be up against the bulkhead (the foot high separator halfway up the boat).

, Hold the main sheet with your other hand. Make sure you do not wrap it around your hand because you may need to release it quickly to stop. Pull in the main sheet until the sail fills and stops luffing (flapping back and forth). Put down the dagger board completely when you are in deep enough water.

, Never sail directly into the wind. Pulling the tiller towards you will point the boat further away from the wind and pushing it away will point the boat more towards the wind if you are sitting on the opposite side to the sail. When going upwind, pull in the sail so that the end of the boom is at the back corner of the boat. When going downwind, let out the sail so that it is perpendicular to the rail. Always watch the sail and the wind direction so that you will be forewarned if the sail wants to come across the boat towards you. If the boom hits you, it will hurt!!

If you don’t know what to do when someone suddenly yells, “prepare to tack” or “watch the boom!” you may be in trouble.


Block: This is the nautical term for a pulley.
Boom: The horizontal support for the foot of the mainsail which extends aft of the mast. This is what you want to watch out for when changing directions in a sailboat. It can give you quite a wallop on the head if it hits you.
Bow: This is what the front of the boat is called.
Centerboard: This is a (usually fibreglass) plate that pivots from the bottom of the keel in some boats and is used to balance the boat when under sail.
Cleat: Cleats are what lines (or ropes) get fastened to when they need to be kept tight.
Halyard: Lines that raise or lower the sails. (Along with the sheets, aka running rigging.)
Hull: The hull is the body of the boat and consists of everything below the deck.
Jib: This is the sail at the bow of the boat. The jib helps propel the boat forward.
Genoa: A foresail which is larger in size than a jib.
Keel: The keel is what prevents a boat from sliding sideways (""making leeway"") in whatever way the wind is blowing and stabilizes the boat.
Line: Lines are ropes. They are everywhere on boats. There is only one ""rope"" on a sailboat, the bolt rope which runs along the foot of the mainsail.
Mainsail: As the name implies, this is the mainsail of the boat. It is the sail attached to the back of the mast.
Mast: The mast is a large, vertical pole that holds the sails up. Some boats have more than one mast.
Painter: This is a line positioned at the front of small boats. It is used to tie the boat to a dock or another boat.
Rudder: The rudder is how the boat is steered. It is movable so that when you turn the wheel or tiller, the rudder directs the boat in the direction you would like the boat to go.
Sheets: The lines that control the sails. (aka running rigging.)
Spinnaker: The usually brightly colored sail used when sailing downwind or across the wind.
Stays and Shrouds: There are wires that make sure the mast stays upright, even in very heavy winds. (aka standing rigging.)
Stern: This is the term for the back of the boat.
Tiller: The tiller is a stick attached to the rudder and is used to control the rudder.
Transom: This is what we would call the butt of the boat. It is the back part of the boat that is perpendicular to its centerline.
Wheel: The wheel works the rudder, steering the boat.
Winch: Winches help tighten the sheets and halyards. When these lines are wrapped around a winch (in a clockwise direction) , a sailor can turn the winch with a winch handle, providing mechanical advantage which makes it easier to bring in the lines.;
, In general, if you are a beginning sailor you will most likely not be operating your own schooner. You will probably be working with a catboat, cutter, or sloop.



Sloop: Sloops are the most common type of sailboat (when you think of a sailboat this is probably the one you picture in your mind.) It has a single mast and is rigged up with a jib in the front and a mainsail attached to back of the mast. They can range in size and are ideal for sailing upwind.

Catboat: A Catboat has a mast set up near the front of the boat and is a single-sail boat. They are small (or large, for that matter) and easily operated by one or two people.

Cutter: Cutters have one mast with two sails in the front and a mainsail on the back of the mast. These boats are meant for small crews or groups of people and can be handled relatively easily.

Ketch: A Ketch has two masts, with the second mast called the mizzen mast. The mizzen is shorter than the mainmast and is in front of the rudder.

Yawl: Yawls are similar to ketches with the difference being that their mizzen masts are located behind the rudder. The reason for this placement is that the mizzen on yawls is for keeping balance, rather than for moving the boat forward.

Schooner: Schooners are large sailboats with two or more masts. The mast in the back of the boat is either taller or equal in height to the mast at the front of the ship. Schooners have been used to commercially fish, transport goods and as warships.

, Aside from the terms used for the different parts of the boat, there are also certain terms that sailors commonly use while at sea (or heading out to sea.) A trick to remember that port is left and starboard is right is that starboard has two ‘Rs’ in it, which is the beginning letter of ‘right’. Starboard, green and right have more letters than port, red and left. You can also keep in mind that ""port wine is red"". Port: When you are facing the bow (the front of the boat) the side to your left is the port side.
Starboard: Starboard is the right side of the boat when facing the bow.
Windward: As the name might imply, windward is the direction from which the wind is blowing, upwind.
Leeward: This is also called ‘Lee’. This is the direction to which the wind is blowing, downwind.
Tacking: Tacking is when you turn the bow of the boat through the wind so that the wind switches from one side of the boat to the other. This is when you most need to be mindful of the boom, as the boom will swing from one side of the boat to the other when you tack (you don’t want to be in its way when it does that.)
Gybing (Jibing): This is the opposite of tacking, which means that it is when you turn the stern (or back) of the boat through the wind so that wind shifts to the other side of the boat. This is a more dangerous maneuver in a strong breeze than tacking since the boat's sails are always fully powered by the wind, and may react violently to the change in the orientation of the boat to the wind. Care must be exercised to control the boom during this maneuver as serious injury is a possibility if the boom travels across the cockpit uncontrolled.
Luffing: This is when the sails begin to flap and lose drive caused by steering the boat into wind or easing (loosening) sheets.

, It is important to look out for and honor navigational buoys--they'll let you know where the safe water exists. In North America, on your way out of the marina, red buoys are almost always left to port while green buoys are left to starboard. (Remember, Red-Right-Returning). For most of the rest of the world, this is the other way round.

, Inspect all the standing rigging—the cables and ropes that support the mast—including the turnbuckles and cotter pins securing the rigging to the hull. Many sailboats have dismasted because a 15-cent cotter pin was missing!


Check the lines (running rigging) that raise and control the sails (halyards and sheets respectively). Make sure that they are separated, not wrapped around each other or fouled on anything else, and that they all have a figure-eight knot or other stopper knot on the free (bitter) end so they cannot pull through the mast or sheaves.
Pull all lines out of their cleats and off their winches. There should be nothing binding any line; all should be free to move and be clear at this point.
If you have a topping lift—a small line that holds the back of the boom up and out of the way when the sail isn't in use—let it out until the boom sags downward freely, then re-tie or re-cleat it. Watch out for the boom; it's just swinging around at this point; it will cause a painful ""clunk"" if it happens to hit you or your crew. The boom will return to its normal, horizontal position when you hoist the mainsail completely.
If so equipped, be sure that the tiller is properly attached to and controls the rudder. Your sailboat is now prepared for you to hoist the sails!

, If your boat doesn't have some kind of wind direction indicator (windex) at the top of the mast, tie a couple nine-inch pieces of old cassette tape, VHS tape, or oiled yarn to the shrouds—the rigging cables that hold up the mast. These will show you from which direction the wind is blowing. Some sailors find cassette tape to be just too sensitive for this purpose. If that's the case with you, try using VHS tape or oiled yarn instead.


Place them on each side, about four feet up from the sides of the boat.
To sail effectively, you will need to know the apparent direction of the wind .

, The idea is to have the minimum amount of wind resistance when raising the sail, with the sail straight back. In this position, the sail won't be snagging on any shrouds or any other hardware, either. This isn't always easy. The boat won't turn readily because it's not moving (under way). Do the best you can, but be prepared to work for it!

If your boat has a motor, use the motor to keep the boat pointed into the wind while you hoist sail.
Here's a handy tip: if the water is not deep at your dock, or if you have no side pier, walk the boat out away from the dock and anchor it into the sand, and the boat will automatically point itself into the direction of the wind!

, Secure the bottom front (tack) of the mainsail and jib to their respective shackles on the boom and the bow of the boat.


There will be a small line (outhaul) attaching the rear corner of the mainsail (clew) to the end of the boom. Pull it so the foot of the main is taught, and cleat. This helps the mainsail have a smooth shape for the air flowing over it.
Hoist the mainsail by pulling down on its halyard all the way until it stops. It will be flapping around (luffing) like crazy, but that's OK for a short period of time. (Excessive luffing will drastically reduce the life and durability of the sail).
The leading edge of the sail (luff) must be tight enough to remove folds, but not so tight as to create vertical creases in the sail.
There will be a cleat in the vicinity of the halyard where it comes down from the top of the mast. Cleat the halyard. Using the jib halyard, raise the front sail (jib, genoa or simply the headsail), and cleat the halyard off. Both sails will be luffing freely now. Sails are always raised mainsail first, then the jib, because it's easier to point the boat into the wind using the main.

, Sailboats cannot sail directly into the wind. As shown below, the red zone in the diagram indicates a ""no go"" zone when under sail. To sail to windward, a sailing vessel must sail about 45-50 degrees off the wind and change direction by tacking (or zig-zag).






Turn the boat to the left (port) or right (starboard) so it's about 90 degrees off the wind. This is known as a beam reach.
Pull on the main sheet (trimming) until the sail is around 45 degrees away from straight back (aft). This is a safe place for the main while you trim the jib.
You will start moving and tilting (heeling) away from the wind. A heel of more than 20 degrees usually indicates that you're being overpowered. Releasing the mainsheet momentarily (breaking the main) will lessen the amount of heel, and you will return to a more comfortable sailing angle of 10 to 15 degrees.

, Although the mainsail is hoisted first, it is the jib that is trimmed first. There are two jib sheets, one for each side of the boat. Pull on the jib sheet on the the side away from the wind (leeward side). This is the active sheet while the other is called the lazy sheet.


The jib will form a curve or pocket; trim the sail until the front edge just stops luffing. Keep your hand on the tiller (or helm) and stay on course!

, Let out the main sheet until the front edge just starts to luff, then pull it back just until it stops.


If you or the wind hasn't changed direction, this is the most efficient place to set the sails. If anything changes, you have to adjust them in response.
You have just entered the world of the sailor, and you will have to learn to do many things at once, or suffer the consequences.

, If it starts to luff, you have two choices: tighten the sail sheet until it stops luffing, or steer away from the wind (bear off). When the sail luffs, it means that you are heading too much into the wind for your current sail setting. If you bear off slightly, (away from the wind) your sails will stop luffing.

, If you see it change so that the wind is coming from a direction that is more behind you, you will be wasting energy. Let out the sail until it is perpendicular to the wind. You will be constantly; watching the sails, the telltales, and trimming sails because the wind won't blow from a constant direction for long.


When the wind is at your back and side (aft quarter), it's called a broad reach. This is the most efficient point of sail as both sails are full of wind and pushing the boat at full force.
When the wind is at your back, you are running with the wind. This is not as efficient as reaching, because air moving over the sail generates lift and more force than just the wind pushing the boat.
When running with the wind, you can pull the jib over to the other side of the boat where it will fill. This is called wing-on-wing, and you have to maintain a steady hand on the tiller to keep this sail configuration. Some boats have a ""whisker pole"" which attaches to the front of the mast and the clew of the jib which makes the jib much easier to control and keep full of wind. Be sure to be vigilant of obstacles and other vessels, as having both sails in front of you blocks a significant portion of your view.

Be careful—when the boat is running, the sails will be way off to the side, and because the wind is basically behind you the boom can change sides suddenly (jibe or gybe), coming across the cockpit with quite a bit of force.
If you have a wind direction indicator at the top of your mast, do not sail downwind (run) so that the wind indicator points toward the mainsail. If it does, you are sailing with the boom on the windward side (sailing by the lee) and are at high risk of an accidental jibe. When this happens the boom can hit you with enough force to knock you unconscious and out of the boat (overboard).
It's a good practice to rig a preventer (a line from the boom to the toe rail or any available cleat) to limit the travel of the boom across the cockpit in case of an accidental gybe.

, Turn the boat slightly into the wind (""head up"") so your heading is about 60-75 degrees off the wind. You will have to trim in the sheets tighter so the sails are more closely in line with the boat. This is called a close reach. Your sails are acting like the airfoil of an airplane: the wind is pulling the boat instead of pushing it.

, Continue to turn into the wind (head up) and tighten the sheets until you can go no farther (the jib should never touch the spreaders on the mast). This is called close-hauled, and is as close as you can sail into the wind (about 45-60 degrees off the wind). On a gusty day, you will have all kinds of fun with this point of sail!

, Sail a heading that is close to upwind in the direction of your destination with good speed, a close reach. Close-hauled will be the main and foresail pulled tight along the boat centerline and will allow the boat to sail closest to directly upwind, but speed will be smaller. On most sailboats this will be about 45 degrees from the wind direction.


When you've gone as far as you can on this tack, turn the boat through the wind (or changing direction by tacking), releasing the jib sheet out of its cleat or off the winch drum as the front of the boat (bow) turns through the wind.
The main and boom will come across the boat. The mainsail will self-set on the other side, but you will have to quickly pull in the jib sheet on the now downwind side to its cleat or winch, while steering the boat so the mainsail fills and begins to draw again.
If you do this correctly, the boat won't slow down much and you will be sailing to windward in the other direction. If you're too slow tightening the jibsheet again and the boat bears off the wind too much, don't panic. The boat will be pushed sideways a little until it gains speed.
Another scenario would be to fail to put the bow of your boat through the wind quickly enough and the boat comes to a complete stop. This is known as being in irons, which is embarrassing, but every sailor has experienced it, whether or not they'll admit it is another story. Being in irons is easily remedied: when the boat is blown backwards you will be able to steer, and as the bow is pushed off the wind you will achieve an appropriate angle to the wind to sail.
Point the tiller in the direction you wish to go and tighten the jib sheet to windward, (backwinding the sail). The wind will push the bow through the wind. Once you've completed your tack, release the sheet from the winch on the windward side and pull in the sheet to leeward and you'll be on your way again.
Because speed is so easily lost when tacking, you'll want to perform this maneuver as smoothly and quickly as possible. Keep tacking back and forth until you get to your destination.

, Understand that it's best to practice on calm days, and so, for example, learn to reef your boat (make the sails smaller). You will need to do this when the wind is too strong and you're being overpowered.


Reefing almost always needs to be done before you think you need to!
It's also a good idea to practice capsize procedures on a calm day too. Knowing how to right your boat is a necessary skill.

, Remember that your anchor and its chain/line (rode) are important pieces of safety gear and can be used to stop your boat from going aground or can even be used to get the vessel floating again should a grounding occur.

, Once you are safely at port, lower your sails by removing the tension from any of the lines, ""halyards"", holding the sails up. Once you have lowered your mainsail, it may be neatly ""flaked"" and secured to the boom with several ties, then covered. When your sails are not in use for a significant amount of time, they should be loosely folded and placed in their sail bags. You may need to do this for both your mainsail and the jib. Remove all sail battens from their pockets before folding the main. Do not fold your sails the same way every time or they will develop deep creases that will not be shaken out by the wind. Your sails should be stored when they are dry and mostly salt-free, as wet sails that are stored are generally inclined to grow mildew.

, Secure lines by tying them to cleats. Neatly wrap all loose lines up and secure them with ties, out of the way of anyone walking around on the deck. Wash the deck of salt, particularly if you have a teak deck. Salt can leave stains on the wood.

Connect a deflated boat to a pump.,
Attach the oars by threading them through the pockets at the top of the boat.,
Place the craft on the water.,
Load the boat with supplies before you get on.,
Get onto the boat.,
Get comfortable on the seat.,
Grasp the handles of the oars.,
Glide both oars above the surface of the water, and then dig them into the water when your arms are fully extended.,
Engage your abdominal muscles.,
Focus on the pace of the rowing.,
Turn the boat by lifting one oar out of the water and continuing the motion with a single oar.",How to Row an Inflatable Boat," An electric pump is best for larger craft. Pump the inflatable boat according to the manual’s instructions.;
, There may be one or two sets of oars, depending upon the size of the boat. Larger boats are likely to also be equipped with an outboard motor.


An oar is connected to a boat, while a paddle is separated and controlled entirely by the paddler.
Face the oars in or atop the sides of the boat until you are loaded.

, Tie it from the anchor point to a dock if you are near the water. It is best to keep a rope tied to the boat for easy anchoring when you go ashore.

, Make sure to include a patch kit, a small pump, and a container for bailing along with your first aid kit. If you are leaving from shore, you may want to load supplies and then push the boat into the water.

, Sit on the seat assigned to the person paddling with your back to the water. If there are multiple people, the person who will be doing the rowing should get on first, so that you will have control of the boat from the beginning.

, Some boats have a raised seat for the person paddling, while others place it flush with the bottom. You may have to cross your legs and lean back against the back of the boat to find a sustainable rowing position., If they are adjustable, you should adjust them when you find a calm spot on the water or before you take off. The top of your hands should go on the top of the oar, with the blade perpendicular to the water’s surface.


Your thumb can go on the end of the handle or wrap around the bottom.

, You will lean forward and your arms will go forward to move the oars backward and vice versa.

, Lean back and pull the oars back while they are completely submerged, until your arms are even with your chest. Focus on sitting as straight as possible while you row.

, The pushing motion should be as quick as possible, so that the oars aren’t out of the water for long. Then, the pulling motion should be as deep as is comfortable with your posture.


Flipping the oars out of the water as quickly as possible will minimize wind resistance.

, Rowing with just the left oar will turn you counterclockwise. Rowing with only the right oar will turn you clockwise.

Reef while you are still docked for best control.,
Stay attuned to signs that reefing may be needed while underway.",How to Reef a Sail1,"


If there’s any hint of stormy weather, shorten the mainsail before you set out. It’s easier to unreef, or let the mainsail out, if the weather threat recedes than it is to reef while sailing in the midst of high winds.





;
,


Watch wind speeds. Reef when gusts become frequent or wind speeds increase by more than 5 knots.






Be sensitive to shifts in barometric pressure, changing cloud patterns and other weather signals.






Reef deeply. Shorten the sail as much as possible the first time. Again, it’s easier to let it out than it is to reef twice.







"
"
Look for reefing points on the mainsail.,
Check to see if the boat is rigged for jiffy reefing.,
Identify roller reefing systems.,
Find automated reefing systems.",How to Reef a Sail2,"


Reefing points are 1, 2 or 3 horizontal rows of cringles (reinforced grommets) and reefing lines (attached ties) on the mainsail. From the foot of the sail up, each row of reefing points shortens the sail a little more.







,


This system runs a special set of lines through the reefing points, so you can reef the sail by tightening just one line.







,


Boats with roller reefing have gears that allow you to shorten the mainsail by turning a crank that furls the sail around the boom or the mast.

,


Larger boats, and those used in racing, may be equipped with automated reefing systems. These are essentially push-button versions of roller reefing systems. In the most sophisticated systems, the boom or mast may have a specially constructed hollow into which the mainsail is furled.







"
"
Head into the wind to keep the boom as motionless as possible.

,
Loosen the boom vang, the mainsail sheets and the halyard.

,
Lower the sail just enough to align the desired row of reefing points with the boom.

,
Tighten the jiffy line if the boat is rigged this way.,
Secure the reefing cringles by hand if the boat is not equipped with jiffy reefing lines.,
Follow manufacturer’s instructions for using a manual or automated roller reefing system, if one is installed.

",How to Reef a Sail3,",,,


This creates a new tack and clew, shortening the sail.







,


Begin with the luff (leading edge) cringle. Secure it to the boom by catching the grommet on a hook on the boom, if there is one, or by inserting a reefing hook into the grommet and tying it to the boom near the gooseneck. You can also tie the cringle to a cleat on the mast. This creates a new tack. Tighten the halyard to secure it.






Secure the leech (trailing edge) cringle to the aft part of the boom, creating a new clew. Do this by threading a line up from the boom, through the leech cringle, and back down to the boom. This line may be led either down or forward to a winch that can be used to tighten the connection.






Gather up the loose canvas. If there’s time, flake the foot of the sail so it’s easier to manage. Secure this excess canvas by tying it loosely above the boom with the attached reefing lines, or with bungee cords threaded through the cringles. Don’t tie these lines too tightly, or the sail will crease vertically, and don’t tie them under the boom. Use square or slip knots so these ties can be loosened quickly if necessary.






Check that the shortened sail is as flat as possible. Keep the lines securing the luff and leech cringles (tack and clew) tight, and the reefing holding the spare sail loose.

Know the parts of your boat.,
Know how to steer your boat.,
Know how to use your motor's gearshift and throttle.,
Carry all appropriate safety equipment, in good working condition.,
Cell phone.,
Know where you are on the water and where you're going.,
Maintain a safe speed at all times.,
Watch the weather.,
Follow all rules and regulations for operating your boat.",How to Operate a Freshwater Fishing Boat1," Although knowing the terminology is only a small part of boating, knowing and understanding the terms for the parts of your boat shows you as a thoughtful boater, concerned with the operation of his or her watercraft.


The hull is the outer skin of your boat. Most fishing boats have 1 of 3 types of hulls: a V-hull, where the boat tapers to a single point at the front; a tri-hull, where the front comes to 3 points with curves between the points; and a flat-bottomed hull, where the front and back are both squared off. Jon boats are the most common flat-bottomed hull boat, while bass boats are often tri-hull boats but may also be flat-bottom or V-hull boats.






The bow is the front of your boat. At lower speeds, it is the part of the boat that cuts through the water, while at higher speeds, it lifts out of the water, causing the boat to go ""on plane.""






The stern is the rear of your boat. On boats other than kayaks or canoes, it is squared off perpendicular to the boat's sides. It is where the boat's main motor is mounted. The material forming the stern is called the ""transom;"" this word is sometimes used interchangeably with ""stern.""






The gunwales (pronounced and sometimes spelled ""gunnels"") are the upper parts of your boat's sides.






The port side of your boat is the left side, and the starboard side is the right side.





;
, How you steer your boat depends on how you power it and how powerful the propulsion unit is.


If fishing from a rowboat, you propel yourself forward by stroking both oars equally and turn by stroking the oar on the side opposite the direction you want to turn harder: to turn the bow left, stroke the starboard oar harder; to turn the bow right, stroke the port oar harder.
Steering a boat powered by an outboard motor depends on how powerful the motor is. Motors of 20 horsepower or less are usually steered with a tiller (collapsible handle), attached to the motor; to steer the boat, point the tiller in the opposite direction from that which you want to point the bow. To steer to port, point the tiller to the right, which turns the propeller to port; to steer to starboard, point the tiller to the left, which turns the propeller to starboard. Larger motors are usually steered from a cockpit with a steering wheel similar to that on a car; turn the wheel in the direction in which you want to point the bow. (Fishing boats with inboard-outboard motors are also steered with a steering wheel unit.)
Some outboard-motor equipped boats are steered with a control stick placed near the front or middle seat, allowing the operator greater forward visibility. Moving the stick forward steers the boat in one direction and pulling it back steers it in the other. Stick steering is typically found in boats powered by outboard motors of 50 horsepower or less; some manufacturers rate their controls for use up to 70 horsepower.
Fishing boats equipped with stern-mounted electric trolling motors are usually steered by tiller, although some units feature dual-propeller units that mount on the propulsion unit of a larger outboard or inboard-outboard motor. Some boats, notably bass boats, are equipped with bow-mounted trolling motors steered with a foot control pedal. Some control pedals steer by pushing either the top or the bottom of the pedal to steer the boat in a given direction, while others steer by pushing the left side of the pedal to turn the bow to port and the right side to turn to starboard.

, The presence and position of the gearshift and throttle depend on the size of the motor.


The smallest motors have no gearshift; most, however, have a gearshift with forward, neutral, and reverse positions, often oriented so that you pull the gearshift lever forward to go forward and push it back to go in reverse. The throttle control is a sliding lever mounted on the front of the motor; sliding the lever to the right makes the motor go faster.
Larger outboard motors, and inboard-outboard motors, use lever controls mounted on the gunwale adjacent to the cockpit to control whether the motor runs in forward, neutral, or reverse and how fast it runs.
Electric trolling motors may either have set speeds or variable speed controls. All but the smallest tiller-controlled units have forward and reverse, while bow-mounted motors often rely on turning the motor opposite the boat to move it in reverse.
Be aware that putting a motor in neutral or stopping an electric motor will not stop the boat. It will instead continue drifting forward at gradually decreasing speed. You can shorten the drift by briefly running the motor in reverse.

, Important equipment to have aboard includes the following:


Life jackets/personal flotation devices. Most jurisdictions require a life jacket or PFD be available for each person aboard the boat, and children below a certain threshold age should be wearing theirs. It's a good idea to wear yours at all time regardless of your age.
Kill switch. This device connects to your motor and your belt; if you're thrown from the boat, it kills the engine so the boat won't continue on the water under power. This can save the lives of other boaters, and yours as well, as boats have been known to turn on their owners.
Fire extinguisher. Keep this near enough to the motor to put it out if it catches fire.
Rope. In addition to anchor line (described under ""Anchoring Your Boat""), you should have rope for tying your boat to the dock and to serve as tow rope, either if you get stranded or to assist a fellow boater.
Signaling devices. These include an air horn or whistle, distress flag, and flares.
Weather radio. Having a radio on board to alert you to weather changes can be helpful, particularly if you're more focused on catching fish than watching the skies.

, Although thought of more for less important communication, you can use a cell phone to call for help in an emergency.

, Learn to find landmarks on shore to identify your position on the water and observe the positions of other boats on the water relative to you to avoid colliding with one of them or running aground.

, Although some boats are capable of riding ""on plane,"" do so only on open, calm water when no other boats are in the vicinity of the wake you'll create by going that fast. In rough water conditions, go only as fast as necessary to get off the water without getting into a more dangerous predicament.


Never go so fast as to cause your hull to porpoise and slap the water. This is called cavitation, and it is often a prelude to losing control of your boat, particularly during a turn.

, Storms can come up suddenly on the water, so pay attention to sudden changes in temperature, cloudiness, or wind direction.


It's a good idea to have foul weather gear aboard in case you can't get off the water before a storm hits, such as a waterproof rain parka with elastic cuffs.

, The jurisdiction (state, province, or territory) in which you live and operate your fishing boat has established rules and regulations for the operation of boats on its waters. Knowing and following these regulations is sound practice for running your fishing boat.


Most jurisdictions require fishing boats over a certain length to be registered and display a license number and stickers identifying the jurisdiction in which the boat is registered. Jurisdictions that require boats to be steam-cleaned before operating on waters used as sources of drinking water also require those boats to bear a sticker identifying the boat as having been steam-cleaned.
Some jurisdictions prohibit the use of outboard motors in certain waters or restrict boats to ""no wake"" operation at slow speeds to prevent shoreline erosion.
Major rivers and large lakes may employ navigational buoys or beacons to identify which waters are deep enough for safe boat operation. Keep your boat correctly positioned with respect to these markers.

Get all your parts together.,
Put together both the pieces of your mast.,
Slide the sail over the mast.,
Insert the battens into the sail, they should slide in and then you push your end of the batten down so it won't fall out.

,
Stand up the mast.,
Get your boom, and put its front end into the gooseneck (the little pin sticking out of your mast).,
While still holding the boom on the gooseneck, walk around to the flapping end of the sail.,
Attach the clew-tie-down (a small line that wraps around the ring the outhaul is attached to) and wrap it around the boom and tie it so that the clew is as close to the boom as it can be while still being able to slide back and forth along the boom.

,
Attach the boom vang (This piece holds the boom down while you're sailing).,
Rig the mainsheet.,
Just before you put the laser in the water, check to be sure the hull plug is screwed into the drain hole in the stern.,
Launch.",How to Rig a Laser Sailboat," You should have the boat itself (the hull), the dagger board, the rudder and tiller, your mainsheet, both mast pieces, boom, boom bang and sail in one place.;
, The bottom of the top half just slides into the top of the bottom half. There are no locks, or anything, it should just fit snugly.

, There will be a pocket along one side of the sail to slide over the mast.

,, This is the hardest part of the entire rigging process, so be careful, no-one likes a broken mast or hull. You stand up the mast, make sure it's right next to the bow of the laser, and pick it straight up off the ground, and put it into the mast step (the hole at the front of your laser). A way to make this easier is to grab the mast around the middle, then walk forward thereby pushing the sail up. While walking you should also move your top hand up to have better control of the mast.


The sail should now be flapping in the wind.

, Hold it in there, as it will fall off without any other support.

, Grab the outhaul (the line on the very end of the sail), and put it through the eye at the end of the boom. Now run the line down the boom, and cleat it off.


If you have cleated the outhaul properly, the boom should now stay up on its own.

,, Supposing it is already rigged itself, you only have to attach it to the bottom of the mast, then slide it into the little metal clip on the bottom of the boom. Now pull down on the hanging line, and then pull straight up to cleat it.

, Take one end of it, go to the end of the boom, and tie it around the eye on the bottom of the pulley there. Do not put it through the pulley itself; you're going to need that pulley in a moment. Now that it's tied off, find the other end of your line, and run it through the traveler on the stern of the boat. Then run it back up, through the pulley on the end up the boom, then forward across the bottom of the boom, through that metal loop, through the next pulley, and then down through the main block at the front of the cockpit. Make sure that your main block clicks when you pull the mainsheet through it - if it doesn't, you have to run the mainsheet through the other side of the main block. Then tie a knot in the very end of the mainsheet, so the line can't run back through the main block when you are sailing or if you capsize.

, Then attach the rudder, tiller and daggerboard. Slide the rudder pins into the eyes on the backside of the laser, and make sure that the clip is holding it down.


Test it by pulling up on the rudder. Then put on the tiller by sliding it into the space on the top of the rudder. Once it's in, insert the pin to hold it there.
Tie the dagger board with a long loop of elastic to the eye at the very front of the boat.
Verify the elastic creates enough friction that the daggerboard will stay up or down (even when you invert the boat).

, The last thing you need to do, just before you start sailing, is tie down the rudder. There is a tiny string, found anywhere around the rudder and tiller, that you have to pull on to bring down the rudder. Once it's down, tie off the string on the cleat that is on the side of your tiller, and you're set to sail!

"
"
Choose the right kind of anchor.,
Attach a length of galvanized chain to the anchor.,
Connect the chain to a sufficient amount of nylon anchor line.,
Look for as sheltered a place to anchor as you can find.,
Determine the depth to and type of bottom.,
Point the bow of your boat into the wind or current.

,
Shift your motor into neutral when you reach the place you want to drop anchor.

,
Drop anchor slowly once the boat stops moving forward.

,
Set the engine to idle reverse and back down on the anchor to ensure it is set.",How to Operate a Freshwater Fishing Boat2," Anchors are available in several types. Those commonly used for fishing boats include the following:


Plow-style: This anchor is so named because it resembles a farming plow and gets its holding power from plowing into sediment on the lake or river bottom.
Danforth: This anchor has 2 thick, pointed flukes that dig into the bottom to give it its holding power. (Because of its design, the Danforth is also known as a fluke anchor.)
Mushroom: This anchor features a round, heavy bottom with a continuous lip and is so named because it resembles a large mushroom. Its holding power comes primarily from how its weight is distributed. It is best suited for smaller boats and not suited for anchoring in choppy water.

, Use a length of 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 m). The chain will stand up to wear and tear caused by rock, sand, mud, or brush better than a fiber line.

, This line will stretch and contract as waves lift and lower the boat while it's anchored, absorbing the shock. You'll need to purchase enough line so that you can pay out 5 to 7 times the depth of the water you're fishing in plus the distance from the anchor cleat to the water's surface. If you're fishing in 18 feet (5.4 m) of water and the anchor cleat is 2 feet (0.6 m) above the surface, you'll need to pay out from 100 to 140 feet (30 to 42 m) of anchor line to cover the 20 feet (6 m) from the cleat to the lake or river bottom.


The best way to store the anchor line until needed is on a windlass near where you normally sit when fishing or operating the boat with guides to keep the line between the bow cleat and windlass next to the gunwale. Some windlasses feature a hand crank with a quick release feature for lowering the anchor.

, The ideal place should be away from other boats, out of the wind, and away from current.

, A depth sounder can help you find how deep the water is and also help determine whether the bottom is sandy, muddy, or rocky, coupled with your observation of the nearest shoreline.

,,,,


Once you have set the anchor, find landmarks to establish your position and check these periodically to make sure your boat isn't drifting.
Some anglers use both a bow and a stern anchor. If you choose to do this, always set the bow anchor first, and never use the stern anchor alone; if you do, you risk swamping and capsizing your boat.

"
"
Position yourself so you are straddling the seat nearest the motor.,
Prime the motor by squeezing the primer bulb on the fuel line until resistance is felt.,
Make sure the boat is in neutral.,
Advance the throttle to the ""start"" position.,
If the engine is cold (hasn't been started recently) pull out the choke knob.

,
It may help to stand up straddling the seat during this part.,
If the engine does not start in 3-4 pulls, push the choke in and try again 3-4 times.,
When the engine fires, adjust the choke inwards to provide a smooth idle, and adjust the throttle to a slow speed.

,
Put the motor into either forward or reverse, depending where you are.

,
To steer the boat, pull the handle with your hand to turn.",How to Drive a Boat With an Outboard Motor,";
, Never squeeze the bulb while the motor is running.

, Generally, this will be with the shift lever in the up position, or the middle position between reverse and forward.

, This may be indicated, or can be approximated by putting the throttle at 1/3 power.

,, Pull the handle out until it stops, then give it a quick, long yank on the rope. It probably won't start the first time, so try many times.

, Alternate with the choke in and out.

,,, Twisting it toward you will make the boat go faster, and twisting it away from you will make it go slower. Pushing the motor away will turn it right, and vice versa.

Find a park or lake that rents out paddle boats.,
Find friends or loved ones to go with!,
Before going paddle boating, gather the supplies you'll need.,
When you get there, have one person pay for renting or place your boat near the water.,
Choose the two people that are going to be paddling first.,
Have the people in the front back up and head for the middle of the lake.,
Switch every every ten minutes or so, and stay fair.,
Chat!,
If possible, bring a waterproof camera with you.,
Have fun paddle boating!

",How to Have Fun Paddle Boating," If you own a paddle boat, skip this step. Before renting one check the place you're renting out from in advance. Check for ducks (they can carry swimmer's itch), dead fish, etc. Check the paddle boats to make sure they're not falling apart and are in good condition.;
, It's never fun to paddle boat alone. Talk to them about their schedules, and when they're open. Consider splitting the price. Tell them what they need to bring - bathing suit, towels, sunscreen, etc.

, Water bottles, towels, etc. Make sure to bring more than you need in case someone's forgotten to bring it. Go and pick up your friends and or loved ones and drive to your destination!

, It's generally considered polite for you to do this. Now get dressed and put on some sun screen.

, Decide how you're going to rotate through the seats. Let the people sitting in the back go first, then the paddlers.

, If you're the people in the back, look for fish, go leach searching, let your feet drag in the water, just have fun! Soon you'll be paddling, so enjoy the time that you have to kick back and relax!

, An argument would ruin your boating trip. If you're the person in the front, ask everybody where they want to go. If there are children on the boat, pretend you're a pirate captain, and say things like ""Land ho!"" or other pirate sayings.

, Even if your paddling. if you don't know what to say, say something like, ""Isn't it hot out?"" or ""How was it at work today?"" However, make sure to let everybody talk, so no one feels left out.

, You can make a scrapbook! If you don't have a waterproof camera with you, don't bring it. If you drop it, and it's not waterproof, it will break and possibly sink.

Practice using a backstroke.,
Try turning the boat.,
Work on the scissor stroke, also called a river turn.,
Stop the drift boat.,
Exit the boat.",How to Row a Drift Boat1,"


Until you are comfortable with your skills, practice your backstroke in a calm area of the river where there are few obstacles and you can easily control the boat.
Sit in the row seat facing the bow of the boat (the bow is the high end of the boat).
Place each oar in its oarlock.
Face the drift boat downstream so that the bow (and you) are facing downstream.
Grab hold of both the oars (the end of each oar in each hand).
Push down on the oars until they are level with the boat. They will be out of the water.
Push forward so the oars reach out behind you.
Place the oars down in the water.
Pull the oars back so they run through the water and in front of you.
Return to the beginning seated position.;
,


Use only one oar and complete the backstroke movement. If you use the right oar, it moves the boat backward and to the left. If you use the left oar, it moves the boat backward and to the right. Try the same movement while holding the other oar steady in the water. This will help to pivot the boat.


,


Push forward with one oar while you pull back with the other. You’re basically completing a forward stroke with one hand and a backstroke with the other. This causes the boat to spin.

,


Hold an oar in each hand with the oars level and pushed out of the water. Push the oars straight down into the water and hold them in place as much as possible.

,


Pull the oars into the boat (all the way up to the blade) and place them in front of you (called shipping). Then exit by the transom (stern) so the boat doesn't act violently as you leave.

Choose a name carefully: If you have ever owned a boat or have planned to buy one, you'll ultimately have to name your boat and purchase boat lettering.,
If you find you need help from these name lists to find a boat every bit as good as ""Wet Dream or Liquid Asset"" or Wind Dancer"", then customize a popular name to make it your own.",How to Name and Letter Your Boat," It is seemingly an easy step but you'll soon find naming a boat is far from an easy task for most of us. There are a few basic things you should know ahead of time. Boat lettering comes in two basic types. Painted on boat lettering is generally done by a local lettering artist (preferably one with boat lettering experience). The quality of the lettering will depend on the experience of the craftsman and his brush. If you decide to have your boat lettering hand painted, a marina is a great place to start. Not only will you see many examples of how others have displayed their boat name, you might also ask the marine operator for a few references for your own painted on project.


More popular now is computer fabricated vinyl boat lettering which can be made at many local sign shops and hundreds of places on the web. There's no shortage of vendors that can make boat lettering for you. Picking one of them is the easy part. The real task at hand is deciding exactly what you will be naming your boat. Take your time and give your boat a really great name. Conventional wisdom might be to grab a list of the most popular boat names and simply pick one of them and head down to your boat lettering vendor. That would be great if you want to be just like the other 500 or so boats in your state sharing the same name! The 10 best boat names from whatever list you find should be your blacklist of boat names to avoid!
Think about the name. Picking your boat name should be something you take time with! Don't settle for the very first thing that pops in your mind. Here are the key components you should consider when picking a boat name:
Decide on the personality of your boat. Fishing Boats have a much different personality than Cigarette style boats. It wouldn't make much sense to name a racing body boat with a hook and sinker type of name like - well - ""Hook and Sinker"" for example!
Is there anything special about your boat such as an unusual story behind the purchase of it, or possibly something unusual about yourself? For example, I know a guy that has flipped his speedboat twice and the same number of times he had to recover the boat from the sea bottom. He named his boat ""Sunk Twice"". There is no doubt it is truly a unique name and it's even a story in itself, but is it a good boat name? I'm sure his drinking buddies adore the name. But if you plan to invite your neighbors 13 year old kid to go fishing with you and your 12 year old, lots of luck persuading other parents to let the kid come along! Trying to find the right boat name can be a chore, but don't be tempted to resort back to the best boat name listings found on the net. Everyone uses these names over and over. Some of the real popular names are used so much there are several of these already moored in the marina of your choosing, all claiming to be ""Miss Behavin' or Aquaholic or Obsession"", just to name a few.;
, For example ""Obsession"" is one of the very popular boat names. Why not customize it, such as ""Kristy's Obsession"" or even more daring but cool ""My Wet Obsession"" to add a bit of dark humor to the name.


Pick a name that means something to you or to someone you love. The number one mistake in picking a boat name is picking a name that might be impressive to others! Instead pick a name that is the most valuable to you. You are paying for the boat so why name it for the amusement of strangers. Name the boat for your own purpose and select a name that actually provides you the amusement or the enjoyment.
There are a number of places to research your boat name. There are books in the library that cover the subject very well. You can also take a popular name and tailor it to your own liking. Or better yet, consider using an interactive boat name tool such as StreetGlo's free 'Live' boat lettering name suggestions database. This boat name tool is unique because it's tied to a network of sources for new boat names, one of which comes from a pool new boat owners designing their own boat names. It also compiles new boat names by monitoring the ""boat name"" searches on Google and other search engines. It also captures names from boat lettering order entries thus insuring someone liked these new names enough to invest in boat lettering. Have a look yourself and see new boat lettering names along with a suggested font and color plan that supports the personality these new boat lettering names.
Another great tool to help you name your boat is the NOAA fisheries Vessel Documentation Search. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is a federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat (as per the official identity per the NOAA website). But for your purpose, you can find out just how often your choice in boat name is used by doing a simple boat name search in NOAA's Vessel Documentation. If you think you've come with an awesome new name, you can check it at NOAA's site. Likewise, you might be surprised to find out the name you picked has already been used 10,000 times and this doesn't even include the millions of small watercraft not linked to the NOAA's database.
Investing a little time in your boat name can provide greater enjoyment of your watercraft by helping establish and preserve the mood that motivated you to buy the boat in the first place. There are few things about your boat which will continue to provide satisfaction, comfort and rest to you over and over without ever costing you again and again. I can only think of two things that fit this category, the Porta-Potty and the boat name! No doubt they both will be the constant source of stress relief and substantial contributors to your overall sense of comfort and release!

Point the bow of the boat toward the obstacle (also called “setting up the boat”) and backstroke away from it.,
Be wary of the river’s outside bend where the water’s velocity increases and often collects downed trees and rocks.",How to Row a Drift Boat2," Leaning away will increase the chances of flipping the boat.


Pivot the boat by dragging one oar in the water while backstroking with the other oar until the drift boat is about 45-degrees across the river current.
Backstroke with both oars away from the obstacle.
Straighten out the drift boat and move the boat around the obstacle.

Set up the boat when you spot the outside bend. Aim the stern of the drift boat toward the bend’s inside corner.
Use the backstroke to push the boat away from the outside bank.

Lean into a rock in your drift boat to keep water from filling the boat.,
Re-slam your oar when it pops out of the oarlock.",How to Row a Drift Boat3," This is called broaching.


Push away from the rock with your hands, oars or feet.

,


Be familiar with how your oar fits into your oarlock. Practice fitting the oars into the oar locks from different positions so you can easily “re-slam” them in any situation. You should be able to re-slam your oars in 2 seconds.

Determine what type of boat that you want to learn more about in a private boating class.,
Assess your location in relation to where the private boating classes are offered.,
Consider the costs for the training offered in a private boating class.,
Make sure that the private boating class instructors themselves have proper training, education and experience in boating instruction.,
Conduct some research on the Internet to explore available opportunities for private boating classes in your region.,
Consider taking some online courses that focus on boat safety and navigation as well as boat laws and regulations before you actually venture out onto the water and take your private boating class.,
Realize that some private boat instructors may offer the option of coming to you to provide you with private boating classes.,
Choose private boating classes that will meet the needs for the particular type of boat that you will be learning to navigate.,
Contact and obtain more information about those private boating classes that you are most interested in.,
Complete any necessary registration forms required for admission to your private boating class.",How to Find a Private Boating Class," What are your interests and what type of access do you have to local lakes, rivers and the ocean that may border the area where you reside?;
, Some long distance travel may be necessary to get to your private boating class. Think of it as a short vacation to learn more about boat safety and navigation so that you can better enjoy the activity.

, Do some initial research to explore the various options that may be available in your area to get comprehensive instruction for a reasonable fee.

, If they are licensed and certified, that is an added plus. Look for professional level instructors having extensive expertise and knowledge.

, Many private boat instructors have websites providing extensive information on the types of private boat classes available. Also check out the yellow pages both online and in your local phone book for those private boat instructors that may not have a website.

, Preparation and prior knowledge will better equip you toward becoming a better boater.

, Such instruction would likely encompass a more expensive rate and additional fees.

, There are private boating classes that cover just the basics but do not expand on topics geared to specific types of boats. If you are new to sailing, for example, your private boating class should include instruction to prepare you navigate and handle one successfully.

, Have the instructors provide you with additional detailed information to help you decide if their course is the right one for you.

, Chart out your goals, attend your private boating classes and learn how to successfully and safely navigate the open waters.

Prefer boarding across a solid platform if possible.,
Hold on.,
Keep your balance.,
Once in the boat, always remain in the centre line to move around it and lower yourself to a crouch level so that you reduce your centre of gravity and keep the craft as still as possible.,
Keep the craft steady as others board.",How to Board a Small Boat," Always board as near to the middle of the boat as possible.;
, If you are crossing using a platform, hold on to the rails provided. If you are getting onto the boat off a jetty or via wading, hold on to the boat itself.

, Avoid plonking one leg in the boat and leaving one on the jetty - this will cause wobbling and you might fall into the water. Equally, do not jump into the boat as this will risk tipping the craft and pushing you out. Instead, use steady movements and be concise.

, Be seated as soon as practicable.

, If you can, steady the boat by holding onto the jetty or sitting in the middle and not moving. Give others a hand to steady them as they get in so that there is minimal rocking. If you are the lucky last who has to wade the boat out and hop in, hold the boat as you stand in the water while others get in. When you hop in, have them steady the boat and give you a hand up.

Choose a stereo.,
Decide which features you would like to customize your boat stereo system with.,
Determine the type of speakers you want for your marine audio system.,
Determine the placement for all of your stereo components.",How to Design a Marine Audio System," Marine stereos have electronic parts that are coated to protect them from water, salt and the sun's UV rays. Consider the following when choosing a stereo for your marine audio system:


Size. Most boats come with standard, in-dash stereo installation. The size of your dash cut-out will limit the type of stereo you can get.
Installation. You may opt to mount your stereo, as opposed to installing it in the dash. Mounted stereos come with enclosures to protect them from the elements, and can be mounted in a location of your choice.
Power output. If you want your boat sound system to produce high volume and rich sound, you will need to include an amplifier in your system. Amplifiers have separate channels to connect each speaker, and come in a range of power output levels. The more power, the clearer and louder the sound. Large boats requiring more than 4 speakers may need more than 1 amplifier.;
, Remember that upgraded features will cost you more, and that you have many to choose from:


Water proofing. All marine audio systems are weatherproof, meaning the electronic parts are poly coated and UV protected. However, not all systems are waterproof. If you feel that your stereo might be splashed with water on a regular basis, opt for a waterproof faceplate with a sealed gasket.
Remote control. You may choose between a wireless or wired remote. Also consider the line of sight necessary for the remote control to communicate with the receptor. You may need additional receptors that can be installed in a different location than the stereo itself.
Auxiliary inputs. You need these for any devices you may want to plug into your boat stereo system. Devices that are compatible with auxiliary inputs include mp3 players, DVD players and satellite radio.
iPod or CD changer controls. If you want to be able to control either of these devices by way of your stereo face, it will need to include specific controls.
Satellite radio. Some marine stereo systems include satellite radio receptors but, in many cases, you will have to buy a separate satellite radio system that is compatible with your stereo.

, 4 speakers is standard for most small to mid-sized boats. However, you may choose to install more speakers if you have a large boat, or if you desire very loud sound. Take the following aspects into consideration when choosing speakers:


Size. If you are upgrading existing boat speakers, then the speakers you purchase should fit into the pre-cut speaker holes on your boat. Otherwise, you may choose to cut larger holes for larger speakers. Remember to account for not only the size of the cutout, but also the depth of the speaker.
Installation. You may choose to install new speakers in existing speaker holes, or mount box speakers. Box speakers come in enclosures to protect them from the elements and can be mounted anywhere you desire.
Speaker quality. You have several choices when it comes to speaker quality, depending on the sound you want for your boat sound system. Dual cone speakers deliver a limited range of sound frequencies and are, therefore, relatively inexpensive. Coaxial speakers are 1 step up from dual cone speakers, providing limited low to high range frequencies at a mid-level price point. Component speakers use separate speakers (in 1 speaker box) to handle each frequency, and produce high-quality sound. Subwoofers handle only bass frequencies and are only necessary if you desire a big bass sound.
Power handling. In order to avoid damaging your speakers, choose only speakers with a higher power handling capacity than the amplifier you will be using.

, Once you choose the components of your marine audio system, you will need to decide where to put the stereo, the amplifier, any special features that need to be installed and the speakers. Make sure you account for ease of access.

Consider the ability level of everyone in your group.,
Choose the time of year you want to go rafting.,
Consider your goals for your whitewater rafting trip.,
Consider your budget.",How to Choose Rafting Trips,"

To assist rafters in choosing an appropriate trip, there is an international scale that ranks rapids based on difficulty. Whitewater rapids vary in range from Class I (very gentle water) through Class VI (high risk and for extremely experienced rafters only). You should limit yourself to rapids classes based on the needs of the least experienced rafter in your group.



 


Meet age and size requirements. Some rivers and trip providers have age and weight requirements for rafting. These requirements vary by whitewater rafting outfitter, by river, and even by season.






Many whitewater rafting outfitters recommend that rafters have swimming ability. While you will be required to wear a life jacket, make sure that you choose a trip that is appropriate for your swimming ability in case you fall out of the boat while navigating rapids.





;
,

In the summer, whitewater rafting trips can help you cool off. In the autumn, you may want to take a slower trip and enjoy seeing or photographing fall foliage. In the spring, you can enjoy spring flowers. Also in the spring, melting snow runoff can increase the rapids class on some rivers.






Like with many attractions, prices for whitewater rafting trips vary by season. Trips are generally more expensive in the summertime.







, If you're looking for adrenaline rush, choose a trip with a higher rapids class. If you want to enjoy nature, choose a trip with the sites you want to see. Some whitewater rapids trips offer multiple-day trips with rustic camping or scheduled stops at cabins overnight.

, Some rafting trips may be a day trip for you, while others would require travel and lodging. Do you own personal floatation devices and other equipment or do you need to rent them? Do you want a guided rafting trip or do you want to brave it alone? Would you like food provided as part of the trip? Will you want to purchase photos, t-shirt, and other souvenirs? You should consider the answers to all of these questions when planning a budget for your whitewater rafting trip.

Check that your equipment is sufficient for your journey.,
Make sure you have cast off all wires: electrical connections, phone connections, TV aerial connections.

,
On the single lever control, disengage the gearbox.,
When the engine is running smoothly, look around for dangers and untie the boat.,
With the single lever control in the neutral position, re-engage the gearbox.,
With the stern well clear of the bank, slowly and calmly move the throttle to its lowest forward setting (or just move the throttle a touch forward until you feel the gearbox engage, then move back to tickover).

,
Move the tiller slightly towards the bank.,
At low speed (perhaps very first forward ""notch""), get used to using frequent small corrections (quickly ""killed"") maintain the boat in a forward straight line.,
Once you think you have the hang of steering at the slowest speed, then allow yourself a little more power.,Keep to the centre of the canal, except to avoid moored boats, or to get to a position to see around a bend or obstacle, or to pass a boat.,
If a boat comes the other way, both boats should move gently about four feet to the right to keep the other boat on their left.,
To moor, first slow down to a constant slow speed.,
When nearly parallel, gently engage reverse gear.",How to Control a Canal Boat (Narrowboat),"

If you are going to be going through any locks then you will need a windlass, as well as anti-vandal and/or waterway authority keys to use some locks depending on the area.



 


If you are going onto a river, you will need an anchor and sufficient rope and chain for its use.





;
,, Open the throttle slightly, close the pressure relief valve (diesel engines), turn the key to on and check for voltage, ignition lights etc, turn the key to preheat for around half a minute (diesel engines), turn the key further (against the spring) to run the starter. If the engine does not start (or if you are uncertain about the procedure) then consult your boat manual. When the engine starts, leave it a few seconds, then return the throttle to idle (tickover).

,

In still water, ask the crew to untie the stern rope first (stern = back) then the bow rope (bow = front). The reason you cast off the bow rope last is that with the stern untied, you can still control it with the tiller and engine.






If there is a current, untie the downstream end first (the current will keep the boat safely against the bank, until the other end is untied).






If there is no wind or current, and the rest of the crew are asleep or doing the washing up: tie a centre rope, untie everything else, untie the centre rope, and step back on board at the tiller. A centre rope gives you full control of the boat (ie it can't drift out front or stern) provided there is no wind or current).







, Remaining in neutral, push the stern away from the bank. Many canals are shallower at the sides, and debris accumulates between your boat and the bank: so to keep rubbish and rocks away from your propeller, it is best to have the prop in deeper water before it starts turning. Also, the boat pivots near the middle, so unless the stern is clear of the bank, you will not be able to swing the bow out (and therefore the stern in) as you move forwards.

,, The tiller controls the position of the back of the boat, so this moves stern towards the bank, and the bow pivots out slightly towards the centre of the canal. Without speeding up, use small tiller corrections (tiller left, bow right) to get the whole boat to the centre of the canal and pointing straight forward. (At these low revs, the tiller is slow to respond, so ""small adjustments, wait, correct"" all slowly and gently).

,

Stand dead centre, and use the front of the boat like a sight along the canal






Make a small correction as soon as the front of the boat drifts off the centre of the canal, and hold it until the boat responds. (ie if the front drifts right, move the tiller a small distance right until you feel some resistance, then hold it there).






As soon as the boat starts to swing back, centre the tiller. The bow will continue back for a short while. Hopefully, by the time it stops, it will be pointing straight down the canal (if not, a smaller correction may be needed). (Do not delay the centering of the tiller until the bow is pointing in the right direction, by the the time the bow stops swinging, it will be pointing the OTHER wrong way.)






To move the tiller too far, or to delay re-centering it, results in a series of wider and wider curves which only stop when you hit the bank.







, Don't go beyond the speed at which you can correct swings or go round corners comfortably, or stop if a boat comes round the bend ahead. Don't go beyond the speed for a comfortable leisurely cruise. Above all, do not create a breaking wash (erodes the canal bank, and fills the canal with silt) and do not break the speed limit for where you are (4 mph (6.4 km/h) on British canals).

,, There is no need to move out of the way at great speed, and no need to crash into the trees in an attempt to get away. All that is required is to move positively (so the other boat can see that you are moving the right way) and to ensure that as you pass, you keep a foot or two of water between you. The boat nearest the towpath should keep close to it (unless the bottom is obviously shallow there) to allow the other boat to keep off the other bank (and away from overhanging trees). Do not slow down too much, or steering will become less positive - and do not get too close, or the boats can get sucked together., Aim the towards the bank at about 30 degrees. When 5 or 6 feet (1.5 or 1.8 m) away from the bank, gently steer away, so that the boat continues approaching the bank but is gradually straightening up.

, With luck (and then with practice!) the boat comes to a complete stop perfectly parallel to the bank with only a few inches between the boat and the bank. Tie up securely.

Unscrew the bolt at the side of the crank arm with a socket wrench.,
From here, you may have to wiggle the crank or tap it with a hammer and work the crank off of the spindle of the bottom bracket.,
When using a crank wrench (highly recommended): tighten the bolt into the spindle with a crescent wrench, before you insert the second part of the tool.,
Clean the spindle mounting surfaces and put a small amount of lithium grease on the spindle to keep the metals from binding.

Carry a backpack or messenger bag.,
Strap, screw, zip-tie, or Velcro items directly to the frame or handlebar.,
Install a rack on your bike.,
Install a basket.,
Use an under-seat bag.,
Use a handlebar bag.,
Use saddle bags or panniers.,
Consider a cargo bike.,
Consider a cargo trailer.",How to Carry Cargo on a Bike1,"

This is a particularly easy way to carry stuff, because backpacks and messenger bags are very easy to find, if you don't already have one.
Backpacks and messenger bags can easily go with you when you get where you're going.
On the other hand, the weight of your cargo is on your body, and a bag or backpack holds sweat against your body, so backpacks may be best for short, casual rides and moderate loads.
Carrying a loaded backpack while cycling also raises your center of gravity and can cause balance issues while riding.;
, Many purpose-built bike accessories are designed to attach this way, including water bottle cages, frame pumps, lights, bike computers, and bells.

Rubber shims can keep strapped-on things from slipping or twisting, and can take up some of the difference if a plastic or metal strap is a little larger than what it's fastening to. If shims didn't come with your accessory, ask at your local bike shop, or cut pieces from an old inner tube.
Some frame pumps are designed to mount to the same screws as the water bottle cage.

,

A few racks attach only to the seat post. Most attach to standard mounting points on the frame near the rear axle.
Some racks attach near the front wheel or in front of the handlebars.
Some racks have a spring-loaded holder, sometimes called a ""rat trap.""
For loose items, you may need bungee cords or other tie-downs to secure them to a rack.

,

Handlebar baskets attach to the handlebars. They're good for small, light loads, such as a small handbag. They also let you see and access the contents easily.
Rear baskets attach to rear racks. Many can be folded flat when not in use.
Baskets may be used in combination with liners or bags, to prevent small objects from falling through openings.
Read the instructions and use good judgment to avoid overloading baskets meant for lighter loads.

,

These bags are usually smaller. They strap or clip to the seat post, and to the rails on the bottom of the seat post.
Under-seat bags make good, out-of-the-way places to keep basics, such as a patch kit and tire levers. Some larger ones could also carry a pack lunch, a windbreaker, or other small items.

,

As the name suggests, handlebar bags strap or hang from the handlebar.
Handlebar bags are good for smaller, lighter objects, and they keep objects at hand.
Some handlebar bags include transparent pockets for maps, route sheets, or phones.

,

Most saddle bags and panniers require a compatible rack to connect to. Make certain that the rack is suited to the load you will carry.
These bags hang to either side of the wheel. They can be used singly or in pairs.
Most panniers go on a rear rack, but some are designed to mount in front, as well.
It's possible to have more than one pair of panniers, and you might wish to have both if you are carrying camping gear for touring.

, Some purpose-built bikes are designed to carry cargo, with built-in, reinforced platforms or containers., Cargo trailers are not necessary for smaller loads, but they can help carry a wide variety of large and heavy objects.

Cargo trailers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, so shop around or build the trailer that is right for you and your purposes.The occasional warehouse club purchase may call for a light-duty trailer. If you plan on moving major appliances or larger furnishings, you'll need a larger trailer designed for a heavier load.
Trailers built for children or pets can also carry objects of an appropriate size and weight. The reverse is not necessarily true.
An empty trailer can bounce and rattle while riding. Even a small load, such as a full backpack, can help.
Make sure to secure the trailer completely and correctly to the bike.
Make sure to secure the load on the trailer.
Center the load over the axle of the trailer, or load it so there is slightly more weight on the end nearest the bike.

"
"
Put heavier items closer to the ground to keep your center of gravity low.,
Don't put so much weight on your front wheel that it causes you to over steer, or steer rigidly.,Balance the load on each side of your bike.,
Check shoe clearance.",How to Carry Cargo on a Bike2," If you're going to be carrying something heavy, it's better to put it in a pannier than on top of a rack, for example., On the other hand, putting too much weight on the back can cause the front wheel to come off the ground. This is a less likely problem, however.,, As you turn, your feet might catch on bags."
"
Push open the quick release lever.,
Pull the skewer straight out by pulling on the quick release lever.,
Lube the shaft and threads of the skewer with bearing grease.

,
Insert the skewer into the wheel with the quick release lever facing in the proper direction, which is usually the left side of the bicycle.",How to Change a Quick Release Skewer," This will loosen the skewer. Locate the cap at the opposite end of the skewer, and unscrew it until the wheel falls out of the dropouts. Continue unscrewing the cap until it is completely detached from the skewer threads. Set aside the cap in a place where it will not get lost. If you purchased a new skewer, don't worry about the cap for the old skewer.;
, Take off the spring, and clean the skewer at this point if you intend to reuse it. If you are replacing a quick release skewer, set aside or dispose of the old one.

,, Put the spring on with the smaller end aiming toward the wheel. Gently compress the spring with the cap, and slowly turn the cap just enough to get it attached without falling off. Put the wheel into the dropouts, and finish tightening the cap.

Consider the purpose of your bike.,
Realize the primary price determinant in choosing a bike is the type of the frame and the quality of the components.

,
Decide whether you're more focused on comfort or performance.,
Pay attention to wheels.,
Learn the different component types.,
Find two or three bikes in your price range.,
Keep in mind that there will be very little difference in the actual geometry of the frames, and that all new bikes, whether they are $100 or $10,000 will shift smoothly.,
Your local bike shop will fit the bike to your body and riding style by getting you to, A.,
Avoid getting obsessed with finding the perfect bike.",How to Buy a Suitable Road Bike," If you plan to use the bike for camping or commuting, a touring bike to carry your belongings will better suit your purpose.;
,, Some people will tell you that ""Steel frames offer a more comfortable ride. Aluminum weighs less, and is more efficient, but is less comfortable. Carbon fiber offers the best in comfort and performance, but is out of the $1000 price range."" The quality of a frame varies drastically, so the above is not always true. Frame geometry and design are also important.

, Not only do they have a considerable impact on the ride feel of the bike, they are also a significant portion of the weight equation. Not only do they weigh as much or more than the frame, they account for rotating weight, which has a much larger effect on the ease of acceleration than the fixed mass of the frame. If you can find a bike with light, strong wheels, it will be a great bonus. Ask your bike shop what kinds they recommend.

, At $1,000 your best hope is to get most or all Shimano Tiagra components. Shop around to compare specs, but components are only one aspect of a road bike.

, Ride each bike to determine which fits you best. Bear in mind that if you have never ridden a proper road bike before they will all feel uncomfortable at first, so get some advice on fit from someone with a bit of experience.

, So what you want to pay attention to as you test ride the bikes are the ride 'feel', and the fit/setup of the bike.

, Stand over the frame, and B. ride the bike (possibly in a trainer) and adjusting the seat (height, forward / back), and handlebars (height, stem length). Keep in mind that there are several variables in the fit of the bike. The distance from the seat to the pedals is directly related to your leg length, and they will adjust that distance by raising or lowering the seat. The distance forward to the handlebars, and the height of the handlebars is not so easily adjustable, and is set first by the size and geometry of the frame, along with the stem. Get the position about right with the frame size, and fine-tune the fit by swapping out stems.

, You will have to make trade offs. Even though bikes in the $1000 price range are very good, you won't get the best of everything. If you think you won't be completely satisfied with the bike you'll get for $1000, consider buying one with a nicer frame, but lower spec components; they will be easy to upgrade one by one as you get the money.

Unless you are very meticulous or lucky, there will be some chain alignment problems.",How to Build an Inexpensive Electric Bicycle," Make sure it is comfortable and has good brakes. Any problems the bike has when you start are going to be magnified once it has 40 pounds of electric ""stuff"" added to it and an extra horsepower pushing it around. It'll be harder to stop and the ride will be rougher. Full suspension department store bikes actually work well, but you'll probably want to change the low-pressure knobby tires to some higher-pressure street tires (going from 35 to 65psi makes a huge difference! This is a cheaper way to get extra range rather than buying more batteries). For this bike build, you want a bike with some space in the triangle between the rider's legs.;
, Alternatively, you can get the crank and sprockets from another bike and transplant them to the side of *your* bike that has no sprockets.

, This is where your batteries will go. Want some extra storage capacity? You can use U-bolts and some cheap plastic, rectangular trash cans from a place like Big Lots. Just attach them to the side of the rack using the U-bolts.

, You need to know the voltage of your battery pack before you start buying the other parts. 24 volts and 36 volts are very common voltages for electric bikes. You can go higher but all the parts start to get more expensive and harder to find. The easiest to obtain and cheapest batteries are small gel cell lead acid batteries often used in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). These come rated at 12 volts and 7 to 12 amp-hour capacity. Car batteries won't work! First off, if they turn over, the acid can spill out. In addition, they're built to be used hard for a few seconds, rather than lightly for a long time, and they will not last.

, Multiple batteries can be wired together in ""series"" to get a higher system voltage and in ""parallel"" to get a higher system amp hour rating. Mouser.com stocks 12volt, 7 amp hour batteries for around $25 usually. Get some braided copper cable to attach the batteries together. Solid core wire like Romex (used for wiring household electrical stuff) will not survive the vibration of a moving vehicle.

, You can probably get one at the same place you get the following items... (On the other hand, for lead acid batteries, a car charger will work, but you will need to charge each battery separately).

, Most motors come with no sprocket or a sprocket that only fits No. 25 or No. 35 chain (which is used on go-karts and scooters). Sticking to bicycle chain will make your life a lot easier. The Unite MY1018 is available as a 250Watt-350Watt motor on several scooter parts stores online.

,, It's more likely the connectors on the throttle and controller will match if they come from the same place. If in doubt, ask the store. Sometimes you need to buy the connectors separately.

, This is usually difficult, so the backup solution is to get some Anderson Power Pole connectors from a place like Newark.com, cut off the connector that comes with the controller, and just use the Anderson.

, Aluminum is much lighter and easier to work with than steel, but it's more expensive. The dimensions will vary on your bicycle's triangle.

, The tubing size varies so you'll have to measure it. These are likely called ""stainless steel plumbing clamps"" at your local big box home improvement store.

,,,,, Attach the throttle to the controller, then the motor to the controller, connect the batteries together, and then connect the batteries to the controller.

, The - from the 1st and the + from the 2nd battery are now 24v apart!

, Don't ever make a complete circuit with the batteries alone (there should always be two wires hanging out freely!), they will discharge quickly, melting wires, leaking, burning your fingers, and possibly starting a fire!

, The motor should spin. If it doesn't, recheck all the connections. Be patient, a wrong move here can be costly.

, You'll forget by the next morning.

, The idea is to mount the MY1018 motor in the triangle formed by the bike's frame and attach a chain from the motor to a crank sprocket. Which sprocket? The choice will depend on alignment.

, The master link is used to connect the two ends of the chain together, but only every other link can be replaced with a master link, so make sure the motor is positioned correctly. It should be snug but not tight. If it is loose or sloppy, it will tend to fall off during hard acceleration or going uphill.

, Get out a sharpie and draw where you will need to cut the plate for the motor to fit and for the plate to fit on the bicycle. The motor will bolt to the plate, and the plate should touch the bicycle's frame at 3 points-- any less and it will not stay in place.

, A grinder will help clean things up. A hand file is time consuming but works too, especially on aluminum.

, You'll probably have to go back to the grinder again a few times.

, It's very hard to get all 3 holes just right the first time around, just try to get two right and then re-drill the 3rd hole until it lines up. You might need to get the grinder back out again.

, Remember the three spots that touch the frame? Now you'll need to drill or cut holes at those three points so you can attach the plate to the frame using the hose clamps. A dremel with a cutting wheel works very well. A drill works too but requires making a lot of holes in a straight line.

, Either use a chain tool to shorten the chain or cut the chain (the cheap Walmart chain tools will work for two or three uses). You can remove the damaged link with a nail, hammer, and a vise.

, You can no longer change gears on the front sprocket because then the two chains would collide, so adjust the shifter to prevent this from happening (or just cover it with duct tape). Once all the ""mechanical"" pieces are worked out, go for a test ride to make sure nothing is stuck and the chain doesn't fall off.

, Zip ties are perfect for this.

, The hardest part about mounting the throttle is getting the hand grips off. There's an easy way to do this. Get something thin and stiff-- an old bicycle spoke or coat hanger are perfect-- insert it between the grip and the handlebar, then pour some 50/50 water, and dish soap mixture down the coat hanger. It will work its way under the grip, you can then twist it around, and it will come off.

, Usually, there is an allen head set screw to tighten the throttle to the handlebar. Tighten it.

,,, Attach the battery pack to the controller per the instructions that came with it. Twist the throttle. Does the motor spin? Does the bicycle's rear wheel spin? Let go of the throttle. Does the motor stop spinning? If you didn't secure the wheels off the ground, you might now find the bike taking off across the garage without you on board.

, You'll probably need to make some revision after riding a few times.

, Duct tape doesn't hold up in the sun and rain, and it leaves a gooey mess behind.

, This is where washers come in handy. To be honest, you'll find things stretch after riding for a little bit, so you'll probably have to make adjustments after the first few rides, so don't expect to ride to a job interview on your first trip or anything else important.

Refer to this for exact instructions regarding your specific bike.If you don’t have an owner’s manual, check the manufacturer’s website. Many post instructions for assembly there.;
, Before you begin, make sure you have everything you need. Double-check the box’s contents with the parts listed in your owner’s manual. If anything is missing, contact the seller and notify them.Don't throw anything away until you’re finished. Smaller parts could possibly be hidden in the box or protective wrapping.

, Again, refer to the owner’s manual to double-check which tools are required for assembly. Expect types and sizes to possibly vary according to the make and model. However, generally speaking, you will most likely need:Allen keys
Cable cutters
Phillips head screwdriver
Wrench

, Check your manual to find out which parts should be lubricated (and with which type of lubricant). Inspect your bike to locate any metal parts that will come into direct contact with other metal parts. Apply lubrication here to reduce damage from friction and corrosion. Such areas will probably include parts like the:Axles
Quill stem
Seat post
Seat tube
Threads

, Inspect the post attached to your seat's saddle. Locate the mark that indicates how far this should be inserted into the seat tube. If desired, you can place it deeper than this for a lower seat, but always insert it at least this much to make sure your seat is securely in place.If you want a higher seat than the insertion mark allows, you will need to purchase this separately.

, First, grease the seat post if you haven’t already. Slip it into the corresponding tube on the bike’s body. Push it in until the minimum insertion mark is inside the tube., Depending on the make and model, there should be either a bolt or a quick release mechanism on the outside of the seat tube. Whichever one it is, tighten this once you’ve inserted the post to your desired depth. Secure the seat post in place so it isn’t jarred out of place as you ride., Once the post is secure, move up to the seat’s saddle. If needed, adjust its position so it’s centered over the post. Then tighten its bolts to fix it., Locate the wheel mounting slots and axle on the bike’s fork for the forward wheel. Make sure they’re facing away from the bike itself. If they aren’t, simply twist the fork around until they are., Before you attach it to the bike’s body, make sure the handlebar isn’t able to move on its stem. Adjust it so it’s positioned as though you were riding forward in a straight line. Then tighten the stem bolts to fix it in this position., If your bike has any brake or shift cables attached to the handlebar, give them a quick inspection. Double-check to be sure that they haven't become tangled up or knotted. If needed, undo any knots or twists., First, refer to your owner’s manual to determine if your handlebar has a quill stem or an A-head. Each requires different steps to attach it to the bike’s body. Depending on which you have:Quill stem: Lubricate the stem with grease. Locate the minimum insertion mark on the wedge-shaped part at its bottom. Insert this into the bike’s corresponding tube. Make sure the handlebar is aligned with the fork, then tighten the stem center bolt.
A-head: Locate the stem cap, undo its bolts, and remove the cap. Fix the handlebar on top of the stem. Replace the cap and bolts and retighten them.

, Go over each side of the wheel. Look along the rims. Confirm that the tires are evenly placed over the rims. Adjust if necessary., First, find their recommended air pressure, which should appear on the tire itself. Then remove their caps and fasten your bike bump to the valve. Inflate them slowly so you don’t go over the recommended air pressure and burst your tire by accident.

, Once the tires are inflated, give them a spin. Make sure they’re still seated evenly over the rims once they come to a stop. If not, release the air, readjust the tires, and repeat until they’re in the proper position once inflated. Replace the valve cap when you’re all done., Center the wheel evenly between its fork and place it into the front fork’s drop outs. Open the brake to do so if necessary. Tighten all bolts. As you do, tighten each just a little bit at a time, move on to the others and tighten them just as much, and repeat until you’re all done. Then double-check that the wheel is still centered between the fork.Instructions for this step possibly vary the most between designs. Refer to your owner’s manual for precise steps for your specific wheel.

, First, identify which is which by checking the spindles. Find the L and R markers respectively. Use the L pedal on the bike’s left side and the R pedal on its right (which would be your left and right when seated on the bike). To attach them:Screw each pedal onto its corresponding thread with your hands at first (turning clockwise for the right pedal and counterclockwise for the left). Then switch to a wrench to tighten them firmly into place as you near the end., If your bike has gears, raise the back tire off the ground. Turn the pedals and shift through all the gears as you do. Make sure each one shifts to the next smoothly. If they don’t, set the bike to its highest gear before making your adjustments., Locate the brake pads. Keep your eyes on these as you turn your pedals. Squeeze the brake lever and make sure that:The brake pads make contact on the rim without interference.
They do so when the brake lever is only a third of the way to making contact with the handlebar.
Each pad retreats the same distance from the rim when you let go of the level.

, First, make sure any gear or brake levers are in front of your handlebar, at a 45 degree angle between the bar and the ground. Squeeze them to make sure they’re working properly. Then set both wheels on level ground. Check the angles of both the front and back reflectors. If necessary, adjust them so they’re at least within five degrees of being perfectly vertical with the ground.At this point, you should be done assembling. However, inspect your handiwork step-by-step before using your bike. Make sure that you haven’t overlooked anything or made any mistakes.

Buy a road bike for riding mainly on roads and highways. Road bikes have lighter frames and slimmer tires. They are not designed to ride over rough terrain, so they don't have suspension systems that absorb shock. Road bikes are a good fit for riders with a strong back. Flexibility is needed due to bent over riding position.



 


Choose a mountain bike for riding on trails or mountain biking. The tires are large with significant tread, which helps to grab the surface and propel you forward when you're going uphill. Also, the frame is heavier, and the bike has a suspension system to absorb shock. Most mountain bike handlebars are straight and can create discomfort if rode long distance on paved trails.






Pick a hybrid bicycle if you want something in between. They combine the low gearing of a mountain bike into a bike that sint excessively uncomfortable on the road or on easier trails. Most hybrids have an upright riding position. Some hybrids come with double walled rims can handle some off road riding but nearly all of them can be adjusted for either road or trail riding. Tires play the most important part in that regard.;
, Be honest about your current ability, and consider where you'd like to be in the future. Purchase a bike that's right in the middle of your current skill level and your ideal vision of yourself.

, You can always purchase a used bike if you're on a budget. Try to find a bike shop with a trade in program.


Used bikes are often better value for money. If given the choice between a new bike priced at 150 euros and a used bike of the same price then the used bike is often the better choice.

, If you have friends who are cyclists, ask them for recommendations before you buy a bicycle. If you don't know any cyclists, then e-mail your local cycling club.

, Online is a great option to consider when buying a bike. Because online retailers don't necessarily have to showcase and stock their bikes, they can pass on the savings to in the form of a cheaper price.


Compare frames and components so that you are familiar with the important parts of a bike. You should primarily look for a good frame. You can always upgrade components later. Getting the right fit is extremely important. Most bike shops are there to help you get started and will guide you. Don't go in with online printouts. Bike shops cannot compete with high volume. They offer service and certified technicians.







, Are you too stretched out? Are the controls easy to use and reach? How do you feel? What is your overall impression?


The only way to see if a frame is the right size for you, without measuring, is to ride the bike for a long period of time. More often than not, this isn't possible.
Notice the distance from the seat to the bottom of the pedal stroke and the angle at which you have to lean to hold the handlebars.
The frame size of the bike is fixed, so take the time to try several different options to find the best fit.

, A slimmer tire is better for quick riding, and a slicker tread is better for city riding over smoother surfaces. For safety and convenience, look for tires that have built-in flat protection.

, Like a car, a bike is usually something you want to try out before you purchase it. It might look nice and dandy, but if it doesn't feel good and respond to your body in the proper way, what's the use?


Consider the weight of the frame. A lighter frame is easier to propel but will also be more expensive.






Your body should feel comfortable as you ride. Your knee should bend slightly at the bottom of the pedal revolution. You should be able to reach the brakes easily, and your upper body shouldn't feel cramped on a flat surface.






Make sure that the bicycle handles turns smoothly and that you can sit and stand easily while you're on a hill.







, Find out what types of bikes they sell, and choose a shop that specializes in the kind of bike that you want. It might be helpful to have a budget in mind.

, Tell the salesperson your goals, and ask for recommendations.

Be wary of a salesperson who steers you toward a significantly different type of bike, particularly if that bike is out of your price range.
At the same time, listen to suggestions. For example, if the salesperson recommends a slightly different frame style than the ones you've researched, ask why. If the salesperson has a good explanation, then consider the suggestion.

, Many shops, for example, offer a year of free tune-ups along with your purchase.

, If you printed prices from online source, then show the prices to the salesperson to see if the shop will match the price. If the shop offers you a slightly lower price or throws in a service plan, then you may have a good deal.

, With an online purchase, you get to shop 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You're also more likely to find a competitive price.


Look for retailers in your area who have brick-and-mortar stores as well as online purchase options. That way, you can test drive the bike at the store and then buy the bike you want online.
Check out sites like eBay, Bicycle Peddler and Craigslist for used bikes.

EBay can be a great choice because, since you'll be bidding on the bike, you'll stick with your budget. You will have to pay for shipping if you don't buy from a local salesperson.
Craigslist can also be great because you can pick up your bike locally, and you probably won't have to assemble it. You'll also have the chance to test drive it before you buy it.
Bicycle Peddler is also a good place to look. The site is just starting out but has one of the best advanced searches for both new and used bike.,


If your bike comes in pieces, take it to your local bike shop and pay someone to assemble it for maximum safety. Even if your bike comes from another retailer, you will still need to develop a relationship with your local bike retailer in case you need future assistance.Test drive the bike after it's put together. If you don't like it, and you bought it from a retailer, disassemble it and ship it back or return it to a brick-and-mortar store.

Plan out your route ahead of time, including transitions, walking, biking, and time of day.,
Call ahead or check your train's website to see if they accept bikes.,
Allow extra time to get to your destination.,
Pay the correct fare.,
Stand on the platform.,
Board the train with your bike, standing along the side.,
Follow subway and train etiquette.",How to Take Your Bike on the Train1," Unfortunately, there is no standard procedure when taking bikes on public transit. Some trains allow it, some only on certain hours, and other never at all. Coupled with any transitions you might make, such as switching to a bus or light-rail, and it may seem easier to skip the bike altogether. However, knowing your entire route in advance will make planning far easier. Google and Apple maps, for example, have extensive public transportation and bike maps that let you know all available routes, even mixed routes, after you type in your destination address.


If you need to take a bus, does the bus system accept bikes?
How far are you traveling when you get off the train? It might make more sense to lock the bike at the station if you get right off at your destination.;
, Find out if there are any fees, restrictions, or requirements. The most frequent restrictions include:


Only riding in bike-designated cars.
No bikes during peak hours, frequently 8-10AM and 4-6PM
No bikes on crowded or packed cars., Getting your bike up and down the stairs, through turnstiles, and on the train will inevitably take a little extra time, so plan accordingly. For short trips, and extra 5-10 minutes should be more than enough to get you there on time.Many stations do not let you bring a bike on an escalator for safety reasons, so be prepared to potentially haul up and down stairs.

, Purchase the fare for your trip, including fees for bringing your bike. Many trains require an additional amount to cover the bike.


If you can't get in the turnstile with your bike, signal the attendant. You can usually swipe your card/pay the fare, then enter through the emergency or handicapped entrance after paying., Stand with your bike on the platform behind the boarding line until the train comes to a stop. Wait for other passengers to exit and enter before boarding.

, Stow it away from doors and aisles, in a position where it won’t fall over and you can keep a hand on it. Try to turn the handlebars so that the wheels are in a straight line, out of the way of as many people as possible.


Use bike racks on the train if they are available, which usually involve wedging or lifting your front wheel into a small rack.
If there are other bikes on the train, place your front wheel near their back. These allows the bikes to fit together better and keeps the handlebars from jamming into each other.
Be sure your bike is secure if you're not holding it yourself. Don't leave it where other passengers can trip over it or run off with it. Make sure you can keep an eye on it.

, The unwritten rules of a good train passenger will keep everyone happier as you move too and fro. When carrying a bike, let others on and off before you, respect the rules (no riding during rush hour or on crowded trains) and politely ask people move or adjust their bikes if you think you can fit them more snugly. And, if the ride is short and the train is crowded, just ride home. That's why you have the bike, after all."
"
Check your train's bike policy before booking a ticket.,
Know that you may need to pack your bike in a box.,
Weigh all of your checked bags and the bike before you leave home.,
Show up well ahead of time to get your bike on the train.,
Consider shipping your bike long distances.",How to Take Your Bike on the Train2," Amtrak, for example, lets you pack a bike in a box for $10, carry folding bikes on as luggage, and even offers several trains with walk-on bike cars. Every company is different, however, so don't just buy a ticket and expect your bike to get on easily. You need to do your homework ahead of time to make sure you can transport your bike effectively.Expect a handling fee for bicycles, especially if they are not boxed up.

, This involves removing all the pieces, stripping off the handlebars, wheels, and pedals so that the bike fits in a large box. While you can usually get old boxes for free or cheaply by inquiring at your local bike shop, entrepreneurial packers can potentially fit the bike very large TV or appliance boxes.


If you are uncomfortable with bike mechanics, you may want to get your local shop to break down the bike for you. You can then take the bike to a local shop at your new location to get it back together, for a small fee.

, This may be important for ensuring you're not carrying too much on board. Check the train service's website for any weight restrictions. Amtrak, for example, has a 50lb limit. This, however, should be more than enough for your bike.


If you cannot weigh the bags at home, most Post Offices have a large scale you can use before you leave.

, Talk to the staff at the station about where you need to be, protocol, and tagging your bike so you can get it later. For longer trips, or anything requiring that you dismantle your bike and pack it in a box, arrive an hour before departure.

, Many bike shops will break down, package, and ship your bike across the country for you at a nominal fee, usually $20-30 plus shipping. Shipping, however, can get expensive. If you want to do it yourself, you should remove the wheels, handlebars, seats, and pedals and pack them into a bike box or large TV box, then ship the package from a post office, UPS, or FedEx.

"
Know that threadless headsets can be adjusted very much.,
Adjust your stem height to your comfort level, not a ""right"" location.,
Loosen the stem cap, the bolt pointing up where the stem meets the bike.,
Loosen the bolts on each side of the stem.,
Pull the stem off of the bike frame.,
Add or remove the circular risers to bring the handlebars to the desired height.,
Slid the handlebar stem back over the spacers.,
Insert the stem cap bolt and tighten it by hand.,
Align the stem with the front wheel.,
Check your headset alignment.",How to Adjust Handlebars1," To keep bikes from unnecessary weight, many stems (the connecting, L-shaped piece between your bars and bike) do not have a lot of excess room. If you want to make a larger change to your handlebar height, you will need to purchase a new stem from your local bike shop. If you have serious comfort issues, such as reaching too far or not far enough to your bars, you should consider a longer or shorter stem.


Threadless headsets have one big bolt on the top and two smaller bolts that help clamp the stem down. If your bike only has one continuous piece of metal connecting the bike to the bars then you have a threaded headset.;
, Let your body be the best judge of where you need the handlebars. Your back shouldn't be hunched or bent and your arms should be slightly bent at the elbows. Otherwise, ride how you feel comfortable. Have a friend hold the bike in place by gripping the front wheel between their thighs as you climb into the seat to test the handlebars. Generally, regardless of mountain or road biking:


Racing riders have low handlebars so they can crouch aerodynamically. They are usually below the seat 2-4"".
Comfort riders or beginners will have handlebars level with the seat or higher., Take an Allen key and remove the bolt on the stem cap. This bolt keeps the handlebars on the bike, and you need to remove it to raise or lower your bars. Remove the long bolt and take off the cap, then set them both aside safely for later.

, Use an Allen Key to loosen the two side screws on your handlebars. They will be on the part of the stem closest to your seat. Loosen them enough so that you pull the handlebars and stem off the tube in the frame.

, Slowly remove the handlebars, taking care not to stress or bend any of the wires attached to the brakes and derailleurs. These usually have a little bit of extra slack, but to be safe you should roll the bike up to a table or chair and place the handlebars down carefully, close to the bike.

, These spacers are all you have to adjust the height on threadless headsets. They are small rings that you add to gain height and remove to lower the bars. The conical piece that the bottom of the stem and connects to the frame, however, is the bearing cover and cannot be removed.You can buy more spacers at your local bike shop if you need the handlebars to get higher.

, Don't worry too much about aligning the bars perfectly just yet. If you removed any spacers, put them on top of the stem so that you don't lose them. The stem cap bolt will then cover them.

, You do not need to crank the bolt down, as hand tightness is perfectly fine. This top bolt does not affect the side-to-side movement of the handlebars, so you should tighten it before trying to get the handlebars aligned again.


If you are working with delicate pieces, like a carbon fiber frame, you should have a torque wrench to make sure you don't crack anything.Make sure you can turn the handlebars freely. If not, you should loosen the head bolt slightly until you can easily turn the bike.

, Stand over the bike with the frame between your legs, and squeeze the front wheel so that it is facing directly ahead. Close one eye and adjust the handlebars so that the centerpiece is aligned exactly with the front wheel. You want your wheel and handlebars to be in line for proper turning control.


If you are having trouble keeping the bars in place, tighten the nuts a quarter turn so that you need more pressure to spin the handlebars, yet they still move independently of the wheel.Tighten the bolts when you are done and the handlebars are aligned.

, The headset, remember, is the entire collection of piece (handlebars, stem, fork, front wheel) that turns your bike. The top bolt attaches to the headset of your bike, which affects your turning. To check it, stand with the bike between your legs and clamp the front brakes down. Turn the wheel back and forth and feel for any rocking or odd movement beneath your hands. If you feel any, loosen the side bolts, tighten the top bolt a little more, then retighten the sides to check again.


If you are struggling to turn or feel a ""tight-spot,"" loosen the top bolt a little."
"
Know if you have a threaded headset.,
Loosen the bolt on the top of the stem.,
Loosen the locknut with a wrench.,
Pull the handlebars out of the frame.,
Wipe down and grease the stem lightly.,
Consider the kind of riding you'll be doing when deciding a new handlebar type.,
Place the stem back at your desired height and tighten the hex nut and top bolt.",How to Adjust Handlebars2," Threaded headsets have one continuous metal piece (stem) that comes up out of the frame, bends forward, and then attaches to the handlebars. There is a nut where the stem leaves the frame that holds it in place and one bolt at the top of the stem. These stems are easy to adjust and are common on single-speed, fixed gear, and older bikes.


Some bikes do not have a hex nut by the frame, and just have the bolt on the top of the stem.

, This bolt, pointing straight down, creates the pressure that holds the stem in place. Use an Allen key to loosen in, though your don't need to remove it entirely., Disengage the hex nut, which is the ""ring"" where the stem meets the bike frame, by loosening it with a wrench.

, You may need to wiggle, twist, and pull to get them out. If this is a new bike, mark the location where the handlebars used to rest with a marker or measurement so that you can return to this location if you need.

, Clean off any gunk on the stem with soapy water and then dry it with an old rag. To prevent the stem from getting stuck in the frame later on, apply a little anti-seize grease around the bottom 2-3 inches of the stem., Proper handlebar positioning largely depends on the type of bicycle you're using. That said, the number one concern when picking a height is rider comfort. You should put the handlebars where you can comfortably ride every time.Road bike: Handlebars on racing bikes should be slightly lower than the seat to provide optimum aerodynamics and control at high speeds.
Mountain bike: Mountain bike handlebars should be lower than the seat. This gives you a lower center of gravity and better balance when negotiating rugged terrain.
Cruiser: Handlebars on standard bikes should be slightly higher than the seat to limit strain and provide maximum comfort.

, Hand tightness should be fine, especially with the top bolt. You don't want to crank on the bolt, making it so tight that you can't remove it later."
"
Check if your bike has an adjustable stem.,
Loosen the four screws at the end of the handlebar stem.,
Know how high you should angle your handlebars.,
Angle the handlebars to a comfortable height, lightly tighten them, and test.,
Tighten the bolts by hand once you've set the right angle.",How to Adjust Handlebars3," Adjustable stems have a single bolt running perpendicular to the bike where the stem meets the frame. You can loosen this bolt, adjust the stem angle, then tighten it back to quickly move your handlebars. If you have this option, adjust the stem and test it before moving on -- it may be enough to get you comfortable.

, The stem is the piece running perpendicular to your handlebars that attaches your frame to the handles. On the front of the bars (as if you were looking at the bike from straight ahead) are four screws, usually clamped to a small square plate on the center of the bars. Loosen these and the handlebars will be able to rotate up and down.

, You should feel like you could comfortably play piano on your handlebars. You want your arms slightly bent and you should be able to quickly and comfortably reach the brakes. Your back should be at a roughly 45-degree angle from your waist. Have a friend support the bike while you climb onto the seat and check your handlebar position.


Angling the handlebars is a minor adjustment. If you can't reach the brakes, have to bend over uncomfortably, or must extend your arms all the way, you will need to purchase a new handlebar stem. You may also be riding a bike that is too big for you., Have your friend hold the bike, or try a quick practice ride in a small area. Make sure you remember to tighten the bolts before beginning, however, as your weight could force the bars to angle suddenly down and cause a crash.


In many ways, handlebar angle is a matter of personal preference. As long as you are comfortable, they will work.
If you've been having finger numbness when riding, consider tipping your bars up a little more. This puts less pressure on your palms that may cut off some circulation.

, You need them to be hand tightened enough so that the bars don't move when you ride. However, you do not want them to be so tight that you cannot remove the bolts later or the screws become stripped.


If you have a torque wrench you should set the bolts to 5nm strength."

Assess your riding abilities.,
Determine your transportation needs.,
Analyze your budget.,
Test different models in your budget.,
Buy a used recumbent bike if your budget is tight.",How to Buy Recumbent Bikes," Riders who enjoy commuting, racing or touring all have different needs that can be accommodated through different recumbent bike designs. In addition, physically-challenged riders should consider their unique requirements before purchasing a recumbent bike.


Limited mobility riders and beginners may want handlebars located below seat level, to put less stress on the back and neck muscles. One-handed controls can be incorporated near the leg area to enable wheelchair-bound riders to steer without handlebars.
Physically strong riders seeking a comprehensive workout may enjoy a recumbent bike with arm and leg pedals that enable a full-body workout.;
, Where you want to go and how you want to get there determines the best recumbent bicycle styles for your needs. Three popular designs dominate the marketplace.


Long wheelbase (LWB) recumbent bikes are good for low speeds and touring to long-distance locations.
Short wheelbase (SWB) bikes feature a compact design good for commuting and city riding.
Compact long wheelbase (CLWB) enable beginners to learn rapidly. Their higher seat-heights make riders more visible in traffic and the frame design is more stable than others.

, Recumbent bikes comprise a fraction of the bicycle market, which makes them more expensive than standard bicycles. Good quality beginner recumbent bicycles start at about $800 USD.


Recumbent bikes are often custom-made for riders' needs. The more customization, the higher the cost.
Riders seeking a lightweight recumbent bike will also pay considerably more than those who purchase a standard upright bicycle of the same weight.
A single recumbent bicycle style may not be suitable for riding on different terrain types, such as dirt and asphalt. You may want a second bicycle for activities like mountain biking.

, Visit a recumbent bicycle store or manufacturer to experience the different wheel bases, pedal and handlebar locations.


Visit the store during off-peak weekday hours to ensure you can practice riding in the parking lot. Allow ample time to try each model.

, Purchasing a pre-owned recumbent will enable you to talk to the owner and ask about their experience using the bicycle.


Call bicycle stores specializing in recumbent bikes to inquire about used models for sale. Checking classified advertisements such as craigslist.org can also help you locate your perfect bike.
Only buy a used recumbent bike after trying the model. Ensure that the bicycle is equipped to meet your needs, both physically and while in operation. Ask the owner why the recumbent is being sold.

Keep a close eye on your drivetrain.,
Clean your bike regularly to protect it from rust and damage.",How to Wash Your Bike," The drivetrain is the transmission of your bike. It is made up of four parts: a cassette (collection of gears on your back wheel), a rear derailleur (metal arm on the back wheel), chain rings (big gears next to your pedals), and the chain. The drivetrain gets you moving, but as dirt, rust and grime add up you become more prone to skipping and chain issues.


Frequent cleaning and maintenance of your drive train can add years to your bike's working lifespan.;
, You will need to get the chain moving on the bike to clean it properly. If you don't have a bike stand, flip the bike over on the seat and handlebars. Be sure to put a towel or rag that you don't mind getting dirty underneath the bike to avoid scuffing the seat or handles.

, Biodegreaser, otherwise known as biodegradable solvent, cuts through grime like soap but won't ruin or gum up your chain. You can find it at most bike stores, near the lubricant. Pour a little bit on your rag and clamp it over the chain, lightly enough that the chain can still freely move between your fingers. Pedal the bike with your other hand, running the chain for 2-3 cycles.








Run the chain through the rag 2-3 more times, placing pressure lightly with your fingers on the top, bottom, and both sides of the chain.
Knock off any patches of grease or grime with your rag if they are still visible.

, Gears need to be flossed to keep grime and dirt out of the cassette. Dip your brush into a mixture of water and biodegradable solvent and run it between each set of gears. If it is easier, hold the brush in place while you pedal with the other hand.









Use a screwdriver or pick to knock off built-up deposits from hard to reach areas.

, If it looks dirty, it's got to go. Use your damp rag, brush, and a little degreaser to get into as many nooks and crannies as you can and make your bike sparkling clean. Let the wheels do the work whenever possible by keeping the rag/brush in place and spinning the pedals. Commonly forgotten areas include:









The jockey wheels, the small cogs on the derailleur arm that need cleaning too.
The backside (closest to the bike) of the chain rings.
The bike frame, joints, and hinges near the chain., If a rag and a toothbrush don't cut it, you may need to buy a chain cleaning tool.You add degreaser to the box and clamp it over your chain. You can then hold the tool in place while pedaling the bike, which brushes and scrubs the chain links for you. They are usually $20-$30 and come with degreaser and a brush for hard to read areas., No matter how often you bike, you should always have a bottle of chain lube handy, which should both lubricate the chain and protect it from dirt and moisture. Slowly turn the pedals after cleaning and drying everything. Apply a single drop of lube to every 2-4 links, where one link meets another. Once you've hit the whole chain, shift through your gears and apply another 10-12 drops to make sure everything, cassette included, has a nice even coating. Use your rag to wipe up any excess lube from the chain when you are done, as extra lube can hold dirt and lead to grime. If you are going to clean the rest of your bike as well, wait and do this at the very end.









Your goal is a light coating of lube on the entire chain, not to drench it in lube. It should light coat your fingers if you touch the chain.Feel the chain with your fingers -- if it feels dry then you need to apply more lube.
Never use WD-40 on a bike chain -- it is not made for the weather or stress.

, Lay a mat or old sheet down on the ground to protect the seat and bars from dirt and scuff marks if you've turned it upside down. Make sure you are in an open, well-ventilated area that can get wet without ruining anything.

, You don't want to blast any of the dirt away, you simply want to wet the bike and remove and loose dirt and grime before you start scrubbing.


Never use a high-pressure hose or nozzle setting. This can force water into your components, causing internal rusting or de-lubricating important junctions., If you desire, you can also add a bike specific cleaner, but avoid using ordinary dish soap as it typically contains salt which can corrode parts of the bike, including the frame. You will want to use a different bucket and sponge than the ones used for your drivetrain. Grease from the chain and cassette will get on your frame if you don't use fresh supplies, ruining your clean-up job.

, You want to get into those as much as possible and you need to get on the inside of the frame with your sponge. The wheels make it difficult to clean the parts of the bike closest to the ground and tire, which are often the dirtiest areas.

, Scrub up and down the entire frame, which is the metal body of the bike, with a sponge and warm water. Never use a rough or abrasive brush on your frame, even with persistent stains. This can scratch your paint off and make the bike prone to rusting.









If there is a particularly tricky bit of grime, apply a small drop of soap or degreaser onto the spot with some water and let it soak for several minutes. Methodically scrub, in a circular motion, until you get it removed.
If you have caliper breaks (two black pads which pinch the top of the wheel), use the rough side of the sponge to remove any crud build up on them.
If you have disc brakes (attached metal disc to the wheels), wipe down both sides with the soft side of the sponge., The tires, which will become dirty again the second they touch the road, do not need to be cleaned. But the metal rim of the wheel can pick up gunk that gets in the way of your breaks. Use the abrasive side of a sponge to clean off the edges and lightly wipe down each spoke so your bike looks clean and sparkly.


Use a toothbrush to scrub the hub-- the small cylinder in the center of the wheel -- and the nuts and bolts on either side of it.
If you want to clean your tires, or you see large chunks of mud in the treads, use a big, heavy bristled brush (like the one sold with a dust pan)to clean them quickly and painlessly.

, The rear cassette is the collection of gears on the back of the bike. While you cleaned it briefly when you cleaned the drivetrain, you should take the time to make sure it is spotless when doing a full bike cleaning. Drip some soapy water into the cassette, then use a clean rag to ""floss"" in between each of the gears and remove any extra gunk built up deep in the cassette.

, You don't want water sitting around and pooling in your components. Take a clean, dry rag or towel and wipe up excess water. Focus on the joints and components -- anywhere where water could presumably sit for a long time. When you're done, put the bike back together and let it air dry, preferably in the sun.









If you were resting the bike on its saddle and bars, wipe these downs when you flip the bike back over before you start drying everything.
If you're cleaning your bike on a damp or cloudy day, take a little more time drying everything off.

, Bikes are made up of screws, pulleys, nuts, bolts, and cables, all of which need to function smoothly to keep you riding. Rust, dirt, and missing lubrication will cause your components to grind up against one another, increasing wear and tear and preventing you from a smooth ride. Being proactive about bike cleanings can save you a lot of time and money later on.


Wiping down your bike with a damp cloth after a dirty or muddy ride now can save you a lot of time and hassle doing a ""deep"" clean.

, Dry off your bike as best you can with a towel or clean rag and check the chain. Water and mud can get into your cassette and chain and cause major problems later on, but they are easiest to remove right after the ride. Pat down the chain and wipe away any dirt in the rings and derailleurs, then add 4-5 drops of added lubrication to make up for any that washed away.


Check you chain -- if it feels dry, take the time to do a full lubrication.

, Your chain isn't the only part of the bike that needs to stay lubed up to work well. While they don't need nearly as much lubricant to run smoothly, the following parts could use a short squirt of lube to run well.


Pivot points on your breaks, usually the part that holds the two sides together (caliper breaks only).
Use your fingers or a small rag to coat the cables in a thin layer of lube.
The shifters, if exposed. Make sure you only use bike lubricant., There are very few areas that get as dirty as a drivetrain, but this is probably the single most important area to keep clean. If you ride your bike daily a weekly or bi-weekly cleaning for your chain, cassette, and derailleurs is likely necessary.You will likely need to clean your drivetrain more often than the rest of the bike. At the very least you should check, clean, and potentially lube the chain every 1-2 weeks., You should wipe down and clean your bike monthly, at a minimum. A good benchmark is to go through a cleaning after every 20-25 rides or so. You can then perform a deep clean and re-lubricate everything 1-2 a year. That said, there are sometimes you should always clean off your bike--

Don’t be afraid to adjust the seat for every ride.",How to Raise a Bicycle Seat," Some bicycling shoes have thicker soles than others, and this can make a difference when figuring out how high your saddle should be. Even a small amount of thickness can make a difference in making it easier for you to pedal your bike. Professional bike shoes might have cleats that can give you a bit of added height, and this is important to calculate into your seat height.;
, Hold the handlebars yourself and also have someone hold the handlebars for you so that the bike doesn’t rock or tilt. Lift yourself up to sit on the seat. Your bicycle seat, or the saddle, is not intended to carry all of your weight. Rather, your weight should be distributed between the saddle, your legs and feet as they rest on the pedals, and through your arms and hands on the handlebars., Let your heel touch this pedal. Do not tilt the bike. There are different interpretations of what the ideal angle for your bent knee, but generally, bending your knee at a 5 degree angle (so you have a slight bend in your knee and your leg is not entirely extended) will be sufficient when you are sitting on the saddle and reaching the pedal when it is at the bottom of its rotation.

, Professional bicyclists often use formulas and calculations to determine the most ideal seat height. These include the Greg Lemond formula and the 109% formula, among others. Other professional riders consider these formulas to oversimplify the unique body structure of each individual rider, whose foot length, type of pedal, shoe thickness and other factors can have an impact on a comfortable seat height.Using a calculation can give you a basic idea of an appropriate height for your seat, however. Determine your seat height using one of these formulas and raise your seat to match the measurement. If you need to rock your hips while sitting on the bike in order to pedal, then your seat is too high.



Greg Lemond formula: This formula takes into account saddle height, shoe cleats, height of bicycle, and angles of the handlebars. To achieve ideal saddle height using the Greg Lemond formula, measure your inseam by measuring from the sole of your foot as it sits flat on the floor to your crotch. Don’t wear shoes for this measurement. Then multiply this measurement (in inches or centimeters) by 0.883. This will be the length between the center of the bottom bracket on the bicycle to the low point on top of the seat.109% formula: Using this formula, your ideal seat height is a calculation of 109% of your inseam. To measure your inseam, measure from the sole of your foot as it sits flat on the floor to your crotch. Don’t wear shoes for this measurement. Then multiply this number (in inches or centimeters) by 1.09 to find the appropriate number. This will give you the number of inches that should be between the top of your saddle to the pedal when it is at its lowest position., Look under the bicycle seat to see if you have a lever that you can pull out, or if you have a bolt that will need to be loosened with a ratchet or wrench. The seat post telescopes into the bicycle frame and is fairly loosely fit into what is called the seat tube. The seat post is held in the seat tube by a binder bolt or quick-release lever. If you have a quick-release lever, you don’t need any tools to continue raising your seat. If you have a bolt, you may need a wrench, ratchet or Allen wrench. Most seat posts need either a 13mm or 14mm wrench, or a 5mm or 6mm Allen wrench.Loosen the bolt by twisting the bolt to the left, or counterclockwise, direction.

, While you’re sitting on your bike with your legs in the proper position, lift the seat up to where you can comfortably sit on it. Ask a friend to mark the seat position on the post with a marker so you will be able place it at the right height once you’re off the bike.

, Move off the bike and move the seat to your marked position. The seat should slide up and down fairly easily, although you may need to wiggle the post a little bit to loosen it up. It should slide easily straight up and down. It is not suggested that you twist the seat from side to side, as this can cause scratches on the seat post. Pull the seat up to your optimum height.


Bicycle seats have a minimum insertion mark on their posts. This is the minimum amount that a seat post should be inserted into the bike frame, meaning that the seat cannot get any taller. If you need the seat higher or lower than it will actually go, your bicycle is the wrong size for you.
To adjust the seat height of a recumbent bicycle, sit in the seat with your riding shoes on. Straighten one of your legs almost fully onto the pedal, but keep a slight bend in your knee. Move your seat forward or backward to ensure you have a slight bend in your knee while sitting. Usually, a recumbent bike will have a lever under the seat that you lift when you move the seat.

, A seat post that is hard to move might have too much friction or a tight fit inside the seat tube. If this is the case, remove the seat post entirely and use a lubricant to grease the inside of the seat tube. If you have a carbon-fiber seat post, use a dry graphite powder lubricant, which is available online, automotive store, or at a home improvement store.If the seat post is totally stuck, look for the cause. It might be rusted, in which case you can use a lubricant or other oil for a steel frame to loosen it up, or ammonia if the frame is aluminum. If the seat post is the wrong size for the seat tube, you may need to pry the seat post out, possibly using a flathead screwdriver to assist you. Twisting the seat from side to side might also help loosen the seat. Once you get the seat post removed, either fully lubricate the post and the seat tube, or replace the seat post with a new one that fits better with your bicycle frame., The front pointed end of the seat should generally align with the frame of the bicycle. Look at the seat from above so you can see whether the seat lines up properly. Since all bodies are different, however, you might find it more comfortable to twist the seat a fraction to the left or right., Men often prefer a seat that tilts upward, while women are often more comfortable on a seat that tilts downward.This will be a minor tilt. Avoid the temptation to tilt the seat downward very much; even though it may be slightly more comfortable when sitting on the bike, it will actually cause more strain to your arms and shoulders. You may also have a tendency to slide forward when you ride if your seat is tilted too far down. This will cause you to push back with your arms and hands on the handlebars, further straining your arms as you ride.

, If your bike seat tightens with a bolt, use a wrench, Allen wrench, or ratchet to tighten the bolt. If your bike seat tightens with a quick-release lever, push the lever back in. You may need to tighten up the bolt side of the lever so that when you push the lever down, it will be tight enough. To do this, use a wrench to hold the bolt in place while you wind the lever. After every few turns with the lever, test it by closing it to see if it’s tight enough. If it’s too tight, then unscrew the bolt a few turns, and try the lever again.

, Ride your bike around immediately to see if the seat height works for you. Your legs should rest comfortably on the pedals but shouldn’t bend too much or stretch too much. Make minor adjustments right away since you already have the necessary tools out.

, You might want to tweak the seat height or seat tilt somewhat after you’ve ridden around for a week or so. Oftentimes, a seat will feel uncomfortable if you haven’t ridden your bicycle in a while and you go on a long ride. When your body is more accustomed to riding, you should consider checking your seat height again. Your ideal seat height might be higher than you originally thought. If you raise your seat and all of a sudden it’s easier to ride, then it’s likely your seat was too low., While riding around, your bike seat may move fractionally, especially if you have a lower quality or older bike. You can keep adjusting your seat every time you ride. As you keep doing this, you’ll find the quickest and easiest procedure and it won’t take you much time at all. It will also ensure you have a comfortable ride, especially if you are going for a long or strenuous ride.

,,, Place this ring on a clean paper towel or other surface. It is a good idea to clean and re-grease this with bearing grease.


You can clean the ring by rubbing it with a paper towel in your hands, or with lube/cleaner.
Be sure to re-grease this ring liberally; this is what rotates when you turn your handlebars to turn your bike. Ask your LBS (local bike store) for recommendations for bearing grease.

, You will need to replace them exactly as they were.

, Make sure not to lose the bearing ring on the fork that was resting in the lower cup of the frame.

,, The spindle itself is not very deep; as a result, this tool will easily come out when putting a lot of torque on the wrench to remove the bottom bracket. Be careful not to strip the splines or threads of the bottom bracket.

, These parts are threaded differently, and will require some trial and error to figure out which side the lock ring is on. The lock ring will be threaded normally, and will most likely unscrew somewhat easily (relative to the other side).

,,,,,,,,, You may have a hard time doing this; get someone else to help or get creative about how to hold the chain onto the cog.

Inspect your wheels for bent spokes.,
Check the tightness of your spokes using a spoke wrench.,
Turn your bike upside down so that it’s resting on its seat and handlebars.",How to True Wheels of a Bicycle1,"






;
, At the end of each spoke is a nipple that you can use to tighten or loosen the spoke, thus adjusting how much each individual spoke pulls on the rim. On a perfectly true wheel and rim, all the spokes are equally tight.









You may want to flag particularly tight ones or particularly loose ones. Some people use different colored tapes for this purpose.

, Bike shops use bike stands, but turning the bike upside down allows the wheels to turn freely, so you can eyeball them for wobble.








"
"
Remove the tire and tube for best results.,
Place or tape a ruler, pencil or other straight edge by the forks so that the tool almost touches the rim.,
Spin the wheel.,
Tighten the spokes underneath where the rim hits.,
Spin the wheel after each adjustment.",How to True Wheels of a Bicycle2," The shape of the rim is easier to ascertain without these on the bike. Reattach the rim to the bike for testing.








, This will allow you to see minor fluctuations where the rim is closer to, or further away from, the straight edge.








, The place on the wheel where that tool touches, or almost touches, the straight edge is out of true, and you’ll need to adjust it.








, Make sure to tighten each spoke equally and no more than a half a turn at a time. Also make sure that you tighten the spokes on either side or you’ll throw the wheel out of lateral true.








, Continue adjusting until the rim seems an equal distance away from the straight edge at all times.

Spin the wheel and look to see whether the wheel is perfectly straight as it turns.,
Apply the brakes gradually and watch for the points that hit the brake first.








,
Tighten the spokes on the side opposite where the brake pad hits to pull the rim back to the center.,
Adjust and tighten the spokes by spinning it until there are no spots that touch the brake before any others.

Identify what surface you will be riding on.,
Consider how hard will you be riding.,
Find a pump or air compressor (preferably with a gauge or meter).

,
Find the pressure range for your tire.,
Attach the pump.",How to Use the Correct Tire Pressure While Biking," Are you riding street, park, trails?

For asphalt surfaces, aim for a pressure close to the limit specified on the sidewall of the tire. Anything more can cause a blowout. In addition, excessive pressure will make for an uncomfortable ride. The main advantage of a higher pressure is reduced rolling resistance.
For gravel and trails, aim for a pressure where the tire deforms slightly while turning or going over bumps. This helps absorb bumps and maximizes grip when turning. Try to deform the tire by hand to get an idea of how it will perform.
For sand, go as low as possible without having the tires move on the wheel. This increases the surface area of the contact patch, meaning the tires won't sink in as much.



 

;
, Doing back flips or 10 feet (3.0 m) drops? Keep this in mind and decide whether or not it's a good idea while pumping air into your tires.

,, Certain tires go 50psi (ex. Eastern Curbmonkey OE) others can exceed 100psi (ex. FIT FAF-K Folding or other folding tires)


If you don't have an already semi-pumped tire or it has gone flat, you may want to test the tube for leaks or holes. Fixing holes is generally not worth it.
Also check your rim for nicks, cracks, and flecks of metal, these can puncture the tube.






Put the tire onto the rim, then the tube into the tire. There should be no folds or creases, as these are prone to blowouts and will make the tire misshapen.
Use a tire lever to get the tire completely onto the wheel. Be careful not to damage the inner tube.
Have the valve nozzle sticking out of the hole in the rim. Line up the label of the tire with the valve. This makes it easier to locate the valve but more importantly it looks good.







, Make sure it is on all the way and secured to prevent air from leaking out.

If using a compressor, pay close attention to the pressure gauge. If the compressor doesnt have one, feel the tire to get an idea of how full it is. Do not overfill the tire.
When using a hand pump, keep pumping until the gauge reads the right pressure. Alternatively go by feel.
Check the tire to make sure it's still on the rim.

Remove the wheel.,
Remove the pads.,
Inspect the pads for wear.,
Clean the pads and rotors with rubbing alcohol.,
Sand new pads.,
Reassemble the bike.",How to Stop Bike Brakes from Screeching1," Most mountain bikes and some other bikes use disc brakes, located at the hub. To get full access to its parts, remove the wheel. In most cases, this is as simple as turning the quick release handle outward and lifting the wheel away.


Never activate the brakes while the wheel is removed. The brake pads will move inward and make it very difficult to reinsert the wheel.;
, These parts are usually held in the calipers by a screw or cotter pin, which you can unbend with needle-nose pliers. There may be additional clips holding in the pads.Disc brake designs vary. If you can't figure out how to disassemble yours, track down a user manual.
Try not to touch the braking surface of the pads or rotors with your hands, especially after cleaning them.

, Disc brake pads usually need replacement once they've worn down to 1 mm thick, but you may want to confirm that with the manufacturer instructions.If your pads aren't worn enough to require replacement, try the solutions below instead.

, Grease on the brakes is one of the most common causes of squeaking. Wipe the braking surface of the pads and rotors with rubbing alcohol to dissolve dirt and grease.


You may use warm water and dish soap instead, but this is less effective.

, Brand new pads are usually glossy and hard. These tend to squeak until you've worn them in. To speed up this process, lightly scuff the surface of the pad with sandpaper.

, Place the pads back in the disc brakes. Fasten the wheel back onto the bike. Double check that all bolts are tight, as loose attachments are another cause of squeaking and poor braking.


Wet brake pads may screech. Let the alcohol evaporate before reassembly.

Wipe the rim with a dry cloth.,
Clean off grime.,
Dry the rims.,
Check the brake pads for damage.,
Sand the brake pads or rims.,
Toe in the brake pads.",How to Stop Bike Brakes from Screeching2," V-brakes or center pull brakes press directly on the rim to stop the bike. Dirt or grease on the rims can interfere with the brake friction and cause squealing. Wipe off obvious dirt with a clean cloth.

, Rubbing alcohol, acetone, or another oil-free solvent are ideal for removing grease. Wet a cloth in one of these substances, then scrub away grease on the rims.


Warm soapy water isn't ideal, but usually does the trick.

, A wet surface has less friction, so dry it with a clean cloth or paper towel. Handle the wheel by the spokes, not the rims, to avoid transferring oil from your hands. (This is a good tip to follow in daily use as well.)

, Occasionally, a sharp object or a fragment of metal embeds itself in a rim brake pad. Inspect the pads carefully and pick out any foreign objects with an awl or other sharp tool.


If the brake pads are worn thin, you may need to replace them. Typically, there should be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of rubber between the clamp and the tire when the caliper is engaged to brake the bike. You can use a brake pad gauge to measure this precisely.

, New brake pads have a hard surface that needs to be worn in. This will happen naturally over time, but you can shortcut it with a light sanding. If your rims are especially smooth and shiny, scuff them up a little as well.

, You'll have less noise and better braking ability if the pads are angled inward. Looking down from above the wheel, the front of the brake pads should be slightly closer to the rim. Most rim brakes allow you to adjust the angle by tightening or loosening nuts, and/or rotating washers.Never bend the arms of the brake pads to adjust the angle. This will weaken the metal.If your bike doesn't allow for this adjustment, consider replacing the brakes.

Test the wheel.,
Check the cables.,
Make sure the caliper moves when the cable pulls on it.",How to Stop Bike Brakes from Screeching3," Spin the wheel. If it wobbles or fails to spin freely, you may need to true the wheel. This can be difficult if you haven't done it before, but a bike shop will usually true your wheels for cheap.

, Squeeze the brake handles and make sure the cable moves. If it does not, your cable may be stuck in the cable housing, or the clamp in the handle may be loose.

, If you have caliper brakes, have a friend operate the brakes while you watch the caliper. If the brake cable moves but the end of the caliper does not, the cable may be broken inside the cable housing. The whole cable assembly will have to be replaced.

Reconnect the chains using the chain tool.,
Loosen the chain, if necessary.,
Apply a high-quality lubricant to the chain.This will increase the chain's lifespan and flexibility.",How to Shorten a Bike Chain," Count out 12 links, and measure them from the first pin to last pin. The distance between those pins should be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters). If the distance is more than 12 1/8 inches (30.80 centimeters), then you need to replace the chain. This is because pins are wearing out, lengthening the chain.If the distance between the 12 links is correct, and you have an older bike, consider loosening the back wheel and pulling it back. This may take up enough of the chain's slack to fix the problem.;
, This tool pushes the pins out of your chain to allow link removal. If you know the make and model of your bike chain, you may prefer to track down a specialized tool for that specific chain.


Some chains, notably most Shimano and Campagnolo models, also require a special reassembly pin.You cannot put the chain back together without this pin, so make sure you have the right part before you get started.

, If you do not have a bike stand, lean it against something sturdy, preferably upside down. This will make it easier to remove the chain.

, Use a high-quality, biodegradable chain cleaner to dissolve any dirt or grease. This will make it easier to handle the chain and find the master link., Your chain may or may not have a master link. The master link is easy to spot, because it is usually slightly lighter/darker than the other links on the chain. It may also have protruding pins inserted into a special outer plate. This plate typically has an oversize, oval hole around one or both pins.

, This will make it easier to access. The master link is easy to spot, because it is usually slightly lighter/darker than the other links on the chain. It may also have protruding pins inserted into a special outer plate. This plate typically has an oversize, oval hole around one or both #*If your chain does not have a master link, you'll use a chain tool to break the chain. The steps to do so are described in Part 2: Shortening the Chain.

, There are many designs of master links. Some swivel to allow the pin to slide out, while others open up when flexed. Some master links are also disposable, and can only be removed by bending them apart with needle-nose pliers or a specialized tool.

, It's better to take off too few links at first than to take off too many. It'll be easier to take off an extra link or two than to add several links back on., Start at the end of the chain not attached to the master link. Hold that link in place with a vise, or use the clamping mechanism on your chain tool if present.


If your chain does not use a master link, start with any link on the chain.

, Line up the punch on the tool over the link's pin. Slowly turn the handle on the chain tool clockwise, and stop when the pin is clear of the outer plate, but still attached to the link. Do not push the pin completely out of the link, or it will be very difficult to reassemble the chain. If you did accidentally push the pin all the way out:Slide the pin through the center of the link.
Use the chain tool to remove the upper part of the joining link.
Use the chain tool to slide the pin back through the link, until the top of the pin is flush with the center part of the link.
Replace the top part of the link, then use the chain tool push the pin back up.
Adjust the adjacent pin, as necessary.

, Move on to the other pin in the same link. Push this out far enough that you can lift away one of the outer plates, followed by the central piece attaching it to the next link.

, Only remove the minimum number of links to make your chain work, generally less than five. The more you shorten the chain, the more stress you'll put on the links.


As before, leave the pins partially attached and set aside all components.
Consider saving the chain links you are removing for future repairs., You may need to use some pliers or a screwdriver in order to do this. Push the two links together until you feel the pins click into place in the inner link.


If your chain has a disposable master link or special pin, you'll need a replacement part to reattach the chain. Most of these special pins come in two parts that enter from opposite sides, but it's best to look for model-specific instructions.

, Place the two links back into the chain tool's outer slot. Make sure that the pins are facing towards the chain tool's pin. Turn the handle counterclockwise. As you turn, the chain tool's pin will start pushing the pins back through the link. Keep going until you can see a small portion of the link from the other side. The chain pin should be sticking out the same amount on both sides of the link.If you have quick-release link, you may need a pair of pliers in order to replace it., Sometimes, the chain links end up too stiff after you re-connect them. Start by placing the link into the inner slot of the chain tool. Tighten the chain tool's pin until it touches the chain's pin. Give the tool's handle a quarter of a turn, remove the chain, and test it. If it is too tight, repeat the process., It will also improve shifting performance, and reduce wear on derailleur assemblies and drivetrain cogs."

, The non-pin plate will go on the outside of the master link assembly.

, First make sure the closed end of the spring clip will be at the head of chain travel, and the open end of the clip will trail the head end. Place the spring clip over the grooves in the pins, then use a flat head screwdriver to push the clip into place. You will hear a click when it snaps into place

",How to Lube a Bicycle Chain," The floor is likely to get a little dirty, so thoroughly cover the floor with newspaper. Don't do this on carpet or other floors that should be protected, unless you've lined the floor with plastic.






;
, Place it in the middle of the newspaper-covered area.








,, This works best if you hold the blade of the screwdriver sideways against the outer portions of the cog and gently turn the cranks. Try to avoid allowing the scraped-off dried mud and dirt to land on the chain.








, Dampen it. Provided that you are working in a well-ventilated area, you might like to add a degreasing cleaner, such as lighter fuel or a citrus degreaser. (See ""Tips"", however.)








, Hold on tightly. Turn the cranks a couple of times while holding the rag around the chain firmly. This works best if you hold the upper portion of the chain, the one that's closest to the saddle (seat). You will notice that the chain becomes much cleaner.








,









Mark one link with a magic marker, sticker or a piece of tape, so that you know where you started.
Starting with the marked link, apply one drop of chain lube to each link. It's best to apply a little drop to each gap where two links overlap. Don't use too much or it will be wasted because you'll wipe off the excess lube anyway!

, When you've lubed all the links, turn the cranks again for half a minute or so to make sure that the lube settles properly into the inside of the link.

, Use a spray dispensing liquid or powder lock lubricant. Use a liberal amount of lubricant by working the spray at all angles in the key way of the lock.

, Lock removal tools are readily available at hardware and automobile parts stores. If a tool is not available, use a homemade substitute.


Choose a tool that is narrow enough to slip into the lock key way, which is the straight opening in the lock that extends down from the key opening itself. The tool must have 1 or more hooks on the end to be inserted into the lock.






Choose a tool that has a pointed hook or hooks. The hooks must extend up towards the key so that they can engage the key teeth. The hooks also should be angled back toward the outer lock opening so they can be used to pull the key back without slipping off of the key teeth.







, Gently insert this tool into the lock key way. Turn the hook or hooks sideways while inserting the tool so that they do not catch on the teeth of the key during insertion. Gently jiggle the tool as needed to allow complete insertion of the tool.

, Turn the tool so that the hook or hooks are facing towards the key. Slowly and gently pull the tool back, jiggling the tool if necessary, to engage one or more of the teeth of the key.

, If the key does not begin to come out with the tool, the hook or hooks did not catch the teeth. Should this occur, reinsert the key removal tool and make a second attempt to engage the tool.

Choose a wet lube if you ride in the rain.,
Clean and dry the chain before lubricating it.,
Lube the top of the chain.,
Lube the bottom of the chain.,
Wipe away excess lubricant.",How to Lubricate a Bike1," If you live in a rainy environment or frequently ride on wet, muddy trails, go for a wet chain lube. It's thicker, so heavy downpours and mud won't wash it away. If you live in a drier climate, choose a thinner chain lube marked for dry conditions.You can find wet and dry bicycle lubricants online or at a bike shop. Make sure to use only lubricants marked for bicycles.
If you frequently use your bike in both wet and dry conditions, buy one of each lube.;
, It’s best to thoroughly clean your bike’s chain before you lubricate it.Spray a clean rag with a bicycle degreaser or WD-40. With the bike in a work stand or propped up, grasp the chain with the soaked rag and use your hand to pedal the chain through the rag.Pedal the chain through the rag until each of the chain’s links have passed through the cleaning rag two or three times. Repeat the technique with another clean rag to wipe away excess residue and dry the chain.
Note that while some manufacturers advise using WD-40 as a cleaning solution, it’s not a proper lubricant on its own.

, Touch the lubricant container’s straw nozzle to one side (either the inside of the chain closest to the frame or the outside) of the top of the bike chain. Spin the pedals forward to move each of the chain’s links past the lubricating nozzle. Once you’ve spun the chain in two complete rotations, repeat the process on the other side of the chain’s top.Try not to apply too much lube as you pedal the chain. A little goes a long way, so just apply a thin stream. Wiping away excess will help make sure you cover the nooks and crannies.

, Use a similar procedure to lube both sides of the chain’s bottom. Touch the nozzle to the inner and outer sides of the chain, and rotate the chain twice for each side. Pedal backward when you lube the bottom of the chain, instead of pedaling forward as you did with the top side., You’ll need to get rid of excess lubricant after you’ve lubed the inner and outer edges of the chain’s top and bottom. Grasp the chain with a clean, dry rag and pedal forward to move the chain through the rag. Continue for two or three rotations, or until you’ve wiped away all the excess surface lube.Wiping away the excess surface lube will help reduce dirt and debris from caking up your chain.

Use a second clean rag to thoroughly dry the assemblies before lubricating them., Touch the lubricant container’s straw nozzle to the center of the derailleur pulley wheel. Pedal backwards a few revolutions to spin and thinly lubricate the wheel. Repeat the sequence for each of your bike’s pulleys.Remember to use a lube marked for bicycles. Go with a product marked for wet or dry weather, depending on your local conditions., There are several points at which your derailleur assembly and brakes pivot, or move in and out of place as you shift gears or brake. Once you’ve located the derailleur assemblies and lubed the pulley wheels, apply the brakes and shift gears to find your pivot points. Use the straw nozzle to apply a drop of lubricant to each pivot point, lever, and any other metal-on-metal joint.Be sure to avoid getting lube on your brake pads.

, Since they’re contained in a nylon-lined housing, brake and shift cables don’t usually require lubrication.However, if yours bind, click the shifter into the highest gear without pedaling and use the brake quick release to create enough slack to loosen the housing and slide out the cables. You can then apply a few drops of lube to the cables, wipe off excess, then slide them back into the housing., After lubing your derailleur assembly, pivot points, and cables, be sure to wipe away all excess surface lubricant.

If you ride your bike daily, you should clean it at least once or twice a month, or as soon as you hear any squeaking., After a long ride in the rain, it’s best to give your bike chain some attention. Clean and dry it thoroughly as soon as you get home. After drying it off, lubricate it, then wipe away excess lube., Aside from the chain, your bike’s other components will likely need cleaning and lubrication every few months. If you live in a wet climate or frequently ride in the rain, you should lube the derailleur assemblies and other moving parts more often.Always inspect and lubricate your bike when you first hear squeaking or other indicators of abrasion.

, If you notice your bike is grimy whenever you perform maintenance, you should look into switching lubes. Instead of an automotive lubricant or thick grease, make sure you’re using a lubricant marked for bicycles, which is thinner in consistency.If your notice lots of grime, you might also need to wipe off excess lubricant more thoroughly.

Find a trustworthy mechanic before you actually need one so that you won't be pressed into locating one in a hurry if your car suddenly breaks down.,
Trust your instinct.,
Prevent rip-offs by contacting the Better Business Bureau, AAA (American Automobile Association) and the Consumer Affairs Office in your city or state.,
Look for shops with an ASE symbol on the sign, which indicates the shop met the criteria for Automotive Service Excellence.,
Be familiar with your vehicle.,
Ask if the shop has experience dealing with your type of car.,
Make a checklist of what work your vehicle needs.,
Get an itemized written estimate in advance and be sure the mechanic contacts you before doing any work that exceeds the original estimate.,
Request a detailed invoice that includes costs of labor and parts.",How to Prevent Auto Repair Rip offs," Ask friends and family for recommendations, then take your car to the shop for something simple such as an oil change.;
, If you have a feeling or intuition that the mechanic is less than trustworthy, take your vehicle elsewhere. Take your car to a second mechanic for another opinion if the estimate sounds high, or if something just doesn't seems right. If your car isn't running, call a tow truck. You aren't obligated to stay with a mechanic just because he looked at your car and gave you an estimate.

, Ask if there have been any complaints about the mechanic, and if so, how the problems were resolved.

, The symbol should be not only on the sign, but on a certificate on the wall and usually on the mechanic's uniform. Shops approved by AAA (American Automobile Association) are also a good bet. AAA approval means that the work must be guaranteed for 6,000 miles (9,700 km) or six months.

, Read your vehicle's manual and stay current with recommendations for oil changes and other maintenance schedules. Being familiar with your vehicle will help you prevent auto repair rip-offs.

, For example, if you have a foreign car, be sure the mechanic has the experience and equipment to deal with your vehicle.

, If you aren't sure, outline the problems very clearly and find out exactly how the mechanic plans to deal with each problem. Be specific and never give a mechanic free reign to do whatever your car needs without discussing it with you first.

, Read estimate carefully and ask questions if something seems odd or isn't clear. Ask if the parts and work are guaranteed.

, Check the bill carefully and ask for clarification on any discrepancies. Pay by credit card or check so that you have a record of payment and so you can stop payment if you think you've been ripped off.

Inspect your wheel wells and bumpers.,
Look for signs of rust where body components meet.,
Inspect the bottom of your vehicle regularly.,
Don’t allow water to sit in or on the vehicle.",How to Prevent Rust on Your Car1," Your wheel wells are a common trouble spot for rust developing in a vehicle. Because they tend to be dirty and difficult to see clearly, people often neglect to inspect them. Most tire manufacturers recommend that you rotate your tires every 6,000 miles (10,000 km), so as you remove the wheel from your vehicle to rotate it to another wheel well, use a flashlight to check in the well for rust. Check the areas your bumpers attach to the vehicle each time you rotate your tires as well.If there is too much dirt or mud in the wheel well to inspect for rust, use a hose to spray the area out, then check again.
Use rotating your tires as a reminder to check your bumpers for rust as well. Older vehicles with metal bumpers sometimes rust faster than the body of the vehicle.;
, Your vehicle is most likely to rust where two pieces of metal meet, particularly if there is the potential for them to rub. Rubbing will wear away the protection provided by the paint, allowing rust to form. Walk around your vehicle and inspect the areas where components meet such as in the door frame, where the hood meets the fenders, and around the trunk.Open the doors, hood and trunk while you inspect your vehicle for rust.
Look for signs that the paint is bubbling, as rust may be developing beneath bubbled up paint.

, The underside of your car or truck often takes the most punishment, and is therefore more likely to rust. If you live in an area that snows in the winter, salt and other chemicals used to treat snow and ice on the roads may increase the likelihood of rust developing beneath your car. Check beneath your car during oil changes or as you rotate your tires for signs of rust developing.Look beneath your vehicle for rust while changing your oil.

Never climb under your vehicle without using jack stands.


, Your vehicle is designed to withstand most things regular weather can throw at it. Paint, clear coats and plastic trim pieces are all intended to protect the metal on your vehicle from rusting, but over time these forms of protection can become compromised. If you notice an area of your car or truck that tends to hold water, such as a truck bed or leaky trunk, make sure to drain it or dry the water out of it.If your trunk leaks and gathers water, there should be drains that allow the water to pour out. If the water does not drain, locate the drain holes by consulting your service manual and remove whatever is blocking them from allowing the water to drain.

Wash your vehicle regularly.,
Wash the undercarriage of the vehicle.,
Use baking soda to neutralize road salt.,
Rinse the vehicle thoroughly.,
Wax your vehicle at least twice a year.",How to Prevent Rust on Your Car2," Although dirt does not directly cause rust, dirt and sediment can wear through your paint over time, especially when anyone touches the paint. Other things that can reduce your vehicle’s protection against rust include bird droppings and gasoline that spills when filling the vehicle. Over time, these things wear through wax, clear coat and paint, leaving the metal susceptible to rusting.Wash your vehicle every few weeks so sand and dirt can’t be rubbed through the paint.
Bird droppings and gasoline can eat through the paint. Consider washing your vehicle if either comes into contact with the paint.

, If you live in an area that snows in the winter, salt and chemical deposits on the underside of your vehicle can compromise its ability to protect against rust. Wash the underside of your vehicle regularly to prevent these materials from sitting on your vehicle for long.Many automatic car washes offer undercarriage cleaning.
You may also jack up your car and spray the underside using a hose.

, If you often have to deal with road salt, you may choose to add a small amount of baking soda to the soap and water you wash the undercarriage and wheel wells of your vehicle with. A tablespoon of baking soda will neutralize the acidic effect of the salt and other ice melting chemicals used on the roads.Make sure to use baking soda in conjunction with an automotive soap.
One tablespoon of baking soda is sufficient to clean the undercarriage of most vehicles.

, Leaving dried soap on your vehicle can also reduce the lifespan of the paint. Make sure you rinse all of the soap off of your car or truck each time you wash it. Never wash your vehicle in direct sunlight, as it may cause the soap to dry to the paint much faster.You may choose to apply soap to your vehicle in sections, such as the hood, then rinse it completely before moving on to the next portion of the vehicle.
Dried soap will also dull the appearance of the paint on your vehicle.

, Wax does more than provide your vehicle with a healthy shine, it also protects the paint from fading and damage. Applying a coat of wax to your vehicle twice a year will provide the paint with an extra layer of protection and help reduce the chances of rust forming.Wax repels water and creates another layer of protection for the paint.
Wax will also protect your paint from fading in direct sunlight.

Scrape rust off with a razor blade or fine grit sandpaper.,
Apply rust arrestor to prevent the further spread of rust.,
Allow the rust arrestor to dry completely.,
Apply primer over the dried rust arrestor.,
Locate the correct color of automotive paint.,
Apply touch up paint over the primer.",How to Prevent Rust on Your Car3," If you locate a rust spot on your vehicle, taking action to prevent it from spreading is your best course of action. Start by scraping the rust off using a razor blade or fine grit sandpaper. Be careful not to damage the paint surrounding the rust spot.Only remove the rust, try to avoid scraping off the paint surrounding it.
If the paint is flaking off, it means it is no longer bonded to the metal in that area and will likely fall off anyway. If it is flaking off in a large area, you may need to have that portion of the vehicle repainted completely.

, Once you have scraped off the rust, apply an over the counter rust arrestor to the area. This will prevent new rust from forming in the area. Most rust arrestors come with an application brush; dip the brush in the rust arrestor and then apply a thin coat to the area that was previously rusty.If your rust arrestor does not come with an application brush, use a Q-Tip or small rag to apply it to the metal. Do not spray it on.
You can purchase rust arrestor at most auto parts stores.

, Depending on the type of rust arrestor you choose and the environment, it may take up to a few hours for the rust arrestor to dry completely. Read the instructions on the bottle to ensure you allow enough time for it to completely cure before moving on to the next step.It may take longer for the rust arrestor to dry in cooler or more humid environments.
Rust arrestor will dry faster in direct sunlight.

, Use a small applicator brush to apply automotive primer to the area that used to be rusty, over the dried rust arrestor. The coat of primer should be thin but complete, so you can’t see any metal through it. Make sure not to over apply the primer so it begins to drip. Use a paper towel or rag to dab up any excess primer before it has the opportunity to drip.
Allow the primer to dry completely before adding automotive paint.

, You can find the correct shade of touch up paint in a number of ways. Many auto manufacturers can provide you with a bottle of touch up paint based on the VIN number for your car. You may also be able to find the paint code located near the VIN number on the placard inside the driver’s door of many vehicles. Use that paint code to purchase a bottle of automotive touch up paint with a matching code. Be careful to choose paint that is an exact match for the existing paint on your car, otherwise the spot will stand out in direct sunlight.
You can purchase automotive touch up paint from most auto parts stores and some dealerships.

, Dip the applicator brush into the touch up paint, then dab it onto the dried primer. Do not use long strokes or lines may appear in the paint. Dab the paint into the middle of the spot and allow it to spread evenly. Be careful not to apply too much paint so it drips.
If the area is larger than a dime, you may also want to wet sand it.

Always fix problems as they arise.",How to Perform a Basic Tune up for Your Car," One of the most simple ways you can extend the life or your automobile without paying for costly tune-ups is to check your oil level regularly and add more oil, if it's low. It only takes a minute or two to check the level, and the dipstick included in your engine block makes the job a snap for even the novice.


Find the cap on your engine, usually labeled ""Oil"" and find the dipstick that should be close by on the engine block. Do this when the engine's had a chance to cool down, or do it first thing in the morning to get the most accurate reading. Remove the dipstick and wipe off the oil with a paper towel or rag.






Examine the rag. Is the oil especially black? Do you notice any sediment, or chunky-looking oil? If so, you're probably in need of an oil change. Put the dipstick back and remove it once more to check the level. Notches on the dipstick should tell you how full the compartment should be.If you're low, remove the cap and add a small amount of a high-grade motor oil appropriate for your type of engine. Ask at the auto parts store if you're unsure about what kind of oil to use. Use a funnel to avoid spillage, and recheck the level once you've topped it off.





;
, Nothing's worse than a busted tire at the wrong moment, when you're running late to work in the rain. No thanks. Regularly inspecting tires and rotating them can help to avoid this irritation. Check both the air pressure in your tires, and check the tread for wear and replace the tires if you need to.You can use a pressure gauge at most gas stations, or you can buy one for a few dollars at an auto parts store and keep it in your glove box for regular checks. Open the driver's side door and look at the sticker on the doorjamb — this will tell you the recommended pressure for your tires. There is also a number printed on your tires, but this is the maximum PSI for your tires, which is generally more PSI than you want or need. Don't over-inflate. Keeping your tires inflated to the proper specifications improves gas mileage and handling.







, Find the windshield washer fluid compartment, transmission fluid, brake fluid, as well as the anti-freeze compartment to make sure they're both full and clean, and add more fluid if necessary. This isn't something you'll need to check every week, but doing it semi-regularly will ensure that your car is in good working order.



The transmission fluid dipstick should be easily identified in your owner's manual. Sometimes it is the only other dipstick in an automatic transmission vehicle, but some vehicles have dipsticks for power steering and coolant as well. . Remove it, wipe it off, and read the level. It should be mostly clear, with a kind of red color to it. You'll only need to change transmission fluid every 100,000 miles (160,000 km) or so. Some manufacturers recommend 60,000 or even 30,000 for transmission fluid replacement — always go with the manufacturers recommendation.







The brake fluid is housed in a white plastic reservoir in the engine compartment, labeled ""brake fluid."" This should only ever decrease slightly, unless you've got a leak in your line somewhere, which means you need to take it into be serviced immediately, or check the lines yourself.







Radiator fluid or coolant needs to be checked when the engine is stone cold. When the engine heats, even a little, scalding radiator fluid will literally shoot out of the cap when you remove it. Be extremely careful. If you start noticing a strange, sickly-sweet smell that comes through your air-conditioner ducts as you're driving, you might have a coolant leak, causing glycol to drip onto the engine compartment and burn. If your levels are low, this could be the cause.







Power steering fluid and windshield washer fluid are both housed in the engine compartment in plastic reservoirs, though some are built into the pump itself as well. Power-steering fluid will often have a mark for a cold engine and a hot engine, so look at the right level to check, adding more if necessary. Wiper-fluid isn't essential to the car's life, but you can extend the life of your wipers by making sure it's full.







, Inspect your car's battery for corrosion and other signs of wear. The battery terminals can become caked with fluid from the battery's components, which can gum up the contact points and cause trouble when you're trying to start it up. If you're noticing the car doesn't start up as crisply as it used to, inspect these contact points.



Clean them, if necessary, with baking soda and an old toothbrush. You can also use a tiny amount of soda pop to cut through the corrosion and clean them up. Loosen the bolts that secure them, if necessary, and clear out any build-up.







, Periodically, when you're driving around and the coast is clear, pump your brakes hard at a slow speed to get a feel for how they react. Do they initiate right away? Does the ABS engage at the proper moment? Do you notice any grinding, squeaking, or unevenness in the action? Any abnormality could be a sign of worn-out brake pads, which is a good indication that you've got some tune-ups to make.

, It's a good idea to regularly perform light checks to make sure all your lights are functioning properly and that nothing is burned out. Have a helper turn on the turn signals and pump the brakes while parked to check for burn-outs or misalignments.


To check the brights, you can park aimed at a wall and flash them. They'll sometimes need to be aligned to make sure they're illuminating the right amount of road and giving you the vision necessary for safe night driving.







, To keep your engine functioning to its maximum potential, you need to drain the old oil completely and fill with fresh oil appropriate to the kind of engine in your car. You'll also want to change the oil filter, which usually has a life of about 15,000 miles (24,000 km). While you're doing an oil change, though, is usually a good opportunity to change the filter, which increases the life of your vehicle.Changing the oil is an intermediate-level project. While there's nothing difficult about the task itself, you've got to have the space and materials necessary (you'll need fresh oil, an oil pan, and jack-stands or ramps). It's relatively cheap and quick to take it into the shop to have it done, especially if you live in the city and don't have a good space to tune up your car yourself.






The service interval of 3,000 miles (5,000 km) can vary from vehicle to vehicle. Always go with the manufacturers recommendation; however, it does not hurt the vehicle in any way to change oil more often.

, To even out the wear on your tires and get more life out of them, it's helpful to rotate them periodically, using the correct crossing pattern. Depending on the kind of treat on your tires, you might need to switch the side, as well as the positioning. You'll need several jack stands if you want to rotate your tires yourself, or you can take it in and have them rotated on a hydraulic lift at the shop quickly and affordably., If you notice the blade of your wipers coming loose, cracking, or you notice gaps in the coverage when they're operating, remove the old windshield wipers and replace them with new ones. At the auto parts store, you can usually consult the manual in the aisle to find out the size you need for your car, or you can bring in the old ones for a quick replacement.

, The air filter unit should be on top of the engine, under a bulky, rounded cover, usually made of metal or plastic. Removing the air filter and cleaning it thoroughly (even just gently blowing some compressed air through it and wiping it off) can help extend the life of your engine considerably. Keep in mind that some air filter materials are very soft and fragile. A hard blast of compressed air can blow a hole through some air filters and prevent them from filtering any air at all.


If your air filter is not on top of the engine, it may be located in an air box with duct work that travels from the front of the vehicle to the box then to the throttle body. Some air cleaners are not even noticeable from under the hood and must be serviced from under the car.

, Sometimes called the ""serpentine belt,"" a long rubber belt snakes through the alternator, power-steering pump, and other engine components, and a power-steering belt operates in a similar fashion. The alignment and installation of the belts will vary widely, depending on your engine, but if you notice a high-pitched squeaking noise when you start up or when you turn, inspect the belts for wear and replace them. The belt only costs a few dollars, and a diagram of the installation is generally included in the engine compartment.

, The spark plugs of the car should also be checked and replaced when needed. These spark plugs are vital in the vehicle’s fuel combustion mechanism so it is important to maintain these in good working condition. Any failure of the spark plugs might cause the engine to stall so you should prevent this from happening by regular replacement.

, Simply put, the more cold starts you put your car through on a daily basis, the harder it is on the engine. If you want to extend the life of your car as much as possible, only use your car when absolutely necessary and avoid lots of stops and starts.


Avoid short trips that you might consolidate into longer ones. Instead of running to one store in the morning when you need dog food and heading to the grocery store later in the day when you need to get stuff for dinner, consolidate both trips and plan out your driving more effectively.
If you're going to be driving less for an extended period of time, consider wintering your car somewhere safe and getting around some other way.

, Putting strain on the transmission by going from a dead start to fast-as-possible is a good way to ruin your engine in the long run. Slow down. Even if you're in a hurry, learn to accelerate smoothly and gently, working up to your intended speed. Even if you're driving an automatic transmission, pretend you're shifting gears at a relaxed pace to learn to accelerate properly.

, Manual transmissions can be shifted to a lower gear and, thereby, use the engine to slow the car, while drivers of cars with automatic transmissions need to be more careful about decelerating strongly at the last moment. Going straight from accelerating to braking puts a lot of wear on your brake pads, regardless of the kind of transmission you have, so it's important to anticipate your stops and coast into them.


Never accelerate toward red lights. Take your foot off the gas and maintain your speed in preparation for a stop.

, Changing out the clutch is one of the most difficult jobs, and one of the most expensive things to pay for. Hard shifts in which you accidentally grind the gears, or revving the RPMs too much will put strain on the transmission, which can be costly to repair or replace. Practice shifting smoothly, especially in the low gears.

, Use the octane specified in your owner's manual and usually written on the inside of the fuel door. Avoid fueling at gas stations that have just been delivered a load of gas. If you see a filling station receiving a tanker load of gas, go elsewhere. When the new gas is dumped into the tank, sediment and water on the bottom of the tank tends to get distributed throughout the tank. Even though there are filters at the pump and in your car, these do not catch everything and will clog over time. It is best to avoid fueling at these times. If there are not nearby stations, take a break, go to the bathroom, walk around and wait for 15 or 20 minutes for the gas to settle in the underground tank. It is also best to pump your gas slowly, as vapors escape faster when the pump runs full speed.

, When an issue comes up, there's no time like the present to get out in the driveway and start tuning things up. Driving around with a squeaky alternator belt for weeks at a time is both bad form for your engine and for your neighbors' sanity.

Check the emissions standards and procedures in your state.,
Find your particular vehicle group.,
Learn the common causes of emission issues.",How to Pass Emissions1," Many states require periodic emissions tests to be performed to ensure that your car is running as clean as possible and not contributing to excessive air pollution. There are a lot of complicated numbers associated with the process that are probably not of interest to the average driver and vehicle owner, but you can research the Environmental Protection Agency standards for all vehicles here.


You don't need to know the standards to have your vehicle tested. All you need to do is find a testing location in your area and schedule an appointment. They'll tell you if your vehicle is up to the standards, and help you get it to code if it isn't.
You can help avoid problems by keeping up on the maintenance of your engine fluids and filters. You should have your exhaust system checked periodically for any issues that may cause a future failure. If your check engine light comes on, have it serviced quickly to prevent further problems.;
, Emissions testing is different for different types of vehicles, and is required for a vehicle to be street-legal in some states, while in others there's no requirement at all. Motorcycles are required to be tested in some areas, but not in others. Check with your local bureau of motor vehicles to make sure your vehicle needs to be tested. The most common exclusions are:


Vehicles manufactured pre-1975
Diesel vehicles manufactured pre-1997
Electric vehicles and hybrids
Trailers, Failing the emission test is likely the result of some common performance issues in your vehicle. Learning to anticipate and correct these issues can help you pass the emissions test, once you've got it scheduled. The most common system failures are:



Out-of-spec fuel metering: This could be the result of the CPU, if your vehicle has one, or the fuel injection and carburetor unit.

Worn-out spark plugs: These can cause hydrocarbons to spike during the examination. Just basic maintenance on the engine can sometimes cause emissions to spike.

Vacuum leaks: These can occur because the MAP sensor is dysfunctional, or the hoses are faulty. Your MAF sensor may also have issues with a vacuum leak and turn on the check engine light.

Air-injection and EVAP malfunction: If the air-injection system in the engine malfunctions, it won't be able to control the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions properly.The EVAP system may be venting fuel vapors into the engine when it is not supposed to, causing high hydrocarbons.

"
"
Schedule a vehicle inspection.,
Make sure the check engine light is off before your appointment.,
Warm up your vehicle before testing.,
Keep your tires inflated properly.,
Pick a dry day for the test.",How to Pass Emissions2," Get your car checked out by an emissions technician in your area to catch anything that you might have missed or overlooked. Typically, in states that require vehicles be emission-tested, these are as common as oil-change stations and Jiffy-Lubes. Look one up in your area and schedule a test.


Just because your car is running fine and shows no signs of ""problems"" doesn't mean that it'll pass emissions. Many vehicles can continue operating well even though they've dipped under the local government regulations. This can happen when you don't keep up with scheduled maintenance.

, If your check engine light is on, you will fail the emissions test automatically. If you don't know what the problem is, an emissions repair shop can run a diagnostics test and fix the problem for you.


The car must be tested as-is, which means that even if the technician spots an issue that will obviously result in a failure of the test, the vehicle must be failed. If you know, for example, that you've got a leaky vacuum hose, or that your check engine light is on, you need to have those issues corrected at the shop or fix them yourself, before having the test performed.

, Drive your vehicle for at least 20 minutes before arriving at the emissions testing station. This will give your vehicle enough time to reach optimal temperatures for your coolant and oils as well as optimal temperature for your catalytic converter, ensuring that you'll get an accurate reading.


If you cannot drive your vehicle before the test then just run your engine in park or neutral at 1500 to 2000 RPM’s for at least five minutes to ensure your engine and exhaust are warmed up. In colder weather this may take a few minutes longer.

, Proper tire pressure will put less strain on your car engine, which will improve your chances of passing the test. Equally-distributing the weight of the vehicle as it is driven during the test by the inspector will result in a higher likelihood that you'll pass. It's a good idea to fill up the tires to the proper specs before you take it in.

, Because a dynamometer will be involved in the test, driving on slippery roads in which you might lose some traction can affect the efficiency of your engine, possibly enough to skew the test. To give yourself the best possibility of passing with flying colors, schedule the test for a sunny day with nice weather and good driving conditions."
"
Change your engine oil regularly.,
Replace your filters regularly.,
Use fuel additives if they're appropriate for your vehicle.,
Adjust your carburetor for the proper air-fuel mixture.",How to Pass Emissions3," If you haven't changed your oil in over 5,000 miles (8,000 km), this is almost a necessity. If you have changed your oil in the past 5,000 miles (8,000 km), it may still be a good idea to get it changed again before having your car tested. Schedule an oil change, or do it yourself. Dirty oils can cause the emission levels to be higher than normal.

, Fuel and air filters need to be changed periodically to keep your engine as efficient as possible, and your emissions as low-impact as possible. Consult your owner's manual for specific guidelines regarding mileage, and keep a steady schedule of replacements. Check your air filter and, if it is dirty, change it before your emission test, since a dirty air filter can cause high hydrocarbons.

, Check your owner's manual to determine whether or not using Premium fuel is appropriate for your model. Other additives, like Clean Sky Clean Air can be added during refueling to purge carbon deposits from the engine during normal operations. Be aware that some additives could alter your emissions test and could be a cause of a failure. Be sure to tell your mechanic what additives you are using if you have failed. The additive could have been the cause.

, Running too rich can have a long-term affect on your engine's ability to process hydrocarbons and CO emissions. It's a good idea to periodically check how lean or rich your engine is running to make sure you're within the proper specifications and keep your engine functioning properly.

Approach it from under the hood.",How to Open the Hood of a Vehicle1," If the cable between the latch and hood is sticky or stretched, it may not disengage the latch properly. Most cars are designed to disengage the cable when you press down on the front of the hood. Do this while your assistant pulls the interior latch. If it works, the hood will shift and raise slightly, and can then be opened with the exterior latch., Locate the cable under the dashboard, near the interior release latch. Tug gently on this cable and see what happens:


If the hood opens, your cable may have slipped or stretched. Try to adjust it at the front end, or replace it if you see any damage. (Less commonly, your interior release latch could be broken.)
If you feel no tension at all, the cable is no longer attached to the front latch. Continue to the next step. Once you open the hood, check to see whether you can slip it back on, or whether the cable has snapped and needs replacement.


, At this point, you need a way to reach the latch or cable from another angle. If you're lucky, you can see the latch through the front grille. Investigate with a flashlight and a small mirror until you find a hook-shaped object.Alternatively, the latch may be accessible from the driver's side fender well. In many cars, such as Hondas, the latch cables are run through the inner driver's side fender well. Remove the inner fender well clips and reach in. Pull the cable to pop the hood open. This will only work if the cable itself is still attached to the hood latch.

, Once you find the latch, reach in with a long, thin screwdriver. If the gaps in the grille are small, use a wire coat hanger instead. Hook this over the latch and tug.You can remove the grille to get more direct access. Even replacing a non-removable grille might be cheaper than taking the car to a mechanic, depending on your model.

, If you can't operate the latch from the front, your last chance is to reach under the hood and attempt to tug the cable with a pair of pliers, or reach all the way to the latch. This will be much easier if you jack the car and refer to the owner's manual.


Warning: if the engine was on recently, let the car cool off before reaching under the hood.
If this doesn't work, take the car to a mechanic. Removing the front bumper yourself may end up more expensive than paying for a repair.

Park the vehicle.,
Locate the release latch.,
Test the interior release latch.,
Slap the hood to get it unstuck.,
Attempt to open the hood with an assistant.,
Leave the engine running in cold weather.,
Inspect the latch after opening.",How to Open the Hood of a Vehicle2," Park the car on a level surface and engage the parking brake. Park at home or at an auto garage if possible. If it turns out you can't fix the problem on the spot, you don't want to be forced to close your hood again to drive to a mechanic.

, If you're not familiar with the car, look for the interior release latch under the steering wheel, low down near the driver's door, or in the corner of the glove box. This often has a picture of a car with an open hood.


Some older cars only have an exterior release. Look for a latch under the front lip of the hood.
If you are locked out of the car, skip ahead to fixes that do not require interior access.

, When working correctly, this causes the hood to move upward a short distance. If you hear a noise but the hood does not move at all, the hood is probably stuck. Continue to the next step to fix it. If you do not hear anything, there's likely a problem with the cable or latch mechanism. Skip down to the next section.


If the hood does open partially, all you need to do is press the exterior latch at the front of the hood. This latch is usually at the center or just to one side, and may depress upward or to the side.

, Stand outside the driver's seat and reach in to hold the interior release in the fully pulled position. With your other hand, slap the hood with an open palm.If you're lucky, the hood just needs a jolt.


Take care not to dent your hood. You may need to use force, but keep your hand in an open palm position.

, Have a friend pull the interior release and keep it in that position. Stand at the front of the vehicle and pull up on the hood slowly but steadily.If the only problem is rust or grime, you can usually overcome it. If the hood won't budge, don't force it.

, Chilly weather or frost can cause the hood to stick. Let the engine idle for a while to thaw frozen parts, then try opening the hood again.If the hood still won't open, the cable or latch mechanism might be at fault. Continue to the next section to keep troubleshooting.


, Once you get your hood open, check for broken latch parts or a frayed cable, which needs replacing. If you don't see obvious problems, just lubricate the latch with a penetrating oil.It may also help to lubricate the cable with a spray lubricant. Insert the straw nozzle at the cable's end, between the inner cable and outer sheath. Pinch the area with a cloth and spray.
Do not use silicone spray under your hood. It can contaminate the oxygen sensor, throwing off engine performance.

Mount.,
Buy yourself a nice dinner.,


",How to Make Your Own Roof Crossbars,"  On a 2004 Jeep Liberty, there are 4 factory-drilled holes on the top of the crossbars.  If you line up the bars with those holes, which guaranteed they’d be parallel to each other.;
,  If you’re interested in adding eye bolts to help tie down loads, this is a good point to drill holes for them. 


Find out what diameter your eye bolts are. 
Choose a drill bit that is exactly the same size. 

Note: even if you don’t want to have the eye bolts on your bars all the time, you might as well drill the holes now so that you don’t have to later.  Since you’re just using ordinary hardware, you can add or remove the eye bolts anytime you want.



,


 Lay the crossbars on your side rails and grab one of your U-bolts. 
Using your U-bolt, mark where holes need to be drilled on the underside of your crossbar. 
Repeat for the other side, and the second bar. 
Drill where you marked.  

Note: you’ll notice in the early pictures that four holes are drilled per side, and none are drilled for the U-bolts. The original plan was to secure the crossbars using regular hex bolts inserted through the crossbar and into the side rail. U-bolts were used instead, so those holes became superfluous.



, Notice that the side rails on the Jeep are curved.  That is the case for most vehicles. 


If you use square tubing and just rest the tubes on the curved side rails, nothing will sit flat across your cross bars, and they will look bad. 
One solution is to use circular steel tubing.  The other solution is to grind out some metal from each place where the tubing rests on the side rails.  You’ll need a metal grinder for this step. 
Take off a tiny bit at a time until you see that the bars are beginning to line up parallel.

,  When you see that the bars will sit the way you want them to, choose a color of spray paint, hang your rails and hardware, and paint them.  This is strictly unnecessary, but the extra effort and $5 will make your DIY crossbars look great.

,  Once everything is dry, place your crossbars on the side rails, slide the U-bolts through underneath, and tighten the nuts until it becomes somewhat difficult to turn the wrench by hand.  If you want to prevent scratching to the side bars, add a small piece of gasket between the side bars and the cross bars before tightening the U-bolts.  You want the U-bolts to be firm, but they don’t need to be so tight that they crush your side rails.  You should be able to grab a hold of the rails and rock the vehicle without the bars moving.

,  You just saved somewhere between $50-$200 dollars!

Finished.

",How to Maintain Car Bodywork," Washing your car will remove salt, dirt, and other debris from the surface of your car; all of which can cause permanent stains, rusting, and corrosion if not removed.


Wash the areas underneath your car to remove excess dirt and salt; especially during cold months when salt has been placed on roads to melt snow. If salt is left on your car, it will cause those sections to corrode.
To wash the sections underneath your car, use a pressure-washing hose at a coin-operated car wash, or drive through an automatic car wash that will shoot jets of water under your car.
Wash or spray the insides of your car's wheel arches and underneath the bumper area to remove any dirt or salt hidden from view.;
, Bird droppings contain abrasive and acidic properties that may permanently stain your car if they are not removed immediately.

, Waxing will help protect the paint on your car and prevent corrosion by blocking water that may seep into scratches and chips on your car's surface.


Purchase a non-abrasive car wax from an automotive store and apply it to your car's surface using a large soft sponge or a soft cloth.
Apply the wax only to the painted sections of your car. If you apply wax to the rubber or plastic parts of your car, it may cause those parts to stain permanently.
If you accidentally apply wax to the rubber or plastic parts of your car, remove it immediately using a commercial glass cleaning product.
Buff the car with a clean, soft cloth until all the wax has been removed from the surface of your car.

, Rustproofing your car is ideal if you live in a humid climate or if your car comes into contact with salt in the air or on the roads. A rustproofing product will add extra protection to the bodywork of your car and help prevent corrosion.


Purchase a commercial rustproofing agent from any automotive repair store and apply it to your car following the directions provided by the product's manufacturer.

, This will prevent the affected areas of your bodywork from corroding.


Obtain touch-up paint from your car's manufacturer or dealer in the exact color of your car. If you are unsure of your car's color, ask your dealer to tell you where to locate the color code on your car.
Squeeze a small amount of paint into the cap of the tube, then dip the point of a wooden toothpick into the paint.
Use the toothpick to slowly apply the paint to the chipped or scratched area of your car.
Refer to the directions of your touch-up paint to determine how long the paint needs to dry before you apply the clear coating. The clear coat is usually located at the other end of the touch-up paint tube.

, This procedure will cover and hide any small scratches on your car's surface.


Purchase a commercial car polishing product from an automotive retail store.
Apply a small amount of polish to the applicator included with the product and gently rub the affected area. You may want to test a small area first, just to familiarize yourself with the abrasiveness of the polish.
Check the scratched area to see if the scratch is still visible. If so, continue to gently polish until the scratch is no longer clearly visible.
Wash the affected areas with soap and water to remove the polish after the scratches have been repaired.
Apply car wax to the areas you have treated with polish to buff and shine the surface areas.

Wash the top using car wash soap.,
Use a convertible top cleaner designed for vinyl.,
Use a brush to gently scrub the vinyl.,
Spray on a cleaner that prevents mildew.,
Apply a vinyl protectant.",How to Maintain a Convertible1," Vinyl convertible tops are designed to be washed along with the rest of the car using traditional automotive soaps. Follow the directions provided on your car wash soap of choice when mixing it with water to ensure you wash the top using the proper ratio of soap to water to avoid drying the top out. Avoid using any soap with bleaches or strong detergents on your car or vinyl top. If your vinyl top is in good condition, washing it with car wash soap is a great way to keep it clean.
As with your car, do not wash a vinyl top in direct sunlight, as it may cause the soap to dry onto the vinyl.;
, If your vinyl top is particularly dirty, you can use a convertible top cleaner that is specially designed to properly clean and protect vinyl. Read the instructions for use when purchasing vinyl top cleaner to ensure you use it properly and always clean the entire top at once. Cleaning the top in sections can result in the vinyl’s color fading at different rates.There are a number of brands that offer vinyl top cleaners such as Maguire’s, Wolfgang and RaggTopp.
Make sure to rinse the top thoroughly after using a vinyl cleaner.

, If your vinyl convertible top has hard to remove dirt and debris stuck to it, you can incorporate a medium to soft toothed brush when cleaning it. Spray vinyl top cleaner on the convertible top, then scrub the area gently with the brush until the debris comes loose.Do not ever use a steel bristled brush on your vinyl top.

, Vinyl tops can be a breeding ground for mildew in high humidity areas. To prevent mildew from developing, choose a vinyl cleaner that includes an anti-mildew agent designed specifically for vinyl if you live in an area that rains frequently or regularly experiences high levels of humidity.Vinyl top cleaners that include anti-mildew agents will be clearly labeled.
Do not use a household mildew remover on your vinyl top, as it may damage the material.

, Make sure the top is completely dry before spraying on a vinyl protectant. These protectants can prevent the top from fading in the sun and help to maintain its waterproof seal. Vinyl protectants should be applied with increasing regularity on older vehicles.After about seven years, you should apply a vinyl protectant to your convertible top every few months.
If your vehicle sits in direct sunlight often, you may want to apply vinyl protector more often.

"

Use a cleaner designed for fabric.,
Use a moderately stiff brush to scrub the top.,
Look for signs of failing water repellence.,
Apply a water repellent to a clean, dry top.,
Reapply water repellent monthly.",How to Maintain a Convertible2," Cloth convertible tops are not as resilient as vinyl, and as a result, should only be washed using products designed specifically to clean them. Try to avoid getting traditional car wash soap on your cloth convertible top during normal washing, then apply a cleaner designed for cloth tops after.You can purchase cloth convertible top cleaners at most auto parts stores.
Regular car wash soap can dry out a cloth top and compromise its water proof seal over time.

, If your cloth top has debris or stuck on dirt that won’t come off easily, use a moderately stiff brush to scrub the cloth top cleaner into the fabric. A short bristled, moderately stiff brush will remove the stuck on material without damaging the cloth.Apply the cleaner to the top, then scrub it in with the brush gently until the dirt comes off.
Rinse the top thoroughly after you’re done using a hose.

, Cloth tops are treated at the factory to water proof them, but over time the cloth’s ability to prevent water from seeping through will begin to fade. Look in your car for puddles or wet fabric after a heavy rain. If the inside of your car has some wet spots, it is likely that the water repellent treatment in your cloth convertible top has worn off.The inside of your car should remain dry during rain storms. If you spot wet areas, you may need to reapply a water repellent to the cloth top.
Water inside your car could also indicate a failed seal around a window or door. Check to make sure the seals in your vehicle aren’t cracked or torn when you find water inside it.

, If you think your cloth top is no longer effectively repelling water, you can apply a water repellant to it that is designed for cloth convertible tops. Spray the repellent on the top evenly while it is completely dry. Depending on the repellant you use, you may need to apply multiple coats.Some cloth top sealers require that you allow one coat to dry before applying another one.
Be careful to apply the water repellent sealer evenly to avoid discoloration of your cloth top due to some areas having better protection than others.

, If you find that your car’s convertible top needs to have water repellant reapplied to it, you will likely need to apply the sealant regularly from that point forward. If you store your vehicle in a garage, you may be able to reapply the sealant every few months, otherwise you should plan to re-apply the sealant monthly.The initial treatment of water repellent sealer provided by the factory can last for years, but new applications you do yourself are usually only good for a month or two.
Failing to re-seal your cloth top could result in significant leaks and even mold.

"
"
Refer to your owner’s manual.,
Look for signs of fuzz or lint.,
Rub a small amount of water into the top.,
Assess whether the water smears or absorbs into the top.",How to Maintain a Convertible3," If you are unsure whether or not your vehicle has a cloth or vinyl top, an easy way to be sure is to refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual. The owner’s manual should indicate what type of material the top is made of, as well as recommended actions you can take to prolong the life of your convertible top.If you do not have the owner’s manual, try referring to the auto maker’s website.

, Vinyl tops have more of a plastic seeming finish to them than cloth tops do, so they react differently to things like lint. Whereas lint and fuzz will blow right off of a vinyl convertible top, it will often stick directly to a cloth top. If you see lint stuck to your top, it is likely made of cloth.If you do not see any lint or fuzz on the top, try rubbing a small piece of drier lint on the convertible top. If it does not stick, it is likely vinyl.

, Another easy way to assess whether or not your convertible top is made of cloth or vinyl is to pour a small amount of water onto the top and then rubbing it around with your fingers. Bring a cup of water and a spoon out to your vehicle. Use the spoon to apply a small amount of water to the convertible top, then press you index and middle fingers into the water and rub it around.You will need less than a spoonful of water to successfully test the material of the top.
You can pour the water directly from the cup, but be careful not to pour too much or it will saturate the top and make it harder to determine its material.

, After you pour the water on the top and rub it around with your fingers observe where the water goes. If it remains at the surface and swishes around as you rub it, the top is likely made of vinyl. If the water absorbs into the material of the top, it is made of cloth.Pouring too much water on the top will result in the water swishing around at the surface regardless of the material.
This test can be conducted anywhere on the convertible top.

Do not leave the top down overnight.,
Check to make sure the deck is clear when putting the top down.,
Treat vinyl windows with a cleaner and protectant.,
Reduce yellowing of glazing on vinyl windows with a lens glaze.",How to Maintain a Convertible4," When your convertible top is down, it is folded up tightly in the deck of the vehicle. For a well-conditioned top, this isn’t an issue, but if you leave the top folded for too long, it may result in defined fold lines or even cracks developing in the convertible top’s material.Always put the top up before storing your vehicle or parking it for the night.
It can be impossible to remove lines or cracks in the top without replacing the convertible top itself.

, Whether your convertible folds up automatically or manually, it can be damaged if it is folded onto something. Always make sure the area the top folds into is clear of obstructions and that there is nothing stored in the top’s compartment, otherwise the material of the top or the metal frame for it could be damaged.Check the top’s compartment to ensure nothing has fallen into it before folding the top down.
Make sure nothing is resting on top of the convertible top while it is folded as well.

, Some convertible tops come equipped with vinyl windows. These windows can yellow over time due to exposure to sunlight and accumulating dirt, so use a high quality vinyl cleaner on rear windows if they aren’t made of glass.You can determine if your top is made of glass or vinyl by seeing if it bends. A glass window will not bend.
If your top is also made of vinyl, you may use the same vinyl cleaner to clean the window.

, If your vinyl window has already yellowed, you can purchase a vinyl lens glaze product at most auto parts stores. These cleaners spray onto the vinyl and remove the yellowing, making the window clear once again.Poorly maintained vinyl windows can reduce visibility out of the back of the vehicle.
If your vinyl window is too dark to see though, you may need to have it replaced by a professional.

Cut a thick piece of cardboard about 6 by 6 inches (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm).,
Open the can and mix the Bondo with a stir stick if there is a layer of liquid on top.,
Add 1 line of hardener--also known as a catalyst or fixing agent--by squeezing it out of the tube across the top of the Bondo filler.,
Use an ice cream novelty stick or a plastic spreader to quickly mix the two substances together.",How to Mix Bondo," Alternatively, you can mix it on particle board or buy an inexpensive pad of disposable plastic sheets to mix the Bondo.;
, Use the stir stick to lift a golf ball-sized dollop of filler out of the can and reseal the can.


Mix a larger amount of Bondo and hardener if the area you need to patch is larger. Look at your project to estimate the amount of Bondo needed.

, (Bondo comes with a tube of hardener.)


If you add too much hardener, the mixture will gel too quickly. If you add too little, it increases the amount of time for it to cure, and if you don't add enough it will never cure. If you add 1 line of hardener across the top of the dollop of Bondo, it takes about 15 minutes to dry after applying. Add 2 lines and it takes about 5 minutes to dry. Experiment to get the right Bondo mixture.

, Do not whip them, but rather fold them to avoid introducing air bubbles.


Use hardener with dye in it so you can see when the mixture is mixed evenly. If there are no streaks in the filler or areas that are darker or lighter, it is mixed well.

Airlines, including small, commuter airlines will not hire you if you do not have a high school diploma.;

Flight crew schedulers spend the majority of their time at work on computers. Good typing skills are essential for obtaining a job as a flight crew scheduler.
Many airlines rely on computerized word processing, spreadsheet and database programs when scheduling flight crews. Expert knowledge in these types of programs is crucial to success as a flight crew scheduler.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secureflight regulations can be found at the TSA website.
Some airlines require the flight crew scheduler to also assist with the TSA SecureFlight procedure, which is a policy requiring all passengers to provide photo identification so that it may be checked against watch lists before a boarding pass is issued. Although not all airlines include this under the duties of the flight crew scheduler, knowing the regulations could be beneficial should the job description change.

,


Flight crew schedulers must be able to communicate with flight crews to be sure all regulations are met and all flights have adequate crew members.
Many local community colleges offer courses in communication that will help you develop the appropriate skills to become a successful flight crew scheduler.

, While some employers will hire licensed pilots with only a high school degree, most prefer at least two years of college. And if you ever dream of working for a major company, a degree is necessary. Since more and more people are getting them, they're becoming par for the course.At the minimum, complete general education requirements. We'll talk more on the what-you-need-to-know stuff later, but college starts you on the math, the English, and the physics skills. It also shows employers that you can commit to a strict regimen and succeed.
Some schools offer aviation degrees and even offer training as part of the degree. When you graduate, you'll have your Commercial Pilot License and a degree. This can be done through a four-year university or a technical program., The brunt of the obstacle when it comes to becoming a pilot is money and having to learn how to fly. A surefire way to solve that problem is to join the military. Not only is it financially easier, but major airlines definitely hold military pilots in high regard. If this is something you can see yourself doing, it's a good idea.


Now comes the reality check: Joining the military is no small decision. It's a commitment of a decade or so (depending on your branch), you have to be physically fit, have the right mindset, and be willing to risk your life. While it's a good route to becoming a pilot, it's not the only one.

, Woohoo, the fun part! If you decided to go the civilian route, you have two different options. And for the record, the FAA doesn't care how you go about it; a certificate is a certificate. Here's what you need to know:


You can go to a flight school (that's recognized by the FAA -- they've certified approximately 600 flight schools.). You'll need 190 hours of time logged to get your CPL. That's a little less than doing it privately. Another upside is that they'll help you get your Instrument Rating (IR), too.
You can learn to fly through a personal instructor (also needs to be certified through the FAA). This route takes 250 hours and can be a bit expensive (an hour of flying lessons is $80 or so dollars an hour).However, it's done on your own time. Your instructor may be part of a ""flight club.""

, The fact of the matter is that flying an airplane is awesome. Most everyone would consider it a great job. However, that's only a piece of the pie. In order to know if you'll succeed as a pilot, you have to know if you can make it through the academics of it all. So take a ground school course -- you'll be able to feel out if becoming a pilot is right for you.


In order to be a successful pilot (and have people's lives in your hands), you need to know what's going on around you. That means knowing the physics of flight, the intricacies of weather and geography, and the ins and outs of air traffic control. Ground school will get you started on all of this.

, Once you've started private flying lessons or training at your flight school, slowly but surely you'll move up in the ranks. There are many degrees of licenses and you'll be eligible for your first one almost off the bat. There's student, sport, recreational, and private license levels before you finally hit the CPL -- commercial pilot license. Each requires a specific number of hours in the air.Student pilot. There's actually no experience requirement; you just have to pass a test and hold the appropriate medical certificate. The restrictions for flying solo are quite heavy.

Sport Pilot. You can then fly with no more than one passenger (with limitations). You must log 20 hours of experience in addition to taking a test and holding a driver's license.

Recreational Pilot. This has largely been replaced by the Sport Pilot License.

Private Pilot. This is the license held by most pilots. You can take passengers, fly most aircraft, and operate charity flights -- you just can't receive compensation. This requires at least 40 hours of flying in a variety of circumstances.


Commercial Pilot. What this article is all about. You can fly pretty much anything (more complex machines may require certification), take others, and get paid. You need 250 hours in a variety of circumstances.



, Now that you've grown acquainted with the ropes, it's time to get your commercial license! Wahoo! This is when you can start getting paid to fly. You'll need 250 hours of flight time in various conditions and to pass a series of tests. Here are the basic requirements:


You must be at least 18 years old with a photo ID.
You need an endorsement or certificate from a certified flight instructor stating that you've completed ground training.
You need to score at least 70 percent on written and multiple choice tests.
You need to pass the flight exam (given by an instructor).
You need to pass a physical exam that shows you have 20/20 corrected vision and there are no impairments that would interfere with your ability to pilot a plane. To fly for hire, you'll need at least a second-class medical certificate.
You'll need to pass a multi-engine check ride if you want to fly more complex planes., Without being IR certified, you are not allowed to fly in poor weather, even with your Commercial Pilot License. You do not have to wait to have your CPL to do this, but once you have your CPL, you should definite have the IR!


For example, altimeters, which measure your height above the ground, are just one of the many instruments that pilots must use. You'll need to demonstrate that you can depend on instruments in periods of low visibility. It is a written and tactile exam., Most starting-out pilots first become instructors. It's a good way to keep flying, increase your hours, and still get paid. With a bit of experience under your belt, you could get into flying corporate planes. Salaries range from $20,000 to $80,000 a year.However, you could also look into banner towing, agricultural applications, charter planes, helicopters, and aerial photography.There are many routes to making money with this license -- especially since you put so much money into it!

, The next step up after getting your CPL is getting your Airline Transport Pilot License. Then you can work in any plane and get real paid. You'll need to bank 1,500 hours of flying (in multiple conditions), have an IR, be 23, and pass all the tests.But it will be worth it!


As stated in the intro, co-pilots used to be able to only hold CPLs. Now they too must have their ATP licenses. If you want to be flying for an airline, major or not, this is the only way to do it.

, In addition to all the written tests and the hands-on exams, you'll need to pass a pretty thorough background check. They'll do drug tests and credit checks, in addition to personality and intellect exams. If you have any bad habits, well, kick 'em now.


You cannot have any felonies on your record. DUIs and misdemeanors are...okay (for lack of a better word), but a significant amount of time needs to pass between the mishap and the hiring for your employer to turn the other way (at least in most circumstances)., Working for an airline is all about seniority. Most people start as flight engineers, become co-pilots, and then finally captains. Even if you've had years of experience, with a new company, you'll need to start from the bottom.


This happens within the company. That is, once you're a captain for United, switching to Delta puts you back down at engineer level. It's impossible to able to predict the future of an airline company (even veritable behemoths like Pan Am and Eastern have fallen), but if you can get into a stable one, well, that's the most you can do.

, Because working for an airline is all about seniority, it's all about timing. You could start as an engineer and find an opening in 3 years, or you could start as an engineer and be stuck there for 7. There's not much you can do, but it is good to know now so you have time to accept it!


Today's economy isn't helping future pilots any. There's little in the realm of job security what with cutbacks, government shut downs, bankruptcies, and the like. While the BLS does say the market is growing at an average rate, jobs at major airlines will be hard to come by due to fierce competition., Knowing how to fly a plane is very little of what you're actually doing -- you need to be able to assess everything around you, including yourself! The difference between a decent pilot and a great pilot really becomes evident when trouble arises. It's in your best interest to read up on all you can and to search out resources and connections.


Just because you can use the internet doesn't mean you know how it works. It's the same with a plane. Being able to fly it doesn't mean you get it. In order to keep the lives of others as safe as possible, you should be able to understand the theory of flight, navigation, aircraft systems, meteorology, geography, and the laws by which you must abide by. There's always more to learn!

, Being a pilot may seem glamorous, but it's a hard job. There are a number of things to take into consideration, apart from the stuff we've already covered about job security and seniority.


You'll be away from home for about half your life. If you have a family (or want one), this can take a serious toll. It also takes a serious toll on you! You'll be living out of a suitcase more often than not.
If your physical or mental health ever starts failing you (for the record, there's mandatory retirement at 65), you may be out of a job. Pilots have to be in good mental and physical shape to be trusted with all that responsibility.
If you're ever laid off, you're back at the bottom of the pilot food chain.

, Piloting a plane requires the ability to respond quickly to a problem, to assess a situation responsibly, and to accurately assess what's going in the first place. It's a job that requires being able to handle stress and weird sleep schedules if you're flying for an airline. Can you do it?


Did we mention depth perception? That's (hopefully) an obvious one. But there's also teamwork and communication skills (your co-pilot, the air traffic controllers) in addition to an attention to detail. If this sounds like you, great! You've found your calling!

Log 500 hours of flight time.,
Be aware that different companies have different requirements.,
Build time by giving flight instruction.,
Start your first Alaska flying job in Bethel.,
Take the additional actions necessary if you're a foreign pilot.,
Begin a serious job search with face-to-face interviews and trim your cover letter and resume to one page.,
Be prepared for interviews by doing your homework first.",How to Become an Alaska Bush Pilot," To fly as pilot-in-command under FARs Part 135 requires a minimum of 500 hours of flight time. Of that 500 hours, 100 hours has to be cross-country time. And of that 100 hours, 25 hours has to be night cross-country time.


How does the FAA define cross country time? The explanation below was originally posted by the Office of the Chief Counsel, FAA: ""Cross country flight time is defined as time acquired during a flight that includes a point of landing that is at least a straight-line distance of more than 50 nautical miles from the original point of departure, not the original point of any flight leg. There is no requirement that any specific leg must be 50 nm. Moreover, a cross-country flight may include several legs that are less than a straight-line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure. Nevertheless, at least one leg of the cross-country flight, however long by itself, must include a point of landing that is at least a straight-line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure.""In other words, each cross-country flight used to meet the aeronautical experience requirements under 14 CFR 61.1(b)(3) must include one leg that includes a landing that is at least a straight-line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure.;
, The reality is that there are some Alaska operators who will hire a pilot with just the Part 135 minimums of 500 hours. But, most Alaska operators require 1000 hours or more in a new hire. Many of them also prefer to see some Alaska time or equivalent i.e. mountain time and/or Pacific Northwest time. For the most part, insurance companies are responsible for these pilot-employment requirements.

, If you're a low-time commercial pilot and want to build flight hours toward an eventual Alaska flying job, the best way is to give flight instruction.


There are several flight schools in Alaska. A couple of them specialize in bush flying techniques. The others are geared toward gaining the desired licenses and ratings. With CFI or CFI-I certification, you could land a job with an Alaska flight school. This is a great way to build up some Alaska time. If you decide to acquire CFI or CFI-I certification from an Alaska-based flight school, there is the possibility that the school would hire you to give flight instruction.
Teaching at an Anchorage-based flight school might be the best route toward your getting a regular flying job. The reason being, that the Anchorage area has the biggest aviation community in the state and you would get to know people who would be in a position to help you find that job when you have logged enough flight time. You would also learn a bunch more than you already know by giving instruction. And as you got to know more fellow aviators, you might also learn a lot about which companies are really cool to work for and which ones may not be so cool.

,


The town of Bethel is one of the Alaska locations where pilots new to Alaska obtain their first flying job. There is a fairly high turnover of pilots in Bethel because it is not an ideal place to live for most pilots. Nevertheless, Bethel is the main aviation hub for more than 50 Eskimo villages within the greater Yukon-Kuskokwim delta area.Flying out of Bethel is busier during the winter months than in the summer and is consequently a year-round job. Most of the flights in and out of Bethel are not tourism-related, but primarily provide mail/ cargo delivery and transportation for villagers travelling to and from other villages. During the summer months many villagers are employed in other parts of Alaska i.e. commercial fishing, mining operations, and other Alaska industries.

, Pilots from countries other than the USA would be required to have Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial license and a work visa to be legally employed as a pilot in Alaska or anywhere else in the US. Under current FAA regulations, a JAA pilot license of any level (private, commercial, or ATP) will convert only to a FAA private pilot certificate. To convert a JAA commercial license or ATP license to the equivalent FAA license requires passing FAA written, oral and practical test.,


When the time comes to begin a serious job search, the most effective way is face-to-face meetings with Chief Pilots, owners, or Directors of Operations (whoever does the hiring of pilots). In a face-to-face interview for an Alaska flying job, you should dress neatly, but not in a suit and tie. This would require a trip to Alaska if you're living elsewhere and would require some careful planning to optimize your time and expense. Anchorage or Fairbanks would be the best places for launching a face-to-face job hunt.
If you are unable to plan a trip to Alaska, then the next best method is by sending out cover letters and resumes. A one-page cover letter should be tailored specifically to each company you're contacting. If possible it should include words indicating that you know quite a lot about the company.

, Company websites are good sources of information. Your one-page-only resume can be more generic but you might consider tailoring your ""Objective"" to each individual company. Do some research on effective resume writing.


Alaska air taxi operators are mostly interested in your flying experience and in any previous employment as a pilot. So, unless you think it is truly relevant to a prospective employer, your previous work history that is not related to flying is best excluded or at least minimized. An exception to that might be citing exceptional skills in dealing with customers. A college degree is not as important for a bush flying job as flying experience.

Get a four-year college degree.,
Look around your local area for a good flight school and flight instructor to begin working on your private pilot certificate.,
Get a First Class medical certificate from a Federal Aviation Administration medical examiner.",How to Become an Airline Pilot1," While a college degree is not required to fly for any of the regional airlines in the United States, a four year degree is required to fly for a major US airline. It's preferable to get a Bachelor of Science degree with an emphasis in aviation (but your degree doesn't necessarily have to be aviation related). Airline pilot training is intense and expensive. A college degree helps to demonstrate to the airline that you will be capable of completing their education program.;
, The FAA minimum flight time is 40 hours, but the average is around 60. Schools with FAA oversight can be more desirable if you want a highly regimented training program.

, It is better to apply for a first class medical the first time you apply for a medical certificate to be sure you will qualify for one before you have invested too much time and money into your new career choice.

The DOD will hire civilian air traffic controllers over 30; however, the FAA will not train people with no prior experience who are older than 30.


Civilian air traffic controllers who work for the Defense Department can also transfer to the FAA, provided they were 30 or younger when hired by the DOD.;
, The FAA only accepts citizens of the United States for its training programs.

, You can qualify to become an air traffic controller for the FAA if you meet one of the following requirements:


Have a continuous year of experience as a civilian or military air traffic controller.
Have 3 years of (any) work experience, a bachelor's degree or some equivalent combination of work experience and collegiate study. The FAA considers a year of college, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours, equal to 9 months of work. Your experience and coursework should be of a nature that shows you can handle the duties of being an air traffic controller.
Complete the FAA's Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) 2- or 4-year program and receive an official recommendation from the school whose program you attended. More information about this program is available from the FAA here.

, In 1981, President Reagan famously fired a whole bunch of striking ATCs. As a result, those who were newly hired then are now retiring. In 2009, there was a huge spike in numbers and now that number is being forced to drop.4 years ago would've been a great time to become an ATC, but job prospects are a bit bleaker now.


The BLS has job growth at a -3% rate. If you do want employment, it's preferred that you have military experience or rock the AT-CTI program., If you're not already landing planes in the military (and most of us aren't), it's safe to say you're considering the two other paths: either getting hired directly by the FAA or going to an FAA-affiliated school. Let's cover both paths.


If you're a regular Joe, you can wait for the FAA to announce an open posting on the USAJobs website. You must see the word PUBNAT in the title (stands for ""public national"" and is open to, you guessed it, the public) -- if that word isn't there, it is not open to the general public. Make sure to fill out all the information (and correctly) on the online application. If you don't, your application may be overlooked.
If you're a regular Joe with time, money, and academic motivation, find a school that has an AT-CTI program -- a complete list can be found here. It's either a 2-year or 4-year program. If you go this route and complete it, you will be expedited through the process (though there is no guarantee of employment).

, 4 to 8 weeks after the PUBNAT announcement closes or 6 months prior to your graduation, you will be asked to take the AT-SAT (so check your email).When there are more applicants than testing slots, applicants are chosen at random. If you completed an AT-CTI program and weren't selected when you first applied to take the test, you are given priority for the next testing session provided you still meet the other requirements.


The written test is a comprehensive, computer-administered test designed to evaluate your ability to learn how to be an air traffic controller. They will give you 8 hours with 75 minutes for breaks.You will be asked math questions, airplane control/dial questions, questions on radar, angles, and different flight scenarios, etc.
Wondering how to study for it? Air Traffic Control Career Prep by Patrick Mattson is a good place to start., If you scored above 70 or above, you may get placed onto a referral list. You need to get on this list to proceed any further. Even if you do score a 70, you are not necessarily guaranteed anything -- there could be 14,395 people that got a 70.1. You will be notified via phone or email if you qualify.


If you scored 70 to 84.9 you are deemed qualified. If you scored 85 and above, you are deemed well-qualified.Obviously, the FAA goes through the well-qualified list first.

, Once you're on the referral list, there are two routes you may be ushered through: the expedited route (at a PEPC (a pre-employment processing center) or the traditional route (at some local facility). Either way, eventually you'll get all your screenings and interview done -- this will be discussed in the next section, but you'll get notified of your path now.


This should all be done in one day (probably). If that's the case for you, take some food with you and dress to impress. You'll be there all day (and there will only be candy and waterand you'll be surrounded by people that are judging you as a possible candidate for this job. Leave the overalls at home.

, Along will all the other stuff that will pile up in your inbox, you'll get notice to fill out your e-QIP. This is just a questionnaire you must fill out -- the electronic version of the SF-85/86 for Public Trust Positions.Be sure to do this -- it's the step that must be completed before the government initiates security checks on you (yay).


If you're a terminal applicant, you'll fill out the SF-85. If you're an en route applicant, the SF-86.

There are different types of air traffic controllers for different segments of flight. Tower controllers go from the gate to 5 miles (8.0 km) or so from the airport; approach controllers have the aircraft from about 60 miles (97 km) from the airport (below 18,000 ft); the center controller has the craft through higher altitudes to it's destination, where the process gets reversed., That stands for the Minnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory. It's pretty standard for all FAA, DoD, and CIA jobs. It's basically identifying your personality structure and your psychopathology. Whatever you do, don't answer the 567 questions like you think they want you to answer them. Answering ""Have you ever lied?"" with ""No"" will raise a red flag.


Some of the questions are pretty ridiculous. Do you see animals that aren't there? Are people out to get you? Have you failed because others made you? Will people think you're nuts after you take this test because they want to see you fail?Dead serious. It's a lot of the same question over and over (in this case, ""are you paranoid?"") to see if you're consistent.
If you fail it, you're not necessarily outta the game. You'll just probably get back-logged in the system for about three months and dealt with then., You need to be able to handle the physical rigors of being an air traffic controller, including having normal color vision. Once hired, you'll have to have an annual physical and drug screen to assure that you're still fit for the job, in addition to a hearing exam, blood pressure exam, and an EKG.


The FAA does hire disabled veterans, provided their disabilities are such that they don't interfere with their ability to work as an air traffic controller
Bring all your medical records with you. If you have an incomplete file, the process will go slower than it already is.

, You know those questions employers ask you that you don't think they'll actually ever get around to verifying? Well, the FAA does that and takes it a step further. They will contact your references and people who know you. They will fingerprint you. They will research your criminal record exhaustively. They will check your credit. So everything you write down needs to be completely honest.


If you have debt, don't fret. Tons of us do. It's only if you have six figures and it's all due to a gambling addition or you spent it all on pineapples or something will an eyebrow raise.

, If you don't have previous experience as an air traffic controller, you must go through the FAA's testing and interview process. This is generally brief and to the point. The questions are fairly straightforward, talking about teamwork, stressful situations, and general questions any employer might ask.


The interview is designed to evaluate applicants on their alertness, poise, diction and ability to give instructions in as few words as possible. Candidates are also evaluated for their ability to handle large amounts of information and to make quick decisions.
You'll also be asked those super awesome questions like, ""Why would you make a good ATC?"" and ""Where do you see your career going?""Not exactly tough stuff.

, That's your Tentative Offer Letter. HR will handle this. Once you get it (don't pester them for it; it'll come), it'll have your employment facility (in other words, where you'll be working) and how much you'll get paid. This is only a guarantee of employment IF you pass all the background checks and whatnot. Don't start celebrating just yet.

, After it's all been cleared, your HR rep should call you and confirm when you'll be starting your classes. Each new ATC has to go through the FAA Academy before they begin work. They'll give you a time and a place -- would you like to have the spot reserved for you in the class? WHY, YES, YES YOU WOULD.


Don't say no. A jillion other people are waiting for this offer, too. If you say no now, it could never happen again.

, The FAA Academy, located in Oklahoma City, trains those who pass the test for 12 weeks in the fundamentals of being an air traffic controller. Coursework includes FAA regulations, the airway system, how various aircraft perform and the use of equipment on the job.


Those who graduated from the AT-CTI program can bypass the first 5 weeks of the Academy.

, FAA Academy graduates are assigned to a facility where they work as ""developmental controllers"" under the supervision of experienced air traffic controllers. New controllers can expect to be certified within 2 to 4 years, depending on their performance and the availability of the facility staff to train them, while controllers with previous experience usually take less time to earn FAA certification.


Once certified, you're subject to semiannual reviews of your performance. This is standard for any serious career.
That six figure salary the BLS boastsisn't easy to come by. You'll need to work your way up the totem pole to find one of those., You're gonna be doing some pretty cool stuff. Without you, those souls flying through the air would be up a creek without a paddle. While your job is really cool, it's also intense. You have to focus the entire time you're on the job. That's 8 hours of constant concentration.


This job, while not physically exhausting, can be very mentally exhausting. It's not your average desk job. Airports run pretty much 24/7, so there's always things to be done. If you're a stickler for rest and relaxation, this isn't the career for you.

, Because of how planes are scheduled, you won't have consistent day, afternoon, or night shifts. If Ron works all the mornings and Sue works all the nights, Ron's constantly landing 3,429 planes at a time while Sue gets to read a book while she waits for United Flight 101 to come in. Tuesday you'll work in the morning and Wednesday you'll work graveyard to keep it balanced. In short, stay awake.


Actually, ATCs falling asleep on the job is actually becoming a problem. As a result, they can no longer work alone during night shifts. However, scheduling is staying the same (it's only fair) and the shifts are, too (generally 8 hours long). If you have a family, this can put a serious damper on your bonding., You will be presented with a number of stressful situations. If nothing else, you'll be asked to do a 258 things at once. It's important that you keep a level head and don't freak out. You've been trained. You know what to do. Everything will be fine.


If you remember to breathe, you'll be better off. Think of your training, what your superior would do, and handle the moment. It'll be over before you know it. When the rush hour ends, you can sit back with your coffee, start a conversation with the interesting ex-military guy you've been working with for a few months now, and take in how incredible your job is. Kudos!

, The stresses of being an air traffic controller are innumerable. If something goes wrong, you may end up blaming yourself and, beating around the bush aside, losing it. It's easy to get shaken, especially in the beginning.It's imperative that you understand that this career choice is the very definition of demanding. Sure, busier airports will require more of you, but every position (regardless of its location) will deprive you of sleep, demand ultimate concentration, and can be potentially quite jarring. Got it?


They never said it'd be easy; they said it'd be worth it, right? This is a very, very respectable job -- it's simply important to know the benefits and drawbacks going in. When you go in with a level head, you're more likely to succeed.

After you earn your private pilot license, begin working on your instrument rating and commercial certificate.,
Complete your certified flight instructor (CFI) rating and begin working at your flight school.,
Work on your multi-engine, certified flight instructor instrument (CFII), and multi-engine instructor (MEI) ratings.

",How to Become an Airline Pilot2," An instrument rating requires 50 hours of cross country Pilot-in-Command (PIC) and 40 hours of actual or simulated instrument conditions. For the commercial certificate, you will need 250 hours total time, 100 hours PIC, 50 hours cross country, and 10 hours of dual instruction in a complex aircraft.


All pilots who are paid to transport passengers or cargo must get a commercial pilot’s license with an instrument rating issued by the FAA. Helicopter pilots also must hold a commercial pilot’s license with a helicopter rating.

, Some flight schools offer you flight hours in exchange for instructing for them. This can be useful when you go on to your multi-engine rating.


Pilots need flight experience to qualify for a license. Completing classes at a flight school approved by the FAA can reduce the amount of flight experience required for a pilot’s license. In 2006, the FAA certified about 600 civilian flying schools, including some colleges and universities that offer degree credit for pilot training.
Initial training for airline pilots typically includes a week of company indoctrination; three to six weeks of ground school and simulator training; and 25 hours of initial operating experience, including a check-ride with an FAA aviation safety inspector. Once trained, pilots are required to attend recurrent training and simulator checks once or twice a year throughout their career.
To qualify for FAA licensure, applicants must be at least 18 years old and have at least 250 hours of flight experience.

With the proper ratings and 1500 hours of flight time, you could get hired by any number of regional airlines flying turboprop and regional-jet aircraft.,
Consider military flight training.,
Seek a variety of flying jobs.",How to Become an Airline Pilot3,"


To work for a major airline, you will typically need 3,000 hours total flight time including at least 1,500 hours multi-engine, and at least 1000 hours as pilot in command (PIC) of turbine (jet) powered aircraft, preferably in scheduled airline flying and in type of aircraft. These numbers are estimates and will vary depending on the airline. Also, while these may be the minimums required to apply for a job at a major airline, they may be far from the actual competitive numbers and the actual experience of successful applicants may be considerably higher than the minimums.
Airline pilots must fulfill additional requirements. Both Captains and First Officers must have an airline transport pilot’s license. Applicants for this license must be at least 23 years old and have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flying experience, including night and instrument flying, and must pass FAA written and flight examinations. Usually, they also have one or more advanced ratings depending on the requirements of their particular job. Because pilots must be able to make quick decisions and accurate judgments under pressure, many airline companies reject applicants who do not pass required psychological and aptitude tests. All licenses are valid so long as a pilot can pass the periodic physical and eye examinations and tests of flying skills required by the FAA and company regulations.
Companies other than airlines usually require less flying experience. However, a commercial pilot’s license is a minimum requirement, and employers prefer applicants who have experience in the type of craft they will be flying. New employees usually start as first officers, or fly less sophisticated equipment.
Depending on the type of aircraft, new airline pilots start as first officers or flight engineers. Although some airlines favor applicants who already have a flight engineer’s license, they may provide flight engineer training for those who have only the commercial license. Many pilots begin with smaller regional or commuter airlines, where they obtain experience flying passengers on scheduled flights into busy airports in all weather conditions. These jobs often lead to higher paying jobs with bigger, national or major airlines.

, The Air Force, Navy (includes Marine pilots), Army, and Coast Guard offer flight training. In the case of the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard, after initial training (a little over a year) you can go back to civilian life and, once you have enough hours, qualify to fly with an airline. Remember that US companies must allow their reservists and guard members to do their active duty drills without repercussion.


Other options would be to go to a 4-year college such as the University of North Dakota or a flight academy, such as Embry-Riddle. Both offer flight training in concurrence with academic classes, but make sure to research tuition and fees. Another is the Delta Connection Academy, which is quite costly, but upon completing the course, you may be offered an entry-level interview as a pilot instructor, which may later lead to a job with Delta connection.
There are no schools in the US that guarantee a position as a pilot for any company, and especially not a major airline.

, To advance to the pinnacle of your profession, you'll need to gain experience in any number of creative ways. For example:


Try teaching. Many pilots start their careers as flight instructors.
Take assignments with charter planes or air-taxi companies.
Go private. Don't forget about opportunities flying corporate planes.
And some pilots take jobs as flight engineers with the airlines.

"
Apply to airlines you would like to fly for as soon as you have the minimum requirements.,
Prepare for the Interview

Make sure your logbook is complete and you have an accurate record of your flight time.",How to Become an Airline Pilot4,"

Prepare a one page, professional pilot resume. The resume should be broken down into sections with your contact information, ratings and flight hours, experience and chronological job history and any awards or accomplishments.
Get recommendations. Have other pilots who have direct knowledge of your flying skills write letters of recommendation.
Fill out applications and update regularly. A search of the company website is a good place to look for minimum requirements and how to apply.

,
Collect records such as College Transcripts, Military Records, Licenses, Medical, Passport, Criminal Background Check and Driver's Records.
Prepare early for the interview. The interview can be stressful. There will usually be a story telling section with ""Tell us about a time when...."" questions, and technical questions. Check professional pilot websites where pilots share airline specific interview experiences.
Pay for a practice mock interview. There are several companies that offer resume review services and conduct mock interviews. The chance to practice in front of an audience and get unbiased feedback can be invaluable.
Simulator preparation. Get some practice time if the airline conducts a simulator check. Some companies offer airline specific interview simulator preparation.
Dress appropriately. Generally, a dark navy suit, black dress shoes and a conservative power tie.
Don't forget the ""Thank You Letter"". It's a professional courtesy to write a thank you letter addressed to your interviewers. Get their names before you leave, and make sure to take the time to write one.

In the airlines, advancement is usually predetermined by seniority provisions stated in union contracts.,
Gaining seniority will also help you acquire preferred flight assignments.",How to Become an Airline Pilot5," Expect a timetable like this:


After 1 -5 years, flight engineers advance according to seniority to first officer.
After 5 -15 years, a first officer will advance to captain.
Note: In non-airline jobs, a first officer may advance to captain and, in large companies, to chief pilot or director of aviation in charge of aircraft scheduling, maintenance, and flight procedures.

, Your time with the airline will determine when you fly, if you fly on weekends, or if you'll be in the air during Christmas or other holidays.

Know what the job entails.,
Get familiar with the benefits and drawbacks.,
Understand the hierarchy.,
Make sure the lifestyle is right for you.",How to Become a Flight Attendant1," Flight attendants are caregivers, customer service professionals, and safety providers. They ensure that passengers have a safe and calm passage while they’re on the plane. They work hard to make sure everyone's comfortable while constantly wearing a friendly smile. Their responsibilities include:


Greeting passengers as they board the plane, and thanking them as they exit.
Helping passengers get seating and stow their luggage in the overhead bins.
Giving a presentation of the airline’s safety procedures.
Facilitating beverage and food services.
Answering passengers’ questions, and calming passengers who are anxious or upset.
Guiding passengers to safety in the event of an emergency, and administering first aid if necessary.;
, In addition to getting the opportunity to travel all over the world on the job, flight attendants receive steeply discounted airline tickets for themselves and for their families. For many, this makes up for the fairly low pay (the entry-level salary is $18,000 per year) and the taxing hours a flight attendant must endure. A particularly grueling trip might include a ten-hour flight, a twenty-four-hour layover, another ten-hour flight, and so on. In addition to base pay, flight attendants also receive a ""per diem"" from under $2 to $3 per hour depending upon domestic or international assignments, to cover meals and incidental expenses while they are away from their base - even when on layover and not working. Thus, a flight attendant with a per diem of $3 per, receives an additional $72 for each day spent away from base.

, New flight attendant hires go through a few months of training before they become “junior” flight attendants. Junior flight attendants are under close scrutiny, and they receive lower pay and fewer benefits than “senior” flight attendants while they learn the ropes. After about a year of doing a satisfactory job, junior flight attendants get promoted to senior status, which gives them greater control over their hours.

, Since flight attendants travel so much, they often have to make personal sacrifices. But flight attendants function as each other’s family, and they provide each other with a lot of support. Flight attendants usually have the following qualities:


They’re fiercely independent. Flight attendants are able to navigate new places alone, and they enjoy being on their own, even if it means being away from their families during long trips.
They live in the moment. Many flight attendants explore the nightlife in the cities they visit, or take advantage of the attractions each city has to offer. They enjoy having new experiences and finding something great about every city.
They’re generous with time and space. Flight attendants don’t get a lot of personal space. They share their quarters with other flight attendants on longer trips. While flying, they have to put the customer first, even if they may be just as exhausted from being in the air for ten or more hours. Flight attendants have a cheerful attitude and uplift others under uncomfortable circumstances.

"
"
Meet the physical requirements.,
Have your GED.,
Have some customer service experience.",How to Become a Flight Attendant2," Each airline has different physical requirements tailored to the dimensions of their planes. Airlines want to make sure that flight attendants are tall enough to reach the overhead bins, but not so tall that their head hits the ceiling of the plane. Airlines also require that flight attendants be able to sit in a seat and buckle the seat belt comfortably.


The height range for most airlines is between 5’0” - 5’ 1” and 5’8” - 6’3”. Some airlines do not have height requirements, but instead require that you be able to reach a certain height.
The minimum age requirement ranges between 18-21 years old depending on the airline. There is no maximum age as long as you pass all medical requirements
There is no numerical weight requirement, but many airlines do a visual assessment, looking at weight in proportion to height.
In the 1960s, flight attendants were required to be females of a certain weight, and to retire before they reached a certain age. Some airlines continued these discriminatory practices through the 1980s and 1990s. Now men can be flight attendants, there is no numerical weight requirement, and people may continue working as flight attendants until they’re ready to retire.

, Airlines won’t hire people who don’t have their GED, but no higher education is required. That said, airlines do look favorably upon people who have a college degree, or even a few years of college under their belt. It shows that you’re ambitious and able to handle a challenge.


Some companies offer “flight training programs,” but this is not a requirement before applying to airlines. You’ll receive training if you’re hired as a flight attendant.

, The primary role of a flight attendant is to provide excellent customer service, so it really helps if you’ve worked in a similar role before. There are many types of jobs that count as customer service experience: answering phones for a company, working in retail, or working at the front desk of a small business all require interacting with and helping the public. This isn’t a mandatory requirement for all airlines, but it will help give you an edge.

"
"
Research airlines to find job openings.,
Apply to open jobs.,
Ace your interviews.,
Pass the medical exam.,
Excel during the training period.",How to Become a Flight Attendant3," Go to the websites of airlines that appeal to you and find their “careers” page. Make a list of all the jobs that appeal to you, and figure out whether you meet their requirements before proceeding.


Some cities host flight attendant “open houses” to give potential flight attendants the chance to learn more about the career and meet employers. Do an online search to find out if there’s an open house coming up near you.

, Most airlines will require that you submit an application with your basic information, a resume, and sometimes a cover letter. Make sure your application materials are clear and well-written, and stress your customer service experience.


It may be a matter of days or as long as several weeks before you receive a telephone call or an email from the airlines to whom you have submitted an application.
Most major airlines have only one city in the United States where they conduct interviews, so you may have to travel to your interviews. Know what makes each airline unique, and be prepared to discuss the qualities that make you right for this particular airline during your interview.

, Airlines are quite selective when it comes to hiring flight attendants; the right candidates must have a special mix of cool-headedness, endurance and the ability to provide excellent customer service. Show that you’re personable, responsible, and that you care about people’s safety and comfort. Be personable and don't forget to smile. Know that many airlines conduct the first interview via video submission. Many interviews consist of two parts:


In the first part, your customer service skills will be tested with a written examination.
If you pass, the second part of the interview will test whether you have good leadership skills. You'll be asked how you would handle different scenarios that could occur while working a shift in the air. For example, what would you do in an emergency if the aircraft started to descent? Or how would you handle a drunk passenger?
Use anecdotes to illustrate times when you handled a situation that required acting as a leader while others were anxious and stressed.

, If you’re hired for a position, you’ll have to undergo a medical exam before the airline makes it official. Find out what the exam will entail and make sure you’ll be able to pass it.

, Every airline has a slightly different system for training flight attendants. You may be required to take an online course as well as do field training on a plane. You'll receive training regarding how to handle an emergency landing and evacuate a plane as well as how to answer customers' questions and operate the drinks cart. Depending on the airline, you may also receive instruction on how to make announcements to passengers. You can take steps to prepare for this by learning your airport codes and understanding the 24 hour clock.


The four- to six-week training period is described by many as being difficult, but rewarding. Learn from your mistakes and always maintain a positive demeanor. Remember that every flight attendant started out as a rookie. You have a lot to learn, and a lot to look forward to.
It's essential that you pass the training period in order to move into full-time status as a flight attendant. If you do not pass, your contract will be revoked. You may reapply after six months to a year, depending on the airline policy.

Obey orders in a timely and certain fashion.,
Understand sea language.,
Know the functional elements of the vessel.,
Know your captain.,
Keep morale up.,
Run a tight ship.,
Communicate effectively with the crew.,
Stay in top shape.,
Observe the seas and weather for unusual events.,
Get to know all the hands on the boat personally.,
Make yourself available at all times, for both the captain and crew.",How to Be a Good First Mate," On a small sailing vessel, the crew may consist of only a captain and one or two hands, or persons charged with operating the boat. In this situation, the first mate acts as a hand in the craft's operation, but for larger vessels, the first mate is the second in command, and on shifts, may be the officer of the deck, or OD.;
, No first mate would hesitate to immediately set to a task when he is ordered to it by the skipper of the vessel.

, Here are some examples with their definitions:


The deck. This is the main level of the vessel, usually referring to the exterior area around the cabin (or superstructure of large ships).
The wheelhouse. This is the location, usually an interior area with windows and the wheel, which is used to steer the vessel.
Below decks. On small craft, this may simply be a cabin, the head (bathroom), the engine compartment, and whatever storage space is built into the boat. Larger vessels may include a galley, crew's and officer's quarters, a hold (for cargo), a bilge, and a variety of other specialized compartments.
Stern/aft. The rear of the vessel.
Port. The left side of the vessel.
Starboard. The right side of the vessel.
Forward, or any designation including the prefix for/fore designates the front of the vessel, such as foredeck, forecastle, etc.

, For a sailing ship, you should understand the nomenclature and purpose of the rigging, including all hardware, lines, spars, mast, sheets, and be able to tend them efficiently if the need should arise, for instance, the crew falls ill or someone is injured.

, This is a critical issue where the captain's ability and mental condition are suspect, of course, since the safety of the vessel and crew are dependent on a captain making good decisions in every circumstance, but knowing the captain also makes it possible for the first mate to anticipate orders, keep the ship and crew in pleasing form, and make life more pleasant for everyone in the cramped spaces of a ship or boat.

, On a long voyage, the first mate must help keep the crew cheerful and in good spirits. This means being an arbitrator in disputes, maintaining discipline, making sure everyone pulls their own weight, and keeping things running smoothly.

, Keep tackle and gear stored properly, make sure cargo and stores are secured, be aware of the condition of rigging or engines, know how much fuel, food and water are on hand, and make sure hatches are kept secured. Keeping the deck clear of debris and loose lines and tackle makes for a safer environment for everyone.

, When the captain gives an order, carry it out by giving accurate and concise instructions to the crewman responsible for completing the task. For particular tasks, it is advisable to attend to it or observe it being taken care of personally.

, Sea voyages are often boring and lacking in physical challenge on modern vessels, but when a crisis occurs, equipment fails, or severe weather is encountered, the first mate must be able to physically perform his duties without fail.

, Even with modern communications, satellite weather technology, and onboard radar, nothing can replace a pair of sharp eyes scanning the seas and skies for approaching squall lines or other vessels wandering into the path of your ship.

, Knowing each person will make the job of managing their efforts much easier, since personalities often dictate different management techniques to get optimum performance from the crew.

, This means being willing to take a midnight shift at the helm, talk about personal problems with a deckhand, or taking orders.

Take compass bearings regularly.",How to Anchor a Boat," A fluke or Danforth anchor relies less on its weight than on its design, which consists of two flat, pointed flukes extending at a 30º angle from the anchor rod. This is one of the more popular designs on the market, and in soft mud or hard sand, has more staying power by weight than any other type.However, its broad-fluked design may prevent it from reaching bottom in a strong current, and like most anchors, it will have trouble catching on rocks and other hard bottoms.


Aluminum variations of the Danforth design, such as the Fortress, have excellent holding power. Some of these also have adjustable flukes, which can be made broader when anchoring in soft mud.A large aluminum fluke anchor may make a good storm anchor.;
, The plow anchor is named for the plow-shaped wedge attached by a swivel to the shaft. It is effective in soft bottoms, and somewhat better in grass than other lightweight anchors.These tend to be heavier than fluke anchors of the same size, and thus will set more easily (though with somewhat less holding power) than fluke anchors.The ability of the shaft to swivel in the direction it is pulled without yanking the main anchor makes the plow anchor less likely to unfasten when the boat is pulled a different direction.


Plow anchors have no protruding flukes or pieces that the anchor line or chain can catch on. However, unless you have a bow roller, plow anchors can be difficult to store., Mushroom anchors look like a disc or dish at the base of the anchor shaft. They don't have much holding power, but are a good choice for small boats that make short stops in areas with soft ground. If your boat is small enough for the size of mushroom anchor you choose, it may be your best bet for heavily weeded areas. If poking a hole in your vessel is a concern, mushroom anchors have no sharp edges and are less likely to damage thin hulled boats such as composite canoes, kayaks and inflatables.Many electric anchors lowered by the push of a button are mushroom anchors.

, Many more types of anchor exist, and no single anchor is useful for every purpose. Grapnel, navy, or Herreshoff anchors are useful for anchoring small boats to rocky bottoms.Less common bottoms may require specialized anchors for best results, such as a claw anchor in gravel., Depending on what you use your boat for, you'll probably want several anchors of different sizes. Your main anchor is useful for extending fishing spots and most other purposes. An anchor one or two sizes smaller that's easy to deploy and pull up is good for lunch stops and other short breaks. A storm anchor one or two sizes larger should be kept around to deploy during rough weather or for overnight stops. In addition, it's always good to have at least one heavy backup in case you lose an anchor, or for situations where it's wise to use two anchors.


You should always follow the recommendations of your boat's manufacturer when picking anchor size. However, a rough chart can be found halfway down this page. Purchase a larger anchor than specified if you have an unusual amount of weight on your boat.
When in doubt, purchase a larger anchor. Physical size is a more important indicator than weight, although both are relevant., Anchors are important for your safety, and you should buy the best anchors you can afford. Inspect each anchor for rust, uneven or breaking welding lines, and other inconsistencies in the metal before purchasing.

, You may have a bow roller mounted on your boat where you can store and attach your anchor, but be aware that each roller is only suitable for specific types of anchors. Otherwise, make sure you have strong, sturdy deck cleats to tie the anchor rope onto., The chain, rope, or combination of these that attaches the anchor to your boat is called an anchor rode. Nylon's elasticity allows it to respond well to sudden wind and current changes, and a high quality rope is sufficiently strong to use as a rode. It is also easy to manipulate and relatively cheap, although you should not skimp on quality.


Three stranded nylon rope is most resistant to tears and thus best suited for water bottom purposes, but it will become difficult to handle and need to be replaced after it is stiff with salt. Choose medium lay three stranded rope, referring to the number of twists in the strands, as it will come apart less easily.Braided nylon rope is stronger and easier to work with, but not a great option for frequent anchor use, as it snags or tears from objects on the bottom., Chain is more expensive and takes more effort to use, but won't be fouled by strong currents and helps the anchor drop to the bottom quickly. Try to find anchor chain with high quality of manufacture and consistent galvanization, indicated by a uniform appearance. Good choices for chain types to use in anchor applications include BBB, Hi-test chain, and proof coil.Make sure the chain's links fit on your boat's windlass, which stores the chain and releases it as you drop the anchor.


Proof coil chain has a ""G 3"" imprinted on each link.
BBB chain is a strong material with small links suitable for small windlasses. It is preferred by people who use all-chain anchor ropes rather than a mix of rope and chain.
Hi-test chain is strong but light. Use it instead of the others if you'd like to reduce weight.
Anchor chain made by North American companies is a more consistent quality than some anchor chains of other countries.If you live elsewhere in the world and don't wish to buy an imported chain, local sailors or fishermen may be able to advise you.

, An anchor rode formed from lengths of both rope and chain provides some of the benefits and downsides of each, but requires an additional shackle joint to keep the two lengths tightly fastened.In the end, the chain vs. rope discussion has many factors involved, and you may want an experienced boat owner to help you make the decision.


If you use an all-chain rode, it is still a good idea to attach a nylon rope ""snubbing line"" to make the rode heavier and more elastic. One end of this rope is tied to a bow cleat, while a special chain hook tool attaches the other to the chain 4 feet (1.2m) or more from where the chain is attached to the bow., Nylon rope should be 3/16"" (4.8mm) in diameter for a craft under 10' (3m) in length and 3/8"" (9.5mm) for a craft under 20' (6m). Increase the diameter by an additional 1/8"" (3.2mm) for each additional 10' (3m) in length beyond 20 feet (6 meters).Chain can be 1/8"" (3.2mm) smaller in diameter than rope would be for that size of boat.

, Your charts should tell you the depth of the water and note any designated anchoring locations.Try to find a location with a flat bottom suitable for your anchor type (soft and relatively weed-free is usually best). Avoid areas of strong current or areas open to the weather, especially during an overnight stop.


If you're aiming to end up over a fishing spot or other specific area, keep in mind the anchor location should be well upwind of the area your boat will end up.

, Measure the depth of the chosen spot and multiply by 7: this is roughly how far your boat will drift from your anchor.If the current or wind changes, your boat could swing to the other side of the anchor; make sure it has sufficient space in every direction. Never anchor your boat somewhere where its swing radius will intersect another boat's.


Never assume the other boats have the same anchor line (or ""anchor rode"") length as you do, or that they will drift in the same direction. Ask other boat owners where their anchors are dropped and how long the rode is if you're not sure.
The instructions below give you more exact instructions for determining the length of your anchor line.

, Circle the spot you've chosen fully, taking depth measurements. This will reveal any hidden shoals or other obstructions that could damage your boat if it drifts while anchored.If you do find dangerous shallow areas, you'll need to find another place to drop anchor.

, You should know the timing of the next tide and the range of water level between high tide and low tide, so you aren't caught unawares. If you're staying longer than an hour or two, you should check the weather forecast so you're prepared for any high wind or storms., You should now have a good idea of the nature of your location. If you expect high winds or a strong tide, or if your anchor coming loose could cause a collision, you should use a heavy storm anchor with excellent holding power. For most situations, your ordinary main anchor or light ""lunch anchor"" will do.


See Selecting an Anchor for more information.
In rough circumstances, you may need to use one anchor at the bow and a second anchor at the stern. Only do this if nearby boats are using this method, as boats using one or two anchors swing by different amounts and easily foul each other's lines., When you stop, the current or wind should push you slowly backward away from the spot. This is when you should drop the anchor.If the water is calm, you may need a helmsman to reverse the engines at idle speed. It's better to work out hand signals for ""start"", ""stop"", ""more power"", and ""less power"" in advance, rather than attempting to shout across the boat., Before you drop your anchor, determine how much you'll line, or rode, you'll need, then use a cleat hitch to tie it at that distance. The term scope refers to the ratio between the length of your rode and the distance from the bow to the bottom. A good rule of thumb is a scope of at least 7:1 for a rope rode, or 5:1 for a heavier all-chain rode. Increase the scope to 10:1 or more for stormy conditions or if your anchor keeps ripping free of the bottom. The longer the scope, the closer to horizontal your rode is, and the more tightly you will be anchored.Measure from the bow, not the water surface. If the water is 10 feet deep (3m), and your bow is 4 feet (1.2) m above the water surface, the total depth is 14 feet (4.2m). A typical scope of 7:1 would require 14 x 7 = 98 feet of rode (4.2 x 7 = 29.4 m).
Consult a knot guide for sailors or online tutorial if you do not know how to tie a firm cleat hitch.
Only use a shorter scope than listed if you need to avoid drifting into obstacles and cannot find any suitable anchorage spot with more space. Do not rely on a short scope for rough weather or overnight stays.

, Keep the anchor rode tight at first to help you aim the anchor until you feel it hit bottom. Then slowly play out the rode at the same speed as the boat is moving. It should end up in a straight line across the bottom, not piled up in a heap that could get tangled.


Be careful to avoid getting your hands or feet caught in the rode, which could cause serious injury. Instruct passengers of the danger and keep kids and animals away.
Don't throw your anchor overboard; let it down slowly to avoid fouling your own rope.Never drop an anchor from the stern unless there is already an anchor holding the bow and you need extra anchorage. Anchoring from the stern only could cause your boat to capsize.

, Your boat will probably turn across the current or wind as you move. After you've let out about 1/3 of the total rode you determined you'd use, cinch it off and wait for the boat to straighten out. This will straighten the rode you've let out and gently set the anchor into the bottom.If your boat won't straighten out, your anchor is drifting and you need to try again. Pick another spot if possible.

, Uncinch the anchor rode and let it out as the boat once again drifts backward. Cinch it again once a total of 2/3 the rode length has been played out. Let the boat's momentum straighten it out and set the anchor more firmly. Repeat this process one more time, letting out the rest of the rode length you determined was necessary.

, Tie the anchor rode firmly around a bow cleat. Give it a tug to test the anchor is set, although be aware it will require further setting as described below. If not, you'll need to repeat this process. Try to find a different spot with better conditions.

, First, find two stationary objects on the shore, and note their positions relative to each other from your perspective. (For instance, a tree in front of a lighthouse, or two boulders a thumb's width apart if you hold your hand at arm's length.) Signal the helmsman to gently start the engine in reverse until the rode straightens, then signal him or her to return to neutral. The boat should drift back to a stationary position where the two objects you noted appear in exactly the same position relative to each other.If the two objects are in different positions and you remained standing in the same spot throughout this procedure, you are not anchored and need to begin again.
Try to arrange hand signals with your helmsman in advance, rather than attempting to shout across the boat.

, This is called snubbing the anchor, and jams a set anchor more firmly into the bottom. Have your helmsman reverse hard until the rode straightens out, then kill the engine.


Check your bearings again as your helmsman does this, to double check the anchor hasn't pulled free.

, Take the bearings of several objects around you and note them in your log book. Do this immediately after anchoring, and 15–20 minutes after anchoring to make sure the anchor set properly.Keep checking every hour or few hours, depending on how long you'll be anchored.


GPS units often have an alarm setting that will alert you if you drift.If you are going to be staying overnight, try to find at least one object that will be lit. If you can't, you should use a GPS unit.
For an overnight stay or other long stop, arrange an anchor watch rotation in advance so the crew can take turns checking to make sure you haven't drifted.

Select a laptop that has the ability to do what you need.,
Avoid a heavy laptop.,
Choose one with an anti-glare screen.,
Ensure that it is wi-fi enabled.,
Get some accessories.,
Consider the software capabilities.",How to Use a Laptop on a Sailboat1," If you only want to check the weather and send emails, a less powerful laptop will suffice but if you're wanting to keep databases, use maps, play games, and navigate with it, you need a powerful laptop. If you're using the laptop for serious work, find one that has a high processing speed, with a minimum of 1.5GHz so that you can run multiple programs without slowing down. In addition, get one with at least 2 GB of memory (RAM) so that the operating system works fast and smoothly and so you can store charts, photos, videos, etc., without slowing things down. A hard drive with at least 160GB is essential., Look for a lightweight one that is easy to move around and small enough to be placed on small surfaces (common in a sailboat). However, check that there are adequate USB ports for the many plug-ins/peripherals you might have. There are a lot of items that can transfer information direct to the laptop via a USB port now, such as wind and other data instruments, satellite radio, etc.

, Since you'll be out on the waters with plenty of sun glare and water glare, this is a necessity, not a luxury.

, Most new laptops are nowadays but older (reconditioned) ones might not be. Wi-fi will be very handy for connecting to the internet when docked or near internet broadcasting. You might even consider getting satellite internet access using a satellite phone because even the latest networks require you to be close to shore to pick up the internet. Bluetooth is helpful for transferring information between your cell phone and/or GPS receiver and laptop too.

, Having an external keyboard and mouse can be a handy addition to enable you to sit away from the laptop in a more comfortable position that doesn't cause back, neck, and arm strain over long periods of time. If the laptop doesn't have an in-built camera, consider getting one to attach to it for those Skype talk and video. And do you want speakers for music or will the ones already in the laptop be sufficient? And a laptop lamp might come in handy when it's too dark to see as others sleep.

, You should know what you want in terms of software before buying the laptop. That way, you can make sure that it is compatible with your laptop and will work the way you want. For example, Macs have specific navigation software that you might wish to use, meaning that you need to err on the side of buying a Mac."

Consider creating a space for the laptop.,
When not in use, find a suitable storage spot for the laptop.",How to Use a Laptop on a Sailboat3," Naturally, given the portability of a laptop, you can probably sit just about anywhere and use it but it might not be comfortable or practical having it on your lap all the time. Is there a suitable space where the laptop can stay most of the time? Is this space likely to be safe or do you need to make modifications to ensure that the laptop won't slide off in heavy seas? Laptops can be banged around and easily dropped if the seas get rough and this won't do the laptop any good. Be prepared to ensure that it is kept safe.

, If you can't see a naturally suitable spot already on the sailboat, consider making one. A simple fold-down table with wooden barriers built around the sides of it could work well as a quick-to-build solution for where to place the laptop.

, One good solution is to get a lined/padded aluminum waterproof/ water resistant case or bag that can be slipped under a bunk, into a storage cupboard, etc., and will keep the laptop safe when not in use. And see the moisture-safety steps below, such as adding a desiccant and it's prudent to use a dry-bag around the case or bag for added protection; a dry-bag can ensure that the laptop remains dry should it fall overboard unexpectedly when moving cargo, leaving at port, etc.

"

Purchase a drawstring plastic bag.,
Obtain a drying agent.,
Prepare the laptop for de-humidifying.,
Use the laptop as usual onboard without concern.,
When the desiccant changes its color or has absorbed all that it can, replace it right away.",How to Use a Laptop on a Sailboat4," Its thickness should be at least 0.10 mm (0.0039 of an inch).

, While calcium oxide is usually used on sailboats for de-humidification, this chemical can go hard on your laptop. Instead, get some silica gel desiccant. Better yet, get a drying agent with a safe organic indicator which changes its color from orange when active to green when saturated. This makes it much easier to know when your laptop has had all the humidity removed from its inner workings.

, Turn the laptop off. Place in into the plastic bag together with enough desiccant. Leave it like this when not the laptop is not in use. This includes when docked at port because your laptop is still over water.


The desiccant usually comes in small paper bags. It is really important the the desiccant does not come into direct contact with the laptop, so if it is not already covered in a bag, add one before placing it in with the laptop.

, While the laptop is on, humidity is not a problem as moisture accumulates only on surfaces that are at lower temperature than the ambient air is. It is only when it is not being used that moisture becomes a problem.

, Calculate the amount you'll need to bring with you for the duration of your sailing trip.

Do regular back-ups of your information.,
Get into the habit of making nightly or weekly backups (whatever fits your needs).",How to Use a Laptop on a Sailboat5," Things happen at sea and the laptop could stop working, fall overboard, get dropped one too many times, etc. Ensure that your precious information has been backed up and kept elsewhere and not just on the laptop. You could use cloud computing methods, email your information, or use a hardy external drive kept safely somewhere else onboard.

, Use a calendar or a phone reminder if needed.

Prevent oily discharges from the bilge.,
Spill-proof your oil changes by using an oil change pump to transfer oil to a spill-proof container.,
When fueling, prevent fuel spills by filling fuel tanks slowly and catching drips and spills with absorbent pads or rags.,
Do not add soap.,
Save boat cleaning and maintenance projects for the boatyard whenever possible.,
Reduce toxic discharges from bottom paints by using a less toxic, or nontoxic anti- fouling paint.,
Dispose of hazardous waste at a hazardous waste collection facility or event.,
Plan ahead.,
Keep your trash on board.,
Reduce grey water pollution and its impact on the marine environment by using a phosphate-free biodegradable soap.,
Sail.",How to Boat Green," Keep your engine well tuned to prevent fuel and oil leaks. Place an oil absorbent pad in your bilge and under your engine where drips may occur. Check the pads often; don’t let them clog the bilge pump, and dispose of them as hazardous waste at a marina or local hazardous waste collection center.;
, Wrap a plastic bag or absorbent pad around the oil filter to stop oil from spilling into the bilge.

, Don’t ""top off"" or overflow your fuel tank. Leave the tank ten percent empty to allow fuel to expand as it warms.

, Never use soap to disperse fuel and oil spills. It’s illegal and it increases harm to the environment.

, If you must work on the water, minimize your impact by containing waste. Use tarps and vacuum sanders to collect all drips and debris for proper disposal.

, Use non-abrasive underwater hull cleaning techniques to prevent excessive paint discharge. Remember, dry storage reduces the need for antifouling paints and saves money.

, This includes paints, batteries, antifreeze, cleaning products, oil and oil filters.

, Manage sewage wastes properly. Never discharge sewage within 3 miles (4.8 km) of shore. Use harbor pump-out stations and shore-side facilities. If you don’t have an installed toilet, use a port-a-potty and empty it at a harbor dump station or bathroom.

, Never throw cigarette butts, fishing line, or any other garbage into the ocean. Recycle plastic, glass, metal, and paper at shore-side facilities.

, Do dishes and showers on shore whenever possible. (Grey water is the soapy water used in boat maintenance.)

, Wind is a freely renewable and sustainable resource.

Understand the basics about yachts.,
Learn the yacht steering controls.,
Leave the dock.,
Learn about cruising.,
Return to the dock.",How to Solo Drive a 100 Foot Power Yacht," Before you actually attempt to drive the yacht, sit in the cabin a few days and practice operating the marine radio and other communications and safety equipment.


Learn the proper radio frequencies for emergencies:

The International Distress frequency is 156.80Mhz
Coast Guard and Harbor Patrol 157.10Mhz
Ship to ship (calling frequency) 156.45Mhz
Ship to shore 156.70Mhz
Marine Operator (to make a phone call) 157.20Mhz.


These are just a few channels.— Check your area for the preferred channels in use. Your VHF radio has a range of more than 30 miles (48 km) and a cell phone won't help much at sea.
Apply to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for your operator's license, so you can operate the radios legally.
If you have more interest in ship radio try this, the website for the Commercial Radio Operator License Program. Read about who needs what kind of license, and find information on obtaining the licenses.
Anyone who operates a boat needs to receive their ""Boating Safety I.D. Card and Certificate."" This can be done by taking a class from the U.S. Coastguard's list of safety courses and passing the final exam.;
, Most will have a steering wheel and two throttles. These controls are required for sufficient steering of the boat. The steering wheel will not do a good job of steering at slow speeds in a tight harbor. The engines do most of the steering at slow speeds. The engines alone can steer your boat. For example, to make a right turn around in a tight area, advance the left throttle slowly while retarding the right throttle the same amount. This is called differential steering. If you do this properly you will make the turn without ever moving the boat forward or backward. Of course you will have to practice this for a long time to perfect it.

In a car, you can idle the engine and hold the brake to stop. In a boat, you are always at the mercy of the wind and tide. The only way to hold your position is with differential steering with the engines at all times.
Don't say left or right in a boat. The terms for the four directions are port, starboard, forward and aft.

, Think about your limits and don’t try to drive away in a yacht without the required crew members. Depending on the size of the yacht, it may require no crew members or several crew members. A 100 foot (30.5 m) yacht can be driven alone with the help of a dock hand to untie the yacht from the dock and also help when you return to the dock., When you think you can control the boat, try cruising in a straight line.

Use partial throttle, equally on both engines, to cruise forward in a straight line.
Use the steering wheel while cruising for directional control.
If something gets in your way just reduce the throttles to slow down.
If you need to stop quicker, reverse both engines equally just enough to stop forward motion. This is where you may need to go to differential engines to hold position.

, Docking is the most difficult to master, and the most dangerous. A lot of damage will result if you do this wrong. Try to practice docking in a calm wind first. If you're docking on the port side, try using the starboard engine forward and aft and repeat this maneuver. The boat should ease to port side slowly. This is where you really need a dock crew, especially in a little wind. Some yachts have side thrusters to help move the boat sideways. This will make docking a lot smoother."

Research before you donate.",How to Donate a Boat to Charity1," There are a number of sites that offer charitable deductions for your boat, but check to see if they are legitimate before you give away your boat:


See if the organization has 501(c) status with the IRS.Look up the status of the organization on the nonprofit list of the Better Business Bureau.Consult Charity Navigator.Remember, due to the Separation of Church and State, churches and religious organizations are exempt from applying for nonprofit status. Donations made to these organizations are still considered tax deductible, and as an added benefit, they are 50% organizations which means that you will be allowed to deduct up to 50% of your AGI. If you cannot find a specific charity in the IRS database, consult the charity to determine whether they fall into this category.;

, In addition to passing the licensing exam, individuals need to be able to receive and send spoken messages in English. Additionally, they must be a legal resident of the United States or legally eligible for employment in the country.Once the license is obtained, it is good for life and does not need to be renewed.

, To obtain a PG or GROL license, you must first pass a written exam comprising two elements.


Element 1 of the exam includes questions about basic radio law and operating practice for maritime radio operators. The exam comprises 24 questions, and passing requires answering at least 18 of them correctly.Element 3 of the written exam contains 100 questions, of which at least 75 must be answered correctly. This exam focuses on general radiotelephone information, such as the electronic fundamentals of the equipment and techniques for adjusting, repairing and maintaining it. Some of the categories for this exam include operating procedures, radio wave propagation, radio practice, electrical principles, circuit components, practical circuits, signals and emissions, and antennas and feed lines.If you have decided to also obtain the radar endorsement for working on marine vessels, you will have to pass Element 8, Ship Radar Techniques.
Element 8 contains 50 questions, of which 38 must be answered correctly in order to pass. The questions focus on theory and practice of using radar for marine navigation purposes.

Completely remove any items you don't want painted, such as the bottom bracket or forks.,
Degrease the bike.,
Remove all of the existing paint with medium-grade sandpaper or rough sponge (80 grit) to form a smooth surface.,
Hang the bike by the head tube to ensure that your paint does not clog up at the bottom bracket.,
Apply a primer with very thin coats to provide the best finish.,
Allow the frame to dry for about 24 hours.,
Sand the primer using 220-grit paper/sponge.,
Put on your main coat of paint.,
Sand it down again after the paint dries, this time using some wet-or-dry 1200-grit paper.,
Put stickers or decals on your bike (optional).,
Apply the clear lacquer in the same way as you painted the bike; however, this time you may only need to put on 2 or 3 coats.,
Complete the repainting of your bike by following the steps for the frame with the forks or any other part.,
Finished.

",How to Paint a Bike," Areas of the frame with threads for bolts can either be covered with painter's tape, or the bolts can be put in, (you don't want paint preventing you from putting it back together).


Be careful when taking the bike apart. The headset area (where the handle bars and forks attach to the frame) are quite complicated. You should definitely take notes and pictures of how the parts were aligned when you take them out, so that you can get them back in correctly. The cups that are pressed into the frame should be removed to properly paint the bike. Removal without deforming them is difficult without the proper tools. Consider taking your frame to a bicycle shop for this final step of the break down. They should be able to remove them on the spot for free, or very cheap.
Also, buy some bicycle-specific grease and use your hand to apply to the bearings and internal mechanisms; this will ensure smooth operation and protect these parts from wear.;
, You can use bike degreaser or car body wipe.

, See Tips for other options.


If you are lucky enough to have a carbon frame, make sure that you do not sand the carbon. You may have to leave some of the paint in place.
If there are any dents or wear marks which you want to fill in, this is the time to do it. You can use knifing putty, or something similar to produce a smooth surface. Make sure that you sand it down well afterwards, and remove the dust.

, A coat hanger works great. Hang it in an area that you have good access to (a clothes line is perfect,) as you will need to be able to move around the whole bike and underneath it, too. Also, make sure you hang your bike in a well ventilated area, with good light to help check that you have applied an even coat.

, Follow the instructions on the can (typically spray about 20cm from the surface). Start at the joints and bottom bracket in the frame. These are the hardest bits to paint, and the easiest places to get runs or miss a spot. Wait about 15 minutes between coats, and don't worry about it if you don't fully cover the frame in the first or second coat, because you will be applying several coats.


Make sure you buy the right type of primer, as the colour of the primer depends on what your final colour will be. Also, look for a primer that resists rust or a rust converter, (rust inhibitor).
If you are refurbishing an aluminium frame, you may need to get a special primer or an thalidomide coating, which ensures that the pores in the aluminium do not affect the finish.
When priming the bike, especially if you are outside, wear goggles and a mouth mask. It is not a nice feeling to have paint fly into your eyes whenever a gust of wind comes. Also wear gloves, because some paints strip your skin.

, Try to let it dry in the place you painted it. If this is not possible, lay it carefully on newspapers, and try not to touch it, since the paint is easily damaged.

, Your aim is to achieve a smooth surface which the next layer of paint can adhere to.

, Once again, make sure your bike is clean of dust and any grease. To apply the color, follow the same steps as you did for the primer, ensuring you apply thin coats until you have a uniform finish. If you wish to paint the frame in multiple colours, you simply apply the lighter paint first, applying till an even coat is achieved (3 or 4 coats), then mask over the area you wish to remain the light colour, and paint the darker colour on.

, When sanding with the 1200-grit sandpaper, make sure to ""wet-sand"" the finish. This keeps the sandpaper from ""loading"". Wet-sand by taking some Windex, and spraying the Windex onto the paint, and then sand. Make sure you keep the finish ""wet"" while you're sanding. All you are trying to do is to take the gloss off the paint producing a matte finish for the lacquer to stick to. The lacquer will make the paint shiny again.

, The lacquer you put on afterward will protect the stickers; however, unless you have very thin stickers, it is unlikely you will get a completely smooth surface. If you want to buy decals, have a look online, as there are many replica decals for major bike manufacturers.

, It is important, especially at this stage, that you do not have the spray can too far from the surface as you could end up with a rough surface.

, Allow the lacquer to harden for at least a week before putting the bike together, or you may damage your beautiful new paint job.

Do not take risks to recover the bike yourself.",How to Lock Your Bike," If your bike has a quick-release front wheel, remove it and place it next to the rear wheel for locking.


If you can't remove your front wheel, or your U lock is not large enough to encompass both wheels, secure the rear wheel then continue reading for alternatives.;
, Using a ""D"" or ""U"" lock, secure the back end of your bike to another object. Place the ""U"" section of your lock around the rim of your rear wheel, your unattached front wheel, your rear frame, and the immovable object, then attach the straight bar to ends of the ""U"" to lock it.


See Using Decent Locks for advice on U locks, and Selecting a Lock Location for how to select an object to secure your bike to.
If your U lock is too small to fit around every object, use it on just the rear wheel and stationary object but place it ""inside"" the triangle made by the three rear sections of the bike's frame. This makes it impossible to pull the frame away from the wheel.This is usually enough to deter a thief, since he would have to destroy the valuable rear wheel to take the bike.

Do not attach your U-lock to the crossbar (or ""top tube"") of the bike. This is the horizontal or down-sloping bar between the seat and the handlebars. This makes it easy for thieves to use the bike frame as leverage to attempt to break the lock., The front wheel is less valuable than the rear,but some level of security should still be used or even an opportunistic passerby could steal the wheel.


You can loop a cable lock around the front wheel and the bike frame, and optionally around the rear wheel as well if the cable is long enough. Lock the cable together using its built in lock or a padlock.
For greater security, use a second U-lock instead to secure the front wheel to its frame.

, Bags, baskets, lights, reflectors, bells, and anything else that can be removed should be taken with you or secured with their own cable lock.

, Use a D lock on rear wheel, through frame and an immovable object. Secure the front wheel using one end of the cable by pushing it through. Push a loop of the cable through the rails of your saddle; secure by passing the free end of the cable through the loop. Secure the free end in the D lock.

, Cheap locks can easily be cut open, especially ones from 99p or dollar stores and some underground sports shops. (And thieves know the difference.) You can find better locks at a bike shop or a general sporting goods store.

, Using at least two good quality locks of different types (listed below) will deter thieves that only have the tools to deal with one type, or who don't want to deal with the extra hassle., The smaller the U-lock, the harder it will be for a thief to lever it open with a jack or other tool.


For best security, pick a U-lock that is just barely large enough to fit over your rear wheel, frame, and the object you're locking the bike to.While the space inside the U lock should be as small as possible, the U lock material itself should be thick and strong.

, Sufficiently thick chains (ideally 15mm links or more) are an excellent thief deterrent. On the other hand, they are much heavier than other options.Chains are usually secured by a padlock, which can be the weakest link. Use as thick a padlock as possible to resist bolt cutter attacks.
A short chain for locking one wheel of your bike to an object will be much lighter to carry around than a chain long enough for both wheels. In this case, you will need an additional lock (which is a good practice to adopt anyway).

, You can purchase a thick (20mm) cable lock that is somewhat harder to cut, but the best course of action is to use cable locks as additional thief deterrent, not stand alone security.Cable locks can also be used to secure less valuable bike attachments to the frame, such as a basket.

, When possible, avoid leaving your bike in areas with high incidents of bike theft. Your local bike shop or police department should know where the most bike theft occurs., People hanging around near a bike rack may be there to steal bikes or to tip off a bike thief as soon as you leave., Thieves know where commuters typically leave their bikes unattended for a full workday, and will be more confident about spending a long time to steal a bike., The more pedestrians there are, and the easier they can see your bike, the harder it is for a thief to unobtrusively break your locks.


If possible, place your bike in view of a nearby building's video surveillance camera. Even if this fails to deter a thief, you may be able to obtain footage of the theft to aid in recovery.

, Don't assume that every bike rack is a safe option. Use an object with these attributes when locking your bike:Thick and sturdy. Don't select a wooden fence or thin steel object that can quickly be cut apart.

Hard to disassemble. Check metal racks or railings for bolts; these can be removed by a dedicated thief.

Firmly fastened to the ground. A strong thief or a team of thieves could simply pick up and remove a heavy object with the bike attached. Shake signposts to test whether they are anchored firmly to the pavement.

Impossible to lift the bike over. A tall thief could simply lift your bike over the top of the object and take it home to remove the lock in private. Try to use something that is attached to the ground in two places, such as a sturdy bike rack, since a very dedicated thief could use a rope to hoist your bike even over a relatively tall object., The bikes at the end of a row of bikes are most visible to thieves but also the easiest for them to work on unobtrusively.Make sure you don't lock your bike to another bike with a careless cable lock.

, Many bikes have quick release wheels and saddles, which can be removed with a touch of the right tool. Many bike thieves are happy to walk away with just a seat and wheels, or with a bike missing a wheel if you didn't lock the frame.


Locking skewers, available at bike stores or online, require a unique handle or key to remove (or at least additional effort by the thief). Simply remove the quick release skewers as normal and insert the more secure skewers in the same slot.
Some cheaper skewers attach to the bike with a hex nut instead. These are still removed with a common tool (hex key or Allen key), but deter casual opportunists.
Never leave the means to remove the skewer next to an unattended bike.

, If you don't use locking skewers or desire additional security, you can use a length of chain to tie your seat to the frame:


Wrap a long length of bicycle chain with electrical tape. This will prevent it from scratching your bike.
Wrap the chain around the chain stays of the bike (the small bar of the frame parallel to the bike's chain). Then bring it up through the metal saddle rails that hold your saddle on the seat post. Secure the chain by clamping the chain together with pliers.

, It's harder to sell an easily identified bike. Use a marker to write your name or initials twice on each tire (on opposite points of the circumference), and/or onto the top of the frame.If writing your name on the frame, protect it with several layer of clear tape. This isn't too hard for a thief to remove, but every deterrent helps the thief move on to search for an easier target.

, Before you enter a high-crime area, disguise your fancy new bike by wrapping easy to remove electrical tape around parts of the frame, seat, and handlebars.(This makes it look like you're repairing or hiding damage.)


If you have a fancy, expensive bike seat, carry it inside instead of leaving it on the bike. You could also replace it with a secondhand seat when you're using your bike for commuting or routine errands.

, An easy way to accomplish this is to take a photograph of yourself at home next to your bike, holding a piece of paper with the bike's serial number written on it.Most serial numbers are located where the two pedal cranks meet. Other common locations include the headset (beneath the handlebars) and the rear stays (the bars parallel to the bike chain).Ask a friend or someone at your local bike shop for help if you cannot locate it.

, Register your bike for free with Bike Shepherd or a different database to obtain unique scanning stickers for your bike, send out theft alerts, and similar benefits

, For especially valuable or sentimental bikes, spend the extra money on a GPS tracker designed to attach securely to your bike. This will allow you or the police to track the bike's location in case of theft.

, Have the bike's serial number ready to give them if you know it. You can do this online, but showing up in person at the nearest police station may lead to a faster response.Let the police know about your GPS tracker if one is attached to your bike.

, There are many websites that keep a local or global registry of stolen bikes. You can enter information about your theft on these for free.
, Let your friends know that your bike is stolen, post about it on social media, and tell people who spend time near where it was stolen (such as the employees at the business you locked your bike in front of). The more people who know your bike was missing, the greater the chance someone will see it and tell you.


Be sure to provide your contact information and a detailed description of your bicycle.

, Craigslist and other online noticeboards often have sections for announcing stolen bikes. If you receive information, pass it on to police.

, Return to the spot your bike was stolen and look at nearby buildings for video cameras. If you see any, ask the owners if you or the police can review their tapes to help identify the bike thief.

, eBay, Gumtree, and Craigslist are all common places for bike thieves to sell bikes. Check regularly for bikes of the model that was stolen for bikes that might be yours. If you find a likely candidate, notify the police and the website owners.


The easiest way to do this is to set up an automatic alert on each site that will send you an email every time a bike of a certain model is put up for sale. The process varies for each website; search the FAQ or ask customer service about ""automatic alerts"", ""auto-search"", or ""saved searches"".

, Find out where used bikes are commonly sold in your area and visit them. If you see your bike there, make sure it's yours and contact the police.

, Bicycle theft is covered under some plans, but you'll need to submit the claim within a certain time period following the theft.If you used a high-security lock, contact the manufacturers and see if they have an anti-theft guarantee.

, Once you've located your bike, let the police recover it rather than risking injury to do so yourself.

Get some good, flat, open wrenches.,

Grab the axle on the side that is still locked in place and point the end that you've just loosened, up.,
Re-grease.,
Reassemble.",How to Grease Bicycle Wheel Bearings," Make sure they are in sizes 13mm and 15mm. Those are the most common sizes. No other size wrench will work, but any type of adjustable wrench will do for the locking nut.;
, Put the adjustable wrench on the locking nut. Hold the bearing cone in place and unscrew the locking nut. The best position to do this is hunched over the wheel while it sits on the ground. Whatever you do,do not open the cones at all while in this position. Just unlock it so you can unscrew everything with your fingers later.


Some hubs requires thin wrenches for this step, due to limited space between the locking nut and the cassette housing for example.

, Now it is time to unscrew the locking nut almost completely off the axle. Next, unscrew the bearing cone to expose the wheel bearings to the light of day. Any grease in there?

, The fast way to re-grease your bearings is by just shooting grease in the bearings, screwing the cone back in, flipping the wheel over, hold the cone of the bearing you've just greased, grab the axle now facing up, unscrew it to reveal the other side's bearings and pack them with grease. But the proper way is by taking everything off, clean all the cones, hub cups, bearings, and repack with grease.

, Screw the bearing cone back into place, but not too tight. Bearings should be able to roll smoothly without axle play. Tighten the lock nut into place and check again.

When your foot is at the lowest point while pedaling, you want your knee to be slightly bent, not locked out completely straight or curved.


Your knee should be bent roughly 25 degrees. This feels similar to standing upright in an athletic position-- just a slight bend is enough.If you do not have access to measuring tape, use this as your guideline for adjusting the seat height by hand: knee slightly bent, hips square while riding, and comfortable ability to pedal.;
, This is the distance from your crotch to the floor measured down the inside of your leg. To get an accurate inseam reading:


Hold the spine of a hardcover book under your crotch, mimicking the feeling of a seat.
Stand with your feet 6"" apart.
Measure from the spine of the book to the floor. This is your inseam.Multiply your inseam by 1.09. The resulting number will be the distance in inches that should be measured between the top of your bike seat and the axle of your pedals. For example: an inseam of 29 inches (73.7 cm), multiplied by 1.09 equals 31.6 inches (80.3 cm). So the top of your seat and the axle point of your pedals should be 31.6 inches (80.3 cm) apart. (This measurement can also be calculated with centimeters)., All seat posts are are loosened and adjusted at the junction where the seat post meets the bike frame. A quick-release lever at the base of the seat post can be pried opened and adjusted by hand. If there is a small bracket with a screw in it, you have a bolted seat post: use an Allen key or adjustable wrench to loosen the bolt just enough to move the seat post.








, Gently slide the seat post up or down to reach your ideal measurement. It can help to nick the post at the right height, so you can find this adjustment again if the seat slips or someone borrows the bike.








, Either press the quick-release lever back down to its locked position, or re-tighten the bolts with your Allen key or adjustable wrench until there is no movement. You do not need to get it so tight that you can't undo it later. Basic hand tightness will be enough.








, Head out into the driveway and go for a slow test ride. Make sure you can easily reach the pedals and get onto the bike, and you knees are not locked. Try standing while you pedal to make sure you can comfortably get out of the saddle. Make sure that the seat is facing straight ahead or your riding position will be awkward and uncomfortable.









Place the ball of your foot on the pedal when you ride. There should now be a slight bend (25 degrees) in your knee when the pedal is at its lowest point. This is your optimal seat height.
If you have clip pedals or cages, make sure you use them on your test ride -- they will affect your ride.
Everyone has a different body type -- your inseam measurement should be used as a starting point. You should then adjust the bike to fit you comfortably., If you have knee pain, the biggest cause is usually your seat height. Depending on what the pain is, you likely have different problems. However, if the pain does not go away with seat adjustments you should see a doctor.









If the pain is on the back of your knee, the seat is too high.

If the pain is on the front of your knee, the seat is too low.Your hips should be sturdy, not rocking, while you pedal. If you slide your hips to each side with your pedal strokes, your seat is too high.

Prepare a travel bag containing all of the tools and equipment necessary to replace a blown inner tube.,
Detach the wheel with the blown inner tube using a wrench or your wheel’s quick release lever.,
Remove the tire from the rim once the wheel is detached from the bike using a tire lever.,
Once the tire is off, the inner tube is easily removed from the interior from the tire.

,
Partially inflate the new inner tube just enough that the tube forms a circular shape.,
Push the tire back into the rim, being sure to match the valve of the inner tube with the valve hole cut into the rim.,
Reattach the wheel by tightening the nuts on the axle and ensuring that the wheel is secured to the frame.

",How to Replace a Blown Bike Tire Inner Tube," In order to assemble this bag, you must determine several things:


The size of inner tube that the tire requires. This is often printed on the side of the inner tube or on the side of the tire itself. If you cannot find the size of the inner tube, consult your owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website.
The type of valve your tube uses. This is either a Schrader valve or a Presta valve. Schrader valves are found on less expensive or older bikes, while Presta valves are often found on high end racing bikes. A Schrader valve is wider, and looks like the valve found on a car tire, while the Presta valve is much skinnier. The easiest way to determine what valve your inner tube uses is to consult your owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website. If you cannot find this information, ask a local bike shop employee.

This information is critical in selecting the bike pump you will bring, because if the valve of the pump does not correspond to the valve of the tire, it will be impossible to inflate the inner tube.


The size of wrench that is used to loosen the 4 nuts that hold your bicycle wheel’s axle in the frame. The measurements of these nuts can be found in the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website. If you cannot find this information, a simple solution is to test out wrenches on the bolt until you find a wrench that is a snug fit to the nut.

It is recommended that you bring a set of wrenches, ensuring you will have the right tools for the job.
Make sure that if your bike uses metric nuts, you bring a metric set of wrenches and vice versa.
A wrench is not necessary if both wheels are equipped with quick release levers.

;
, This is done easiest with the bike resting upside down, balanced on the seat and the handlebars.

, This is done by pushing the narrow end of the tire lever between the tire and the rim, and then using the lever to lift the edge of the tire over the rim.


Caution: Be sure to remove the dust cover from the valve stem, and use extra care when removing the valve stem from the rim.

,, This makes it easier to fit the tube into the tire.

, Without practice, this may be difficult to get the entire tire around the rim. Use the tire lever to assist you.


If you are having a great deal of difficulty, ask a fellow biker, as having an extra set of hands can make this task much easier.

Know that the angle and forward position of a bike seat will affect your riding comfort.,
Loosen the bolt underneath the seat to change forward/backward seat position.,
Make sure the seat is far enough forward for a comfortable ride.,
Make sure that your seat angle is level with the floor.,
Loosen the bolts on the side of the seat to change the seat angle.",How to Adjust Your Bike Seat2," The height of your seat isn't the only thing that matters. Seats can be slid forward and backward and angled up or down to get rid of sore spots and make a more comfortable ride. To test for the perfect fore/aft position of the seat:


While riding, stop your feet so that one pedal is at 3:00 position (completely forward. Your foot should be flat.
Imagine a straight line coming down from the front of your knee to the ground.
This line should intersect through the middle of your pedal. In other words, your knee should be right over your pedal when in the 3:00 position., On the back of the seat, pointing down at the back wheel, is a small bolt that controls the seat placement. It connects to a bracket that clamps onto small metal tubes that hold the seat in place. Loosen this bolt by turning it counter-clockwise to lower the pressure on the clamps that keep the seat in place.








, You should be able to comfortably reach your handlebars, and your knee should be over the pedal when your foot is at 3:00 in the pedal rotation. A good test is to try standing as you ride. If your seat is in the right position, you should be able to stand up easily without pulling or pushing on the handlebars. If you experience any of the following problems, slide the seat forward or back while the bolt is still loose:


Trouble standing, reaching for the bars, and finger numbness can mean the seat is too far back.
Trouble feeling comfortable down hills and shoulder pain can mean your seat is too far forward., Use a carpenter's level to make sure the seat is flat -- this evenly distributes your weight for more comfortable riding. That said, if you experience discomfort in your crotch you can adjust the seat a little, though no more than 3 degrees in either direction.









Women should typically tilt the seat slightly down for more comfort.
Men should typically tilt the seat slightly up for more comfort., This bolt, usually on the right of the seat, allows you to easily change the angle of the seat and then tighten it in place again. Some older seats have two small bolts underneath the seat, one in front of the seat post and one behind, that are needed to change the seat angle. You must tighten one side to push that side up while loosening the other, almost like a see-saw.








Never make large adjustments to your seat angle. Check you seat height and forward position first, then adjust the angle slightly, if at all.

Remove the wheel from the bike.,
Use tire levers to remove the tire.,
Locate the hole that's causing the leak.,
Mark the hole in the tube.,
Remove any foreign objects from the hole.,
If necessary, sand around the hole.,
Apply the patch.,
Know when replacing the tube is a smarter choice.,
Replace the tube in the tire.,
Work the tire and tube back onto the wheel.,
Pump up the tube gradually to let the tube and tire settle into place.,
Replace the wheel on the bike.,
Consider buying a new tube when you can.",How to Patch a Bicycle Tube," The first thing you should do for any flat is to remove the affected wheel. Check the side of the wheel at the center of the spokes. If you have a quick release (which looks like a small lever), flip it over and spin it counterclockwise to loosen. If, on the other hand, you see a nut, you will need a wrench to loosen it. After this, disconnect the brakes, move the brake pads out of the way, and remove the wheel.


If you're dealing with the rear flat, you'll also have the chain and gears to deal with. Put slack in the chain by shifting into the smallest set of gears. Loosen the quick release or unscrew the nut holding the wheel in place as normal. If necessary, use your hands to pull back on the rear derailleur (the ""arm"" that the chain passes through containing the small pulleys) and/or maneuver the chain out of the way as you remove the wheel.





;
, When you've successfully removed the flat wheel, take the outer tire off. To do this, it can be helpful to use a sturdy prying tool. Some bike shops will sell small, specially-designed tools called tire levers for this purpose. Whether you use a tire lever or another tool, be careful not to pinch the tube and cause further damage as you work the tire away from the wheel. You can leave one lip of the tire over the wheel rim when you're done to make re-installation easier.


To be clear, you don't specifically need tire levers here. Any sort of prying tool that's strong enough for the task can work well. Even unconventional solutions like screwdrivers or butter knives can do an admirable job., When the tire has been removed, pull the flat tube out from the tire and pinpoint the site of the puncture. This can be done in several ways — a few are listed below:


Inflating the tube and visually checking the surface of the rubber for holes






Listening for any hissing noises






Feeling for streams of air






Plunging the tube in a container of water and looking for bubbles







, Flat-causing tire punctures can be surprisingly small. Once you've found one, you don't want to lose it! Use a piece of chalk to make a ""+"" or ""x"" that intersects at the point of the puncture. If you're using a glue-on patch, make your mark large so that you can still see it after you've smeared on the glue.


If you don't have chalk in your patch kit, a ballpoint pen or any other sort of writing utensil will do. Chalk, however, is preferable because it's obviously easier to see white chalk on black rubber than blue or black pen.

, Once you find the hole, carefully check to see if it was caused by a foreign object (like, for instance, a piece of broken glass, a sharp rock, etc.) or if it was a pinch flat (which will cause a puncture that looks like a snake bite but won't leave any foreign objects).Carefully check the inside rim of the tire for any protruding foreign objects and remove them if you find them. You don't want the same object that caused the flat in the first place to re-puncture your tire because you didn't see it.

, Different types of patches work in different ways — some require glue, while others do not, and some require sanding, while others can stick to the smooth rubber of the inner tube with no trouble. Consult the directions included with your patch kit. If you're directed to sand, use a small square of sandpaper to roughen up the area around the hole about as wide as the patch to be used. Making the rubber a little less smooth can improve the sticking power of certain types of adhesives.


If you're unsure about whether or not to sand, lightly sanding is unlikely to hurt most patches' ability to stick to the tube, so you may want to sand just in case.

, Next, stick your patch over the puncture hole according to any included directions. Some patches require glue, while others can stick to the tire on their own — while the latter are more convenient, they can sometimes be less reliable. General directions for both types of patches are below. If the directions included with your patch differ from these, follow your instructions, rather than these directions.


Glue patches: Apply the glue or rubber cement to the tube around the puncture hole, wait for the glue to set (many glues must dry until they are no longer tacky — consult any included directions for more information). Finally, place the patch on the mostly-dry glue and hold firmly in place for a few minutes until it has sealed the leak.






Non-glue patches (sometimes called ""self-adhesive"" patches): Simply remove the patch from its wrapper and lay the patch over the sanded puncture like a sticker. Press down firmly to secure and, if necessary, wait until dry before riding.







, In situations where you have a severely damaged tube, you may want to avoid wasting your patch by opting to simply replace the entire tube instead. Tubes that have serious damage may not stay inflated long enough with the patch to make using it worth it, making full-on replacement a better choice. Luckily, if you can get your hands on a new tube, the process of replacing the old one isn't hard. Below are certain types of tube damage which may signal that it's better to forego a patch:


Multiple holes
Large tears
Air leaking even after patch is applied.

, After your patch has had an opportunity to set, carefully feel around the inside of the tire for any protruding foreign objects, such as metal wire, which may have caused the puncture. Take your repaired tube and carefully lay it in the hollow inside portion of the tire. This is usually easiest if you inflate the tube slightly and slide one side in first, then work the rest in as necessary. When you're done, double-check to make sure none of the tube is hanging out of the tire.


Make sure the inflation valve is pointing inward (away from the tire) when you lay the tube in the tire so that you can eventually inflate the tube.







, Next, use your thumbs to slide the tire (which contains the partly-inflated tube) back onto the wheel. Press the outer lips of the tire over the metal lip of the wheel so that they ""lock"" securely in place, being careful not to pinch the tube between the tire and the rim. You may need to use your tire lever or prying tool to help you with the very last part of the tire, which can often be tricky to get over the lip of the wheel.


Note that some high-end bike tires are meant to only turn in one direction. In this case, the intended direction of rotation will usually be indicated by small arrows on the walls of the tires. Don't install the tire backwards! This can reduce the bike's performance and cause the tire to wear improperly.
Don’t forget to take the valve lid off when replacing the tube in the wheel. The lidless inflation valve should slide through a circle-shaped hole in the wheel so that it can be easily accessed for pumping.

, Next, grab an automatic or hand-operated pump and start putting some air in your tire. Go gradually to allow the tube to shift and settle within the tire as it expands. When fully-inflated, give the tire a squeeze, let the bike sit for a few minutes, then squeeze the tire again. If it feels about as firm the second time as it did the first time, you're ready to ride!


If you're worried about the tube settling improperly within the tube, feel free to inflate it before re-installing the tire on the wheel. Note, however, that this can make the tire trickier to get back on.

, You're nearly done — all you've got to do now is slide the wheel back on the bike, secure the quick release or screw on the wheel nut, re-connect the brakes, and you're good to go (unless you've been working with your rear wheel, in which case you'll also need to carefully loop the chain around the gears again). Peddle cautiously until you feel confident that the patch won't immediately burst, then resume riding as you normally would!

, Inner tube patches, while handy, aren't necessarily meant to last you forever. These patches are great for getting you out of the woods when your tire blows and you have no replacement, but they don't offer a good long-term solution for a punctured inner tube. While good-quality patches can approach the reliability of a brand-new inner tube, others can leak for a time immediately after patching or may offer only temporary protection.There's no substitute for an actual replacement, so you may want to at least shop for a new inner tube when you get the chance so that you can have one handy if you suffer another flat in the near future.

Prop the bike up so you can spin the wheels as you work.,
Shift the bike to the highest possible gear.,
Locate the barrel adjuster, then follow this cable through the bike to look for any issues.,
Attempt to shift through all of the gears in both directions, noting any issues.,
Return to the highest gear and start shifting until you reach a ""problem area,"" as noted before.,
Rotate the barrel adjuster counter-clockwise to help the chain shift down, towards the larger gears.,
Rotate the barrel adjuster clockwise to help the chain shift up, towards the smaller gears.,
Check all of the gears by shifting up and down slowly.,
Lubricate the screws and pivot points with bike grease to prevent further issues.",How to Adjust a Rear Bicycle Derailleur1," You'll need to either lift the bike into a bike stand or flip the bike over so that it rests on the seat and handlebars. To adjust a derailleur, you'll need to pedal the bike while working.;
, This is smallest gear sprocket on the rear cassette. It is furthest away from the bike. A derailleur works through cable tension, and the highest gear is actually the point of lowest tension, meaning the derailleur is doing the least work and is thus easiest to adjust.









While pedaling the bike, locate the cable leading to your rear derailleur and pull on it gently. Note how it shifts the bike for you! All a derailleur does is adjust this cable tension.

, The barrel adjuster is the small cylinder connecting the cable to the derailleur. Follow your cable from the rear derailleur up to the handlebars. The tension on this cable is what actually causes gears to shift. Make sure it is seated in its housing and isn't bent, loose, or caught in anything. This isn't a common issue, but it happens.







, Keep pedaling the bike, shifting gears one at a time. Make a mental note when of times the chain skips a gear or needs to be clicked twice to jump a gear. Does the bike have problems going up the bike, or down? Is there any noise or grinding?








, For example, if the bike struggles to get from fourth to fifth gear, stop shifting on the fourth gear. While still pedaling, turn the barrel adjuster in the direction you need the cable to fall which, in this case, would be counter-clockwise. Tightening the barrel changes the tension of the cable which, in turn, dictates the gear you're in.








Note that if the bike is upside-down, you need to turn the barrel away from the direction you want the chain to move. , Loosening the barrel adjuster tightens the cable, making it easier to pull up towards the larger gears. If you shift down and nothing happens, leave it in the shifted gear and keep turning the pedals. Turn the barrel counter-clockwise until the chain jumps up and shifts on its own -- your bike is adjusted.







, If your chain struggles to move away from the bike, you can tighten the barrel. If it won't shift when you click it, keep pedaling the bike and rotate the barrel. This decreases the tension on the derailleur, allowing the chain to ""fall"" smoothly to the smaller gears. Keep turning slowly until the chain shifts on its own, matching the gear you just tried to shift to.








Loosening the barrel also helps if your chain is jumping two gears at once when heading to the larger gears., Once you've adjusted one gear to shift smoothly, the rest of the derailleur usually falls right into place. Check all of the gears to ensure you're adjusted, then move on. If you still have issues:









Turn the barrel 2-3 turns to the right to full loosen it, then start over. If the cable was too tense when you started, it could need to be re-adjusted from scratch.
Check for bent gears or derailleur arms. If this didn't work, there is likely a larger issue with the bike., Keep the chain lubricated with special chain lube to ensure that stiff chain links do not affect the shifting, and to make sure that the drive train will last a long time.








"
"
Only adjust your limit screws if the chain is popping out on either side of the derailleur.,
Turn the ""H"" (high) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the right, away from the bike.,
Turn the ""L"" (low) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the left (and potentially into your wheel).,
Shift to the high and low gears, visually confirming that the derailleur is lined up with the center of the gears.,
Test both screws and watch to see when the derailleur moves if the H and L are no longer marked.",How to Adjust a Rear Bicycle Derailleur2," The two screws labeled ""L"" and ""H"" are used to adjust your limits. Basically, they determine how far in either direction the chain can travel. Unless you're having issues with the chain falling out, there is no reason to adjust these screws on the rear derailleur (as they were likely set properly at the factory). However, if your bike was in an accident or you installed a new derailleur, these screws may need to be adjusted.









If you keep slipping a chain, check your limit screws.
If you can't shift into the highest or lowest gear, check limit screws.
If your chain is grinding against your frame, check limit screws., Of course, you would turn it counter-clockwise if the chain is getting stopped too early. The high limit is for the smallest gear in the rear derailleur., Again, turn it the opposite way (counter-clockwise) if the limit is pushed too far in. On the rear derailleur, the low limit is for the biggest gear., Once you've got the limits where you want them, make sure they are lined up nicely. You should see the jockey wheel (metal arm with small cogs under the derailleur) lined up right underneath the chain.







, If you are in the furthest gear, you will see the derailleur moving as you adjust the screws. So, if you need to adjust the low limit, shift to the gear on the far left, the biggest one. Adjust both screws a 1

",How to Mend a Puncture in a Bike Tire," If the tire is blown out, or has a large hole, it will have to be replaced. If you rode it through a patch of thorns, it may have dozens of holes, but if it is a single small puncture, for instance a nail, often it can be fixed on the bike. It is better if it`s only minimal.;
, Make sure it is not on the brake levers or the gear shifter. A block of wood may be needed to support it off of these items.

, Spin the tire slowly. Look for anything sticking out of the tire, such as a nail, a piece of wire, a screw, or any other object.

, You may want to invest in a tire valve tool, but a matchstick, or ink pen can be used to depress the schrader valve stem to do this. The valve stem is the small round piece of metal underneath the plastic cap where air is put into the tire.

, Use tire levers to remove the tire from the rim. Insert one between the rim and the tire, push down on the lever to lift the tire from the rim, insert the second tire lever, and run it around the rim to remove the tire. If you don't have tire levers you may use a screwdriver as follows: Push a dull flat blade (common) screwdriver between the tire bead and the rim, and pry the edge of the tire off the rim. You will need to pry the tire loose around the rim, about an inch or two (2.5 cm - 5 cm) apart, until the tire becomes loose enough to pull free on one side.

, Be careful not to rip the valve stem off. The tube should be hanging between the rim and the frame, so if it is a back wheel, don't let it become entangled with the gears or chain.

, A bike tube will double or triple its original diameter, and the more air, the more the leaking hole will expand, making it easier to find it.

, Feel and listen for air escaping. An even easier way is to hold part of the tube under water, for example in a bucket, to see bubbles escaping from the hole.

, Use a ballpoint pen or a piece of chalk to draw a large ""+"" centered on the puncture. Otherwise, you may have difficulty applying the patch. Remove the air from the tube once more.

, Most patch kits come with a small metal rasp or a postage stamp-sized piece of sandpaper to do this.

, Allow it to dry until the liquid gloss disappears. Let as much air as possible out of the tube.

, Be careful not to touch the sticky adhesive surface, and place the sticky side on the tube, pressing it firmly into place. You will need to use one hand to hold the back of the tube to press hard enough to get the patch to seal.

, Be sure that the valve stem is aligned with the hole in the rim it sticks out of.

, Important: Avoid using levers if possible, and never use a screwdriver to perform this step. The object is to push the bead of the tire back over the rim, without pinching it and possibly causing another puncture.

, Reconnect the brake if you disconnected it to remove the wheel. If it was a back wheel, work the chain around the gear cluster. Verify that the rim is centered between the brakes. Then tighten down the nuts or quick-release lever firmly.

, Read the tire pressure printed on the side of the tire and use a tire pressure gauge to avoid over-inflating the tire. Put away the tools and finish your ride.

Stand the bike upright by leaning it against a wall or using the kick stand.,
Measure the distance in inches from the ground beneath the tire to the center point of the wheel.,
Measure the flat part of the tire across the tread from one side to the other.,
Remember when purchasing a new tire that traditional, or standard sizes place the diameter first, followed by the width.",How to Measure a Bicycle Wheel1," When the bicycle is upright, you will be able to measure the bike wheel without the bike tipping onto you. If you are measuring the bike alone, a retractable metal tape measure will be sturdier than a plastic tape measure while leaving you a free hand.;
, This measurement is the wheel's radius, or half of its diameter. Multiply the length by two in order to calculate the tire's diameter. With the exception of BMX models, most adult bicycle wheels are between 26 and 29 inches in diameter., The distance is the tire's width. It can vary greatly depending on the tire's intended use. Generally, the wider the tread, the rougher the intended terrain, while narrower treads promise a smoother, faster ride.

, For example, a tire sized 26 x 1.75 would have a 26-inch diameter and a 1.75-inch width across the tread. "

Let the air out.,
Remove any nuts and keepers from the tubes valve stem.,
Break the bead.,
Add lube to the tire if necessary.,
Insert the spooned end of your tire iron.,
Take your second tire iron.,
Keep going around the rim.,
Start working on the other side of the rim.,
Pull the rim away from the tire, allowing the rim to set into the tire.",How to Remove a MX Tire on Your Motocross Bike," The first thing you need to do is let the air out of the tube by removing the valve stem core, using a vale stem core removing tool. Loosen the nut on your rim lock and leave the nut so that it is still threaded on generously at the end of the rim lock stud.
, Leave the nut on the rim lock as the end of the rim lock stud threads.

, Place the wheel on your wheel stand using a tire iron. Insert the iron into the seam where the tire meets the wheel. Start to lever the tire off the rims bead seating area towards the center of the rim (breaking the bead). Work your way around the wheel until the tire bead is now collapsing into the dip in the center of the rim. Turn the wheel over and repeat on the other side of the tire.


Note that some tire irons have a flat pointed end that works better for breaking a bead than the spooned end of the iron.

, Now that we have the bead broken on the tire and both tire beads are collapsed into the center of the rim, you can get a little lube on the bead area to help the removal, but it's generally not necessary. You can also install a bead buddy on one side, or both, of the wheel holding the tire beads into the center of the rim.

, Do this starting a couple inches from your bead buddy, into the rim, with the spoon side facing the tire bead. Use the rim to lever the tire bead out of the rim and hold it steady.

, Move a short distance from where you are holding the bead outside the rim in the same way you did the first tire iron and lever the bead outside of the rim


Find the point where the tire iron is least resistant to fit under the tire bead.

, At this point you should be able to remove your first tire iron and move along the rim. Normally, after the second or third time you pull the bead over the rim, you should be able to continue all the way around the rim with just one tire iron or spoon. You may have to press and hold the rim lock up into the tire, by pressing on the rim lock stem, while you work the tire off in this area.

, Please note that this is not the time to remove the tube. You may remove any bead buddy tools at this time. You should remove the opposing side of the tire in the same way as outlined for the previous side. When you get to the rim lock, you may have to again press the rim lock stem into the rim and tire, and work the bead off.


When finished, you should have both beads out side of the rim and the wheel will now be in the center of the tire with the tube.

, The rim should work out of the tire and can be set aside. If reusing your tube, install your valve stem core and check for leaks or pinches.


And there you have it! Tire is off, tube is in the tire, no fighting, no pinching.

Recognize if your bike's wheels are measured by the International Organization for Standardization system instead of the standard method.,
Ensure the bike is propped up against the wall or on its kickstand.,
Measure the tire's width in millimeters.,
Remember when purchasing a new tire measured by the ISO system, the width is listed first, followed by the diameter.",How to Measure a Bicycle Wheel2," The ISO measuring system uses millimeters to signify the size of your bicycle's wheel. If you don't have a measuring tape with metric rules, just be aware that there are 25.4 millimeters in one inch and determine the width with a calculator, multiplying inches x 25.4.

, Measure in millimeters from the center of the wheel to only the inner edge of the tire. Once again, double the figure to determine the diameter. Most adult bicycle tires measured with the ISO system range from 650 to 700 millimeters in diameter.

, Use the same process listed above, across the tread from one side to the other. Keep in mind that tires of various widths can be used on the same bicycle wheel, as long as the difference is not too drastic.

, For example, a bicycle wheel sized 53.3 x 700 would have tread 53.3 millimeters wide and a wheel with a 700-millimeter diameter from the inner edge of one side of the tire to the other.

Measure the circumference, or distance around the outside of a bicycle wheel in order to properly calibrate a bicycle speedometer, odometer, GPS or computer.,
Calculate circumference easily by multiplying the tire's diameter by pi.The circumference of any circle can be determined quickly if you already know the diameter of the tire from the outer edge of one side to the other.,
Measure the circumference with a string.,
Add a dot of wet paint to a spot on the bicycle tire's tread.",How to Measure a Bicycle Wheel3," Just as your car's speedometer and odometer will provide inaccurate data if you change the size of its wheels, bicycle equipment must also be set based on the size of your tires. Whether you've just purchased a cyclometer or you need to calibrate an existing one because you've switched to tires with a different sized tread, you will need to determine the wheel's circumference.

, As pi is equal to 3.14, the circumference of a 26-inch tire can be reached by multiplying 26 x 3.14 to equal a circumference of 81.64 inches.


If you already know the tire's diameter and width, you can also look up the circumference on various online charts. , If you don't already know the wheel's diameter, you can still measure its circumference by evenly wrapping a string around the outside edge of the tire. Mark or cut the string at the spot where it reaches back to its starting point and measure its length to determine the circumference.

, Carefully push the bicycle in a straight line for at least two rotations, ensuring the paint marks the ground twice. Measure the ground from the first spot of paint to the next in order to determine the tire's circumference.

Find out about puncture-resistant tires.,
Choose among the puncture-resistant tire brands.,
Fit the puncture-proof tires by referring to video guides.,
Consider additional advice specific to your priorities.",How to Avoid Bike Tire Punctures1," These tires use additional protective layers under the rubber or stronger material like kevlar to prevent sharp objects penetrating through to the tube. The most puncture-proof tyres are significantly heavier and stiffer than normal tyres. So they will mean your starts and cruising speed are a bit slower and the ride can be a little firmer too. For most utility cyclists these minor issues are tolerable given the benefits of not wasting time and hassles fixing punctures.;
,


Schwalbe Marathon Plus tires are considered by many to be the standout and are virtually puncture-proof (available for 25mm tire width and up).Schwalbe Durano Plus tires have a slightly thinner inner protection belt but are best for tires of 23mm width or less.
Other puncture-resistant brands exist such as Continental Gatorskins, Specialized Armadillos and Maxxis Re-Fuse. Check their reviews.
The best puncture-resistant tyres are usually expensive in bike shops and are significantly cheaper online. So you are often best off buying them yourself rather then trying to get your bike's tyres upgraded when buying a new bike in store. However, you can try to use the online price to get a best offer in-store if the tire is available.

, Fitting the toughest tires can be difficult as they are stiff and are difficult to keep on the rim. Use straps to tie the tire in place as you move around the rim. Check YouTube for tips The Schwalbe Marathon Plus is especially hard to fit, but watching a guide on how can help you get started., Those who depend on cycling for transport will likely prioritise reliability and should review further tips on choosing, buying and using puncture-resistant tires. Puncture-proof tyres are the key to reliable transport."

Check the surface of both bike tires after every ride.,
Replace worn tires.,
Take care where you ride.,
Do not ride the bicycle when the tires aren't properly filled with air as it increases the chance of a puncture.This may happen due to unbalanced pressure exerted on the tyres.",How to Avoid Bike Tire Punctures2," If you have the chance to remove any debris or sharp pieces, this is the ideal time to do so before anything starts working its way into the tire.


Also check the sidewalls of the tires. If you see cuts, splits or tears, these indicate areas where the tire may break under pressure.

, When the tread has worn off, it's far easier for puncturing items to work their way through the tire.

, Stay alert for things that might harm your bike tires, such as broken bottles and smashed glass. Stay out of the gutters where broken things tend to accumulate. Be careful when riding through areas where there are thorns and other spiky parts of plants; some seasons may be worse than others depending on the life cycles of the plants.

, So, always check that your cycle tires are filled properly before riding it.

A Schrader valve is also called an American valve, or a car valve.,
Figure out the recommended PSI for your tires.,
Locate a pump.,
Inflate the tire.,
To deflate a tire with a Schrader valve, simply press on the springy valve stem with a fingernail or other small tool until all the air escapes.








",How to Inflate Bike Tires1," The valve stem is surrounded by a threaded valve core; to press down on the stem, you need to use a tool like a pen cap or your thumbnail. Schrader valves are typically wider in diameter and shorter than Presta or Woods valves. They're usually found on cars, less expensive bikes and mountain bikes. To open a Schrader valve, simply unscrew the rubber cap at the top.






;
, This is usually on raised print on the side of your bike tires and will consist of a range. Don't let your PSI go any lower than the lowest number; the high number is the recommended maximum PSI.








, If you don't already have one, try to use a gas station pump, or borrow one from a friend.









If you have a Schrader valve, you're in luck - you won't need an adapter to use a gas station pump. Ask the attendant for a pressure gauge and inflate your tires in small bursts, checking the pressure after each one. Gas station pumps are extremely high pressure, and you can pop your tires if you're not careful.
If you're using a bicycle pump with two openings, the larger one is meant for the Schrader valve.
Smart pumps with one opening will automatically adjust to accommodate a Schrader valve.
A pump with one opening may require you to reverse an internal rubber stop to fit a Schrader valve. Unscrew the face cap and find the rubber stop. The larger end should be facing out for a Schrader valve.

, Unscrew the rubber cap on top of the valve and put it somewhere safe, like your back pocket. You don't want to lose it.









Put the pump on the valve. If there's a lever near the nozzle, make sure it's in the open position (parallel to the nozzle) when you're putting it on the valve; snap the lever down into the closed position (perpendicular to the nozzle) when it's on. Keep an eye on the PSI as you pump.
Flip the lever back up to remove the pump, then quickly return the rubber cap to the valve.

The Presta valve, also called a Sclaverand or French valve, is usually found on high-end road bikes.,
Open the valve.,
Figure out the recommended PSI for your tires.,
Locate a pump.,
Inflate the tire.,
To deflate a tire with a Presta valve, open the brass cap and press on the springy valve stem until all the air escapes.








",How to Inflate Bike Tires2," Presta valves are longer and narrower in diameter than Schrader valves, and feature an external valve stem that is protected by a valve cap, instead of being surrounded by a valve core.








, To open a Presta valve, unscrew the dust cap at the top and put it somewhere safe. Then, loosen the small brass cap on the valve stem - it won't come off completely, but you should be able to raise it a bit. To check if you've loosened the bras cap enough, press on the valve stem. If you can hear air escaping in a sharp burst, you've loosened it enough.








, This is usually on raised print on the side of your bike tires and will consist of a range. Don't let your PSI go any lower than the lowest number; the high number is the recommended maximum PSI.








, Try to use a gas station pump, or borrow one from a friend. You can also purchase pumps at your local cycle shop.









To use a gas station pump on a Presta valve, you'll need a Presta adapter. This is a small cap you can screw onto a Presta valve to essentially turn it into a Schrader valve. Some older bike pumps might also require you to have a Presta adapter. You can purchase one from your local cycle shop. When using a gas station pump, ask the attendant for a pressure gauge and inflate your tires in small bursts, checking the pressure after each one. Gas station pumps are extremely high pressure, and you can pop your tires if you're not careful.
If you're using a bike pump with two openings, the smaller one is for a Presta valve.
Smart pumps with one opening will automatically adjust to accommodate a Presta valve.
A pump with one opening may require you to reverse an internal rubber stop to fit a Presta valve. Unscrew the face cap and find the rubber stop. The smaller end should be facing out for a Presta valve.

, Open the Presta valve by unscrewing the dust cap and loosening the smaller brass cap.









Put the pump on the valve. If there's a lever near the nozzle, make sure it's in the open position (parallel to the nozzle) when you're putting it on the valve; snap the lever down into the closed position (perpendicular to the nozzle) when it's on. Keep an eye on the PSI as you pump.
Flip the lever back up to remove the pump, and screw the brass cap closed.
Replace the dust cap.

"
A Woods valve, also known as a Dunlop or English valve, is commonly used in Asia and Europe.",How to Inflate Bike Tires3," It is larger like a Schrader valve, but employs the same mechanism as a Presta valve. Refer to the Presta valve section for instructions on how to inflate a tire with a Woods valve.

Happy bike riding!








",How to Replace a Bicycle Tire," If they are extremely tight, spray some lubricant on the nuts - a silicone lubricant or even vegetable oil will do the trick very well. (Many modern bikes will not have nuts. They have a quick-release which you can easily loosen and remove the wheel).






;
, Every brake setup is a little different but you should likely be able to slip the brake cable out of a socket on the brake arms to release them. Some brakes may require that you loosen the cable from a clamped position.








, If it's the rear wheel, you will need to lift the chain clear of the gear cluster. To ease the removal of a rear wheel, shift the chain to the smallest gear on the wheel before loosening the skewer or nuts. If it's the front wheel, it will be easier.








, With a presta valve you need to unscrew the top part of the stem to release the air in the tube. During this step you'll also want to remove the lock ring that screws onto the stem and sits flush on the rim if your bike has one.








, With all the air out of the tube squeeze the tire together and you'll see the tire release from the inside of the rim, this will help when removing the tire.








, You can use the handle of a spoon or similar object if you don't have tire levers but be very careful, as you risk scratching or damaging the rims of the wheel and/or puncturing the inner tube. Ease one lever in under the wheel rim and lever out the edge of the tire (taking great care not to puncture the inner tube) and pry it up over the wheel rim. Move around the rim about an eighth of the circumference and repeat the process again, leaving the first tool in place. Now zip the second lever around the wheel and the tire should come right off on one side.








,, Best way to find an air leak is by inserting the tube with air in water. Where air bubbles come out , there is a hole in your tube.








, Use caution when feeling inside the tire as a nail, or glass can cut you. Be sure to remove any thorns, glass, or nails with pliers if you find them. Adjust rim tape to cover protruding spoke.








, Unwrap your new tube and remove the plastic dust cap and the lock ring.








, Putting a few pumps of air in the tube before will help to avoid pinching the tube when putting the tire on the rim.








, This process is difficult but try not to use tire levers, a screwdriver, or other similar object as you vastly increase your chance of puncturing your new tube. Check the tire wall for an arrow or similar to indicate the direction of rotation - some tires have a ""direction specific"" tread pattern. Put one side in first, then ease the partially inflated tube into the tire and put the other side on.

Let the air out of the pneumatic tire.,
Insert a tire iron, or any tool with a slender handle and no sharp edges, under the lip of the tire.,
Work the tire iron, or more than one if you have them, around the lip, prying it out of the side nearest you.,
Start seating the foam tire into the rim with your hands.,
Tie the tire in place.,
Seat the tire by hand as far as you can.,
Lever the rest of the tire on with your paddle.",How to Install Foam Bicycle Tires1,";
,


Some companies include an installation paddle with the tires, or sell them separately. If you don't have one, just find another long, durable object you can use as a lever. A tire iron or oversize screwdriver should work.

, Then remove the tire from the rim.


Pry out both the old tire and tube with a tire iron. Your foam tire will replace both of these components.

, Pick any point along the rim and do your best to squeeze the foam tire into it. It doesn't need to fit perfectly yet, but it should stay seated in the rim without having to hold it down., Once the tire is seated into the rim in one location, fasten it at that spot to keep it from slipping out during installation. A zip tie is the easiest way to do this. If you don't have a zip tie, tie it in place with string or fasten with duct tape.If the tire keeps popping out as you install, use more zip ties to fasten each section of the tire.

, Working around the diameter, you will find that somewhere past the halfway point, it gets difficult to push the tire onto the rim any farther. At this point, there are a few things you can do.

You may need to hit the tire in place with a rubber mallet, or squeeze in the edges with a durable plastic pry bar.Wipe the rim with liquid soap and water (optional). Some tires are more difficult to install than others. If you're having a tough time pulling the tire on, mix ¼ cup (60mL) liquid hand soap or dish soap with 2 cups (480mL) water. Wipe this onto the rim before you continue installation.Double-check that the tire is the correct size for your rims. Measure the width of your rims using calipers, and compare the result to the product info for your foam tires.

, Place the paddle between a loose section of tire and the rim. Hold the paddle end against the rim, and lever the paddle upward to stretch the tire onto the rim. Once it snaps onto the rim, repeat with the rest of the tire until the whole thing is seated on the rim. Work your way around slowly, only stretching on the next couple inches (several centimeters) at a time."
"Follow the instructions above until you get to the halfway point.,
Open a vise to just fit the foam tire, and loosely insert the tire and rim up to where you have pressed in the tire.,
Continuing to hold your start position with one hand, and letting the vise maintain the end position, insert your tire iron a few inches into the unseated portion, prying it in.,
Moving your hand up to the new start position, repeat this until the tire is fully on the rim.

,
Seat it completely by removing from the vise, and hitting it against the ground while rotating it 20 or 30 degrees between hits.

,
After both tires have been replaced, reinstall the wheels and your bicycle will never have a flat tire again.

",How to Install Foam Bicycle Tires2,", There is no need to tighten the vise.

Confirm that the tire is in place.",How to Install Foam Bicycle Tires3," There are many different products labeled ""tire installation tool."" For this method, you'll need one that looks like a long metal bar with a ""mounting guide"" that slips over it. The mounting guide has a curved channel about the same width as your bike rim, so the tire can fit onto it.


Look for this from companies that sell foam tires or tubeless tires.

, After removing the old tire and tube, snap a section of the new tire into place and secure with a zip tie.

, Fit the end of the bar over the wheel axle or quick release pin. The bar should rotate freely around the wheel without coming detached.

, The mounting bar channel should face the same direction as the rim channel.

, Fit a section of loose tire onto the mounting guide. Slide the mounting guide up near the rim, so the tire stay taut and secure in the mounting guide.

, As you rotate the bar around the wheel, slip the tire off the mounting guide and onto the rim. Once some of the tire is seated, the tool should do most of the work for you.

, If there are any loose areas, squeeze them down or push them into place with a plastic pry bar or rubber mallet. Once finished, remove the zip tie and reattach the wheel to your bike.

, For some Shimano housings, it is possible to add oil from the cog shaped side of the housing. Oil or penetrant loosens up any grease or dirt inside the ratcheting mechanism.

, If the hub used to be quiet then the ratcheting sound should get louder. This is a good sign as it means the mechanism isn't damaged. Keep adding oil until the ratcheting sound is clear and the mechanism spins with minimal effort. The end result may leave the hub quite loud and with a barely audible grittiness to it, this isn't a major concern as it takes a long time for the mechanism to wear out completely. Spare housings are also quite cheap.

Make sure that the brake pads aren't worn down.,
Check for a lip on the brake pad.,
Lubricate the lever pivots.",How to Fix Stuck Bicycle Brakes1," Pads that are worn down significantly will stick no matter how much you adjust them. If your brake pads are less than 1/4-inch wide, then you need to replace them. They should be ""toed-in,"" meaning that front edge of the pads should touch the wheel rim when you press the brake lightly., Some brake pads have a ""lip"" that sticks out on the side closest to the hub. If you've worn your pads down around the lip, then it might be stuck in the rim.








Shave down the lip. If you do find that the lip is sticking out too far, shave it down with a razor so that the wheel can spin smoothly. Be very careful not to slice off so much that the brake pads won't work!

, These are the points upon which the individual parts of your breaks pivot. If your levers feel rigid, try oiling the ""pivot"" pins on the lever handle. Place a dab of oil on each pivot point. Use a light machine oil or a special bicycle lubricant for best results.After you oil the lever pivots, they should feel snappy and quick when you pull them.









Do not use lubricant on brake pads, rotors, or rims. This might ruin the pads and make it hard for you to stop your bike!

Turn the bike upside down or hang it from a bike stand.,
Note what gear the bike is in.,
Push the rear derailleur arm towards the handle bars to get slack on the chain.,
Use your other hand to slide the chain back on the right gear.,
Slowly pedal the bike with one hand.",How to Fix a Slipped Bike Chain1," This will make fixing the chain easier and prevent the bike from rolling around while you work. Flip the bike so that it rests on the seat and handlebars, setting it down gently to prevent scratching or scuffing.


Bike stands hold the bike right-side up in the air and are great for maintenance. However, since most chains slip on the road you will likely not have access to one.;
, Derailleurs are the small machines on your front and back gears that physically move the chain from gear to gear. Note where it is currently resting by looking down the derailleur -- it will be lined up with the gear. You want to put the chain back on this gear.


The front derailleur, right next to the pedals, looks like a little metal bracket that hovers over the gear the chain should be on.
The rear derailleur, found by the back wheel, looks like a small mechanical arm. This arm slides back and forth underneath the cassette (collection of gears) to move the chain. It will be underneath the right gear.
Many bikes will tell you the gear number on the handlebars, but you need to know how to read them to make sense of it:


The left hand adjusts your front gears. 1 is the gear closest to the bike, or smallest gear.

The right hand adjusts the back gears. 1 is the gear closest to your bike, which is the biggest gear., This is the small metal arm next to the cog on the bottom of the derailleur. There is usually a little metal square right next to the cog that lets you push the derailleur without getting too greasy. It should fold gently towards the front of the bike so that the chain hangs with a lot of slack.

, Pick up the chain with 2-3 fingers and drape it on top of the appropriate gear. You should have enough slack to get 10-15 teeth on the gear into the groves of the chain. Slowly release the derailleur once you have some teeth in place.

, As you pedal, you'll notice that the teeth you attached manually will guide the rest of the chain back into place. Keep pedaling for 2-3 more rotations to make sure that the chain is securely in place.


Make sure you are pedaling forward -- the back wheel should move as you pedal.

Check the cables.,
Adjust the cable lengths to increase tension.,
Lubricate the cables.,
Remove the tubing.",How to Fix Stuck Bicycle Brakes2," If your levers are fine and the pad isn't stuck to the wheel somehow, then your cables form the next likely problem area. You should be able to fix your cables by hand without consulting a mechanic.If you do have trouble, however, don't hesitate to take your bicycle in to a shop.








, The cable length adjustment is perhaps the most basic brake repair task that you'll encounter. On a typical safety bike, you can make fine adjustments without any specialized tools. Simply turn an adjusting barrel to make the best fit at the end of a length of cable housing. The adjusting barrel for a V brake is normally located on the hand-lever, where the housing exits.







, Get lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube. Then, spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrule: the cap where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers.Use a light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to ""3 in 1"" Oil, or purchase a special brake cable oil at a bike shop. Spray gently, and don't over-saturate the cables.









WD-40 and other industrial-grade degreasing products may ""wash"" the factory lubricant off the cable. When the WD-40 evaporates, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.

, If the cable is still stiff, try taking it out of its plastic tubing. First, remove the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever. Then, pull the cable out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable. Finally, reinstall the cable if it is not damaged.









Put the cables back into the casing. Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end where you removed it.
Then, check the ""free travel"": the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel. Tighten the clamp when the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released.

Bleed and replace the brake fluid.,
Consult your user's manual for more specific instructions.,
Adjust the calipers.,
Take your bike to a mechanic.",How to Fix Stuck Bicycle Brakes3," This only applies to hydraulic brake systems. If you have hydraulic brakes, then the fluid will occasionally need to be bled and replaced.








Make sure you don't get a lot of air bubbles in your replacement fluid. This can lead to the brakes feeling soft.Never use mineral oil as brake fluid if your user's manual specifies DOT (Department of Transportation-approved brake fluid).Likewise, never use DOT if your manual tells you to use mineral oil.' If you mixed up your fluids last time you bled the system, then that might be your problem., There are several kinds of hydraulic systems, and each is a little bit different. Look to your manual for step-by-step instructions. If you can't access your manual, try to figure out exactly what type of hydraulic system you have, and then find online instructions for that specific system. If you're still having trouble, then consider visiting a bike shop.

, The calipers are the part of the bike that actually squeeze the brake pads to the tire. Here's how to adjust them:









Unscrew the brake pads, located on the inside of the brake calipers above your tires. The brake pad is the small piece of rubber on the lower inside of the caliper that actually comes into contact with the wheel.Adjust the brake so that it is 3 - 5 mm from the rim.
Tighten the brake pad. Spin the wheel in the air and test the brakes. Adjust further as needed., If all else fails, then it may be most efficient to ask a professional to fix your brakes. Look for a reputable bike shop or mechanic in your area.


Read bicycle shop reviews online before you visit. You should be able to get a good sense for whether the mechanics there are helpful.

Take care of your drivetrain to prevent chain slippage.,
Use an old rag and some biodegreaser to scrub the chain.,
Use a bicycle brush or old toothbrush to clean between your gears.,
Wipe away any visible grime on the derailleur and chainrings.,
Purchase a chain cleaner for seriously grimy chains.,
Lube your bike chain after cleaning it.",How to Fix a Slipped Bike Chain2," The drivetrain is the transmission of your bike. It consists of all the parts that get your back wheel moving: chain rings (big gears next to your pedals), a cassette (collection of gears on your back wheel), a rear derailleur (metal arm on the back wheel), and the chain itself. As dirt, grit and grime collect on your drive train, it wears down and becomes prone to skips and slips.


Frequent cleaning and maintenance of your drive train can add years to your bike's working lifespan.You will need to turn the bike upside down, or clamp it in a bike rack, in order to work on the drive train.

, Biodegreaser, sometimes called biodegradable solvent, is a powerful soap that cuts through grime but won't ruin your chain. Most bike stores sell it next to the chain lube. Pour a little bit on a damp rag and clamp it lightly over the chain with one hand. Use the other hand to pedal the bike, running the chain through your rag for 2-3 cycles.


Go through 2-3 cycles putting pressure on the top and bottom of the chain, then another few putting pressure on the sides.
Lightly scrub away any patches of grease or grime with your rag if you still see them.

, Just like human teeth, gears need to be flossed from time to time. Dip your brush into the biodegradable solvent and run it in between each gear as you pedal with the other hand. This removes clumps of grease that can dislodge your chain if they are allowed to get too large.


Use a screwdriver to scrape off hard to reach areas or precise, small spots.

, If it looks dirty then you should get rid of it. Use your damp rag, brush, and a little degreaser to get into as many nooks and crannies as you can and get your bike sparkling clean. Let the bike do the work for you whenever possible, holding the rag/brush in place while spinning the pedals. Common areas to focus on include:


Both sides of the jockey wheels, which are the small cogs on the derailleur arm.
The backside (closest to the bike) of the chain rings.
The bike frame, joints, and hinges near the chain., If a rag and a toothbrush don't cut it, you'll need a chain cleaning tool. These little boxes clamp over your chain. You add degreaser and hold the tool in place while pedaling the bike, allowing it to automatically brush and scrub the chain links for you. They are only $20-$30 and frequently come with degreaser and a brush., Purchase a bottle of bike lube, which should both lubricate the chain and protect it from dirt and moisture. After cleaning and drying the chain with your rag, slowly turn the pedals. Apply a single drop of lube to every 2-4 links, right on the joint where one link meets another. After you've gone through the whole chain, shift through your gears and apply another 10-12 drops. Use your rag to wipe up any excess lube from the chain when you are done, as extra lube can hold dirt and lead to grime.


Your goal is a light coating of lube on the entire chain.Anytime you ride in the rain, clean the chain, or hear squeaking, you should apply lube.
Feel the chain with your fingers -- if it feels dry then you need to apply more lube.

Learn to shift properly to keep your chain in place on climbs.,
Adjust your limit screws if the chain always falls out in the same direction.,
Replace bent or sticking links.,
Check if your chain is worn out.,
Determine if you need a new cassette.",How to Fix a Slipped Bike Chain3," Improper shifting puts strain on your drive train, and your chain can only stretch so far before it slips or potentially breaks. Shifting moves the chain, and if you are cranking on the pedals up a hill this can cause it to miss the teeth of the next gear. Some tips for safe shifting include:


Shift before you get to a hill. Don't wait until you can barely pedal to shift. As a general rule of thumb, your feet should always move at the same speed -- you keep shifting to make this possible.
Use ""soft pressure"" when you shift. Right as you shift, ease up on your feet as if letting go of the gas. You don't want to stop pedaling, you just want less weight on the pedals. Work on timing this with your shift, then resuming normal pedaling., This is common if, when shifting to one of your ""extreme gears"" on the far side of either set of gears, the chain keeps going and slips off. Limit screws tell the derailleur to stop moving in one direction, and if the limit is too high, the chain will keep moving when you shift even though there is no gear to catch it. Both the front and back derailleur have tiny limit screws labeled ""H"" and ""L"" for ""High"" and ""Low"" limits.


Turn the ""H"" screws clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the right, away from the bike.
Turn the ""L"" screws clockwise to prevent the chain from moving to far to the left and into your wheel.If you are in the furthest gear, you will see the derailleur moving as you adjust the screws. Make sure it lines up in the middle of the gear.

, Replacing a chain link is not actually that difficult, though you will need a special chain tool. This small tool pushes a pin out of a link, allowing you to replace it. Buy a replacement link from your local bike shop and a chain tool. Find the broken link by pedaling the bike and watching for links that don't bend as they move through the derailleur. Use your chain tool to punch out the pins on the broken link (the small circular rod in the link) and then use the tool to push the pins of the new one in its place.


Try to get the pins lined up so that nothing sticks out.
Master links are special links that can be added to any chain, and have interlocking grooves to that make them easier to install., With age, both chains and cassettes will wear down due to friction, which means the gear teeth cannot lock firmly into place in the chain. To check the chain, use a ruler to measure a 12"" distance between 12 pins in the chain. The pins are the small circles in the middle of the links when you look at the chain from the side. If the twelfth pin is more than 1/8 off the one-foot mark, you need a new chain.If your chain is covered in rust or the links have trouble moving, it is best to purchase a new chain.
Chains generally wear out faster than cassettes and are much cheaper to replace., Cassettes are harder to diagnose than chains, but if you feel like you need a new one, you likely do. If your chain is constantly skipping over gears, sliding off, or skipping, you likely need a new cassette. Take your bike into the shop if there is any confusion for a personal appraisal.

After cleaning the cassette, look at the gears. Do any of them look more visibly worn down than others? If there is a disparity it is likely time to get a new cassette."

Check the brake pads.,
Check the cables.,
Make sure the caliper moves when the cable pulls on it.,
Watch the caliper to make sure both sides clamp against the bike wheel.",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike1," The first thing you will need to know is if the brake pads are too worn to work effectively. There should be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of rubber (the brake pad) between the clamp and the tire when the caliper is engaged to brake the bike. If the pads are worn out, you will need to replace them.;
, Squeeze the brake handles and make sure the cable moves. If it does not, your cable may be stuck in the cable housing, or the clamp in the handle may be loose.

, Either squeeze the handle and watch the caliper close and open, or have someone else operate it while you watch. If the cable at the brake handle moves, but the end at the caliper does not, the cable may be broken inside the cable housing, and the whole cable assembly will have to be replaced.

, If one side is stuck, you may find that only one pad is engaging the wheel, and this will not give you effective braking. You may need to loosen the bolts that hold the caliper on the bike, and work it in and out to free up the mechanism. Some good light machine oil will help keep these moving parts lubricated.

"
"
Purchase new brake pads.,
Remove the nut and washers from your old brake pads, and pull the pad free from the caliper arm.,
Install the new pads, being careful to keep the pad surface ""true"", or aligned with the tire.",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike2," If you have the make and model of your bike, a Bicycle Shop can probably supply you with the correct brake pads for your bike. There are ""universal"" pads available at discount stores, but these typically only work on inexpensive bikes.

, On most bikes, this can be done without removing the caliper from the bike frame. If the caliper must be removed to allow space to work on it, remove the nut at the top center of the caliper, slide the assembly out, and replace the nut on the stud without allowing the assembly to come apart. This keeps all washers, spacers, and the caliper arms in the correct position while working on it.

, To prevent the pads from squeaking, toe the pads in slightly, so that the trailing edge contacts the wheel first. Make sure the pad height is near the center of the metal rim of you wheel. Pads mounted too low may slide off the rim, causing a dangerous situation, or if they are mounted too high, the pad will rub against the sidewall of the tire, which is also undesirable.

"
"
Lubricate the caliper pivot.

,
Check the adjustment of your brake cables.,
Lubricate the cables.,
Remove the cable from its casing, only if it is very stiff, or difficult to operate.,
Thread the loose end of the cable through the clamp at the end you removed previously, and check the ""free travel"" (the distance the brake lever can be squeezed before the brake contacts the wheel).,
Replace either the cable, or the complete cable assembly if the steps above did not solve the problem of the cable not moving when the brakes are applied.",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike3,", When the brakes are not applied, they should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel rim, and when the lever is squeezed, they should make full contact at about half the distance the lever will travel.

, You may use a lubricant in an aerosol can with a tube to spray oil into the cable housing at the ferrell where the cable enters the housing underneath the brake levers. A light machine oil with a small nozzle similar to ""3 in 1"" Oil, or a special brake cable oil purchased at a bike shop is recommended. WD-40, and similar products may ""wash"" the factory lubricant off the cable, and when they evaporate, there will be very little lubricant residue on the cable.

, This is done by removing the clamp at either the caliper or brake lever, and pulling it out the opposite end. If you remove the cable, use an aerosol solvent (or even WD-40) to flush any dirt or debris from the cable tube while the cable is out. Apply a light coat of lithium grease or machine oil to the cable, and reinstall it if it is not damaged.

, When the brake pads are about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wheel with the lever released, tighten the clamp.

, Buy the same diameter cable, factory fitted, in the same length as the original equipment. Making up the ferrells, cutting the cables to the correct length, and threading cables cut with pliers through the clamps is a difficult chore.

"
"
Check the cable clamps on the underside of your brake levers to be sure they are secure.

,
Lubricate the ""pivot"" pin on the lever handle.

",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike4,","
"
Make sure the calipers are centered over the wheel.

,
Make sure the springs are equally tensioned on each caliper arm.",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike5,", When you squeeze the brake handle, each side of the caliper should advance toward the wheel the same. If one side has more movement than the other, you will need to ascertain the arms are moving freely and well lubricated. Tighten the spring on the side which moves the greatest amount by bending it with a pair of pliers, being careful not to nick the spring or break it.

"
"
Rotate the pedals backward on your bike if it is equipped with coaster brakes.,
Check the brake arm.",How to Fix Brakes on a Bike6," The pedals should only travel 1/4 turn and the brakes should engage. This all occurs inside the rear axle housing, and servicing is not recommended for a novice.

, On ""Bendix"" type coaster brakes, the brake arm is a flat, steel ""arm"" attached to the rear axle opposite from the chain, which is clamped to the lower frame. Look to see if the clamp has become loose, allowing the arm to rotate with the axle. If it has become detached, reclamp the brake arm facing the front of the bike.

Lubricate your bicycle chain.",How to Clean a Bicycle Chain," A kickstand won't likely be good enough to hold your bike in place while you're working on it. A jostle or a bump could knock your bike on the ground and cause damage. You should use a bike stand that securely holds your bike, or you can set your bike upside down on the ground so it rests on the seat and handlebars.


Having your bike oriented wheels upward is a definite bonus. This will make the chain and drivetrain of your bike more accessible, raising it up to a level more comfortable for you to work and inspect.
A bike stand is a simple holder for your bicycle that you can buy or build from scrap parts. It usually consists of hooks attached to a frame. You should hang your bike by the wheels on the hooks, but be careful as you do. Cheap bike stands might not be very sturdy.;
, If you notice your bike chain is excessively dirty and grimy, with a crust of dirt and environmental gook, it's probably time to clean your chain. Regular cyclists will likely want to perform a chain cleaning once every week, or at least once every 200 miles (321 km).








A quick eye inspection should be enough to tell if your chain needs cleaning. However, if you are unsure, feel the chain with your fingers. If it feels as though the chain is caked or that its movement is limited by grime, it's time to clean.Preventative maintenance can prolong the life of your chain and keep your sprockets in good condition. By cleaning your chain regularly, you'll also be aware of changes that happen in your chain over time, like chain stretch or damaged links.While checking the state of your chain, you'll have an excellent opportunity to find the master link for the chain. The master link, like a Connex or SRAM Powerlink link, allows you to easily remove your chain from the drivetrain. Most have a pin/slot configuration where you can slide a small pin out of a slot to open the link and remove the chain.If does not have a master link, you can install one of these yourself or have it done a local bicycle shop. This is usually fairly inexpensive, generally costing around $15 or less.

, Especially if you're inexperienced when it comes to bicycle maintenance, it's important to have a good idea of how the chain functions and how it fits in the drivetrain of your bike. The drivetrain connects the motor, in this case you, to the wheels of your bike. Your chain fits into the drivetrain, transferring the force of your pedaling to the wheels.


More complex/variable gear bikes might have complicated gear-shifting mechanisms at the wheels. You might want to take a few pictures with your cell phone of of these parts so you have a reference when it comes time to reattach your chain., Most of these are household items, but you might have to go to your local bike shop or hardware store to purchase a few, like a quality bicycle chain lubricant. Having your supplies on hand will make this job easier. In all, you'll need:


A clean rag
A quality bike chain lubricant
A quality degreaser
A wire clothes hanger
Gloves (optional)
Two bottles, To clean your chain, you're going to soak it first in a degreaser and then rinse away any remaining grime away with hot water. Fill enough degreaser in one bottle to completely immerse your chain. Do the same for the other bottle with hot water.









For excessively dirty chains, you may want to do a double rinse with your degreaser. To most efficiently do this, prepare another bottle with degreaser in the same fashion as you did the first.
Your first rinse in degreaser will be quick, breaking up heavy grime. The second bottle can be used to soak the chain for deep cleaning.
If you don't have a degreaser formulated for bicycle chains available, you can use an equivalent found in your home, though these might not be as strong or fast acting. Some options include paint thinner, kerosene, and isopropyl alcohol., Since you scoped out the position of your master link while examining your chain, you should be able to easily find it again. Slide the pin holding the link closed out of its slot to open the master link. Once the master link is open, you should be able to easily pull the chain free by feeding it through the drivetrain.









To prevent damage to the shifting mechanisms and sprockets of your bike, use firm but gentle pressure to remove it from the drivetrain. Yanking on your chain to tear it free can do damage to your bike., Put your chain in the bottle containing degreaser and then put the lid on the bottle. Shake the bottle for several minutes to ensure the degreaser breaks up even the thickest, most stubborn film on your chain. For best results, after shaking you should allow your chain to soak for about 20 minutes.









Allow your chain to soak give your degreaser time to work its way into the nooks and crannies between the links of your chain. Soaking also give your degreaser time to break up thick or stubborn grime., To prevent getting your hands and clothes dirty with harsh degreaser, you can use a coat hanger to hook your chain and pull it free of the degreaser bottle. Transfer the chain to the bottle with hot water using your hanger, seal the bottle, and then shake it. After this, you can remove your chain from the bottle.








Once your chain is out of the hot water bottle, you should wipe away any remaining moisture with your rag. Slide your chain through the rag and use your hand to apply pressure it to ensure the chain is free of moisture., There are many different kinds of bicycle, so particulars of how you reattach your chain will be unique to your bike. Use the pictures you took with your phone of the wheel mechanisms to insert your chain into the drivetrain properly.









If you struggle reattaching your chain even when consulting the pictures you took of the drivetrain, its likely you can find a tutorial or manual for your bicycle online. Do a quick Internet search, and use the tutorial/manual to reattach your chain.

, It'll be easiest to reconnect your master link if the ends of your bike chain meet at the midpoint between your wheels. To ensure this, you may want to lay and thread your bike chain into the drivetrain with one end extending to either the top- or bottom-middle point between your wheels.









Slide the pin of your master link back into its slot to complete the master link and reconnect your chain. Feel the master link with your fingers to make sure it is properly fastened. If the link is skewed, sitting unevenly in its slot, it could warp., A good quality lubricant will help your bike chain run smoothly, but will also help protect it from the elements. Hold your bottle of lubricant above the top-middle point of the chain and squeeze out a thin, stead stream, spinning your pedals as you do so to move the chain. When you have completed a full revolution of the chain, your bike chain will be fully lubricated and ready to ride.

Remove the wheel from the bike.,
Inspect the cassette for wear and damage and confirm a cassette replacement is necessary.,
Remove the skewer.,
Place your lockring tool into the center of the cassette.,
Wrap the chain whip around the largest sprocket in a clockwise direction.,
Clamp a large adjustable wrench on your lock ring bolt, holding the chain whip in place.,
Holding the chain whip in place, turn the wrench counter-clockwise to release the lock-ring.,
Slide the cassette off after removing the lock ring.,
Clean the hub of the bike with an old rag and some light cleaning fluid.,

Replace the cassette with a different ratio.,
Slide the cassette back onto the hub of the bike in the order you bought them.,
Tighten the locking nut of the cassette.,
Refit the skewer and put the wheel back on the bike.,
Replace your chain whenever you replace your cassette.",How to Change a Rear Cassette," This is easily done by undoing the skewer or the nuts from the axle, undoing the quick release of the brake and removing the wheel from the bike. Take the wheel off and set the bike aside.








The chain is, more likely than not, around the cassette. If you're struggling to remove it, shift the front gear into the smallest ring. Find where the chain threads through two small wheels on the derailleur arm (the shifting mechanism on your back wheel), and push to put slack in the chain.;
, This is also a good time to give the to check for axle bearings for wear and proper lubrication. If the axle moves, the bearing cones need to be adjusted and you may need to replace the bearings in the axle. A bike shop can do this for you if you so desire. Signs you need a new cassette include:









Skipped or slipping chain while riding.
Issues shifting (Note: Check that your derailleurs are properly adjusted before changing the cassette)
Visibly worn teeth (points are lower are rounder on some gears than others).
Cracked, broken, or warped gears.

, Put the wheel on a flat surface with easy access to the cassette and remove the skewer, which is the long rod running through the center of the wheel. More often than not, the skewer and mating bolt on the other end can be easily screwed off by hand.








, Replace the skewer with a lock ring, which is a large hexagonal bolt attached to a small skewer. It will have a grooved ring on the end that locks it into the cassette. This will be your pressure point to unscrew the cassette.









Some older lock-rings don't have attached skewers. They are meant to replace the bolts on your own skewer, then used like normal. Unscrew the normal ends and put the lockring on your old skewer to use.

, The chain whip keeps the cassette from turning while you unscrew it. It is simply a long handle with a foot of bike chain at the end, which allows it to lock the cassette in place. Wrap as much of the chain as you can around one of the largest gears, going clockwise.









To loosen the bolt later you will need to turn counter-clockwise -- this is the opposing pressure to keep everything steady.
Alternatively, use a length of chain instead.

, If you're just starting out, this might be easier with two people. Tighten the adjustable wrench around the lockring tool so that you can get a lot of power on it.









Make sure the tool is firmly jammed in the cassette. This is easily recognizable by the 12-tooth lock nut on the cassette.

, This nut has a regular thread that needs to be rotated in an anticlockwise direction. It will probably take some force, and may make a loud grinding noise as it is removed. This is because of the locking teeth. While you don't want to break anything, know that this takes a fair amount of force, especially if never done before.









All this takes off is the lock ring, the small, usually silver piece that prevents the cassette from moving.
Set the lock ring aside in a careful place -- you definitely do not want to lose these!

, Usually, it consists of a few sprockets, spacers, and a large set of sprockets riveted together. Keep everything in the same order you took it out in as a guide for adding your new cassette. There may also be a plastic chain guard between your cassette and the spokes of the wheel -- it can be kept or discarded.








Some teeth may slide off alone, and some may be pinned together.
You may need to use a thin object to lightly pry a few gears off.

, You rarely get to this area when cleaning, so take the time to get the gunk out now. Use an old rag and some rubbing alcohol, gentle dish soap and warm water, or Simple Green.








, Count the number of teeth on the smallest gear, then the largest one. Put these numbers together to get your ratio. For example, an 11-32 should be replaced with another 11-32. You can find the tooth counts stamped on the sprockets. A part number or name would be useful as well. You can easily bring your cassette into a bike shop as well to get a near identical cassette.








, Most cassettes are interchangeable within brands. For example, Shimano sprockets (gears) can be mixed with other Shimano sprockets. Even older sprockets can be used with some adjustments. To get sprockets, buy them separately or as a whole unit. Cassettes can be disassembled by removing the pins holding them together, the pins have no other purpose than to make assembly easier. Then just stack together the cassette with the gear ratios you want. Some sprocket tooth counts are less common than others, keep that in mind when buying as you might end up with sprockets identical to what you've already got.









Note that changing gear ratios could require a longer or shorter chain to fit on new sized sprockets.

, Put your new cassette on just like you took off the old one. Note that there are a set of smaller teeth on the hub that the cassette slides into. One of them is bigger/smaller than the others. On the cassette, one of the openings is this same size, telling you how to line the new cassette up with the hub. Immediately slide the lock ring on to keep things from moving.









You may need to add some gears one at a time. If they are separated, note any spacers (small, plastic rings) in between them when you buy the cassette. These must go on in order.


, Use the chain whip as described before, but put it on clockwise this time. Then use the wrench to gently tighten the bolt. Never over tighten this as the threads are very small and won't take much force. The cassette is fitted with locking teeth to stop it coming off, giving it the distinctive grinding or zipping sound as it is removed and replaced.









Hand tighten the bolt as much as possible, then use the wrench to just tighten it a hair more so it doesn't move.
The gears should all move together -- there should be no play or wobble in any of the sprockets.

, Once the cassette is back on, put the wheel on the bike and refit the chain. You're ready to ride again.









Always put the bike chain back near the gear the bike is in so that it doesn't clank violently when you start pedaling. If confused, shift the bike all the way to one side of the gears and put the chain on the furthest two rings on that side.

, As chains wear down, the cause more and more stress on the rear cassette. In fact, proper chain replacement (every six months or so for regular riders) is the best thing you can do to prevent replacing your cassette too often. If you put a new cassette on, even if it is identical to the old one, you should replace the chain as well for the best results.

If you don't have one, check if your local bike shop or outdoor store has a ""maintenance night,"" where you pay a small fee to access to all of their tools for the night.


You can also turn the bike upside down, resting it on the seat and handlebars. If you do, however, know that you will have to reverse the direction you spin things in the following instructions.;
, Derailleurs are the machines that physically shift your gears and keep your chain in place. There is one on the back wheel attached to the cassette (the collection of gears) and another smaller derailleur near the pedals. Check that there is nothing in the derailleurs or gears like leafs, sticks, or mud, and clean them with a damp cloth.


The rear derailleur is the more complex machine, consisting of the derailleur, an arm, and 1-2 smaller gears that the chain is threaded through. A cable pulls this arm back and forth, allowing the the chain to switch gears.
The front derailleur is clamped onto your bike's frame, and consists of a spring and two ""derailleur plates,"" or small metal walls that force the chain to stay on only one gear at a time.

, Using one hand to lightly pedal the bike, shift through each gear slowly, starting with every gear on the back derailleur. Go up every gear once and down every gear once. Note places where the gears have trouble shifting, where the chain slips off the gear, or where you need to shift twice to make the bike shift.


While testing one derailleur, put the other one in the middle gear. For example, if I am testing the back derailleur and I have 3 gears in the front, leave the front derailleur in the middle ring the entire time. This prevents the chain from stretching.

, Follow the cables leading to the derailleurs to find the adjusters, which look like little nuts or barrels surrounding the cables. There may be two for each cable -- one at the derailleur end and another by the handlebars. These make small adjustments to the derailleur cables, allowing you to make subtle changes to your shifting.

, While pedaling the bike with one hand, shift your gears up until your get to a problem, such as if the chain won't shift, has trouble staying on the gear, or skips a gear. Stop shifting when you find an issue, but keep your bike in that gear.

, If you have trouble shifting as you lower your gears (lower gears are closer to the wheel), then loosen the cable adjuster by turning it counterclockwise. Turn the adjuster slowly, turning until the chain falls into the correct gear.


Always work slowly, adjusting by a quarter-turn at a time at most.
Think of it as of turning the adjuster the way you want the chain to move. Rotate towards the bike to make the chain move towards the bike.

, If your bike struggles to work it's way up the gears (away from your bike), you should tighten the cable adjuster by turning it clockwise. When it is correct, the chain will naturally switch to the correct gear on it's own.


Think of this as turning the adjuster the way you want the chain to move. Rotate away from the bike to make the chain move away the bike.

, Once you've successfully adjusted the problems, cycle through every gear again to make sure that the derailleur can successfully shift through every gear.


You want the chain to flow smoothly from gear to gear every time you shift.

, Sometimes the bike will behave differently under your weight. In a parking lot or driveway, ride the bike around and cycle through any gears. Note any problems and adjust your cables accordingly.

Bolt the cable back to the derailleur.,
Use the cable adjusters to adjust your gears properly.",How to Adjust Bike Gears2," You need to be able to spin the wheels freely without the bike moving. The best way to to this is with a bike stand. If you don't have one, check if your local bike shop or outdoor store has a ""maintenance night,"" where you pay a small fee to access to all of their tools for the night.


You can also turn the bike upside down, resting it on the seat and handlebars. If you do, however, know that you will have to reverse all of the following instructions.

, On the rear derailleur, this is the small gear furthest from the bike. On the front derailleur it is the small gear closest to the bike.


Shift the derailleur you are not working on to a gear somewhere in the middle.

, This is found at the end of the cable leading from your handlebars to your derailleur. A small bolt clamps the cable in place, holding it tight. Using an Alan key, unscrew the bolt to free the end of the cable.



Advanced Note: You'll notice that, if you pedal the bike, the chain will slide down to the lowest ring without your help. That is because derailleurs work by tightening the cable to hold the chain in place. Similarly, you can shift your bike manually by pulling the cable.

, In order to prevent your chain from slipping off, the derailleur is contained to the small area between the gears. There are two small screws which hold the derailleur in place, located right next to each other on the top (front derailleur) or back (rear derailleur) of the derailleur.


The screw on the left, often labeled with an ""H,"" limits how high, or near the bike, the chain can go.
The screw on right, often labeled with an ""L,"" limits how low, or away from the bike, the chain can go.

, The screws are simple to adjust -- if your chain is falling off the right side of the front derailleur, then tighten to the front right screw to limit it. Each screw corresponds to the side it adjusts, and tightening the screw (turning-clockwise) will limit the derailleur from going too far to that side.

, If the derailleur pushes too far the chain will fall off the gears and towards the wheel. Alternatively, it may not push far enough, and the chain will not get to all the gears. You can then adjust the limit screws to move the derailleur -- and you will actually see it moving.



Tighten the left screw if you the chain goes too far. This will keep the derailleur from moving too much to the left.

Loosen the left screw if you cannot shift into every gear. This will allow the derailleur to move farther in.

, With the chain on the smallest gear, tighten or loosen the left (H) limit screw so that the chain doesn't touch the derailleur plate.


Shoot for 2-3 millimeters of space on each side of the chain., Shift back down to the lowest gears and pull the cable tight by hand -- it does not need to be perfect, just taut -- then screw the cable back in place underneath the bolt on the derailleur you removed it from.


Often, you can see an indent in the cable indicating where it was bolted before.

, Make sure your bike can shift comfortably to and from every gear in the front and back, and use your cable adjusters to make changes where necessary.

Pull the broken link off the pin and discard.,
Thread the chain back onto the bike the way it came off.,
Fit the two end of the chain into one another so the holes line up.,
Use your chainbreak tool in reverse to push the pin through, completing the link.,
Grab the chain on each side of your newly connected links and move it from side to side to loosen up the new connection.,
Lubricate your chain with bike grease.,
Avoid using your biggest gear in the back gears, as the chain is now a link too short.",How to Fix a Broken Bicycle Chain1," Note how it moves in and out of the pulley wheels, if there are any. Chains wrap around the derailleur (shifting device in the back of the bike) in a particular, but not difficulty to understand, patter you'll need to replicate later. Some chains are simply threaded on the gear.


If you work carefully you won't even need to remove the chain from the bike. But, depending where the link broke, there is a chance it slips off while cleaning or fixing. Take a quick picture now.;
, The broken chain won't move, but the bike will be in soft, easy gears when you get it back on, as the extreme gears are the ones that tend to cause the chain to snap if it is weak.


If you only have one set of gears on this bike, you'll need a new chain link to proceed. The following method shortens the chain by a link, meaning it likely won't fit on your gears when finished., Use a toothbrush to get into the chainlinks, scrubbing off grime, rust, and dirt. A dirty chain is under much more stress than a clean one, and is much more primed to break. Clean it so that the chain links can move freely in your hands, paying attention specifically to any ""stuck"" or slow moving links. Clean the chain now to prevent fixing it again shortly.


If, even after cleaning, the chain is still rusty and stiff, you'll likely need a new chain. A rough, stiff chain can even damage your gears and derailleurs if left on for too long.

, This tool, resembling a medieval torture device, is actually easy to use. Each link has two round pins in it, attaching it to the other links. Find the broken link, and note the pin that is keeping it attached to the rest of the chain. Slowly turn your chain break tool so the poker pushes the pin out of the link about halfway. Do not push it completely through.


If you have a spare pin (many chainbreakers come with one), then you should feel free to use this pin, as it will be much stronger and safer to ride on., Keep the pin still in the rest of the chain. You only want to remove the broken link, keeping the pin in the chain. This pin will attach to the open link on the other side of the chain to put everything back together., Before you fix the link, you need to get the chain onto the bike! Slide it through the pulley wheels they way you noted when you took the chain off. In general, the order is pretty intuitive, as there are small metal guards that hold the chain onto the gears. Simply thread the chain so that it stays between these guards and the pulley wheels.


To make pushing the pin in easier, turn the chain so that the exposed pin in the chain faces you, not the wheel., The link with the pin in it should be on the outside, so that you can push it through all four holes (two on each link) to complete your chain.

, Before, you screwed the tool in to push the pin out of the link. Now you'll be screwing the tool in to push the link though. Work slowly, keeping your hand on the links to ensure it is all lined up.

, It can also help to move the chain tool to the other side of the joint just made, and push the pin very slightly to free the two outside plates of the link from the central section, preventing binding.

, Do not use WD-40, or any other product not made for bike chains. Flip the bike over and pedal it with one hand, dropping bits of lubricant onto the chain with the other. 10-15 drops should do. Then, use a damp rag and lightly pat down the chain of any excess oil. When you run a finger on the chain it should come up slick, but not covered in a puddle of lubricant.

, More often than not, the bike won't even let you get into these gears, as the chain is not long enough to reach. However, the strain of trying to hit these bigger cogs will cause another break if you aren't careful.


Try to keep your chain straight between the front and back gears. Don't let it stretch diagonally across the gears by being all the way to the right on the front gears and all the way to the left on the back gears at the same time.
This chain fix is generally temporary, and you should add a new link or get a new chain shortly afterward."
"
Add a new link as soon as possible to return your chain to its normal length.,
Face the master link the right direction.,
Pinch the links together to unhook the two halves of the master link.,
Take each half and push it through the whole on opposite ends of the chain.,
Bring the chain together and link the exposed pins through the figure-eight holes on the opposing links.,
Use a pair of pliers to push the master link together, clicking the pins into place.,
Know that, in the end, a broken chain usually means you need a brand new one.",How to Fix a Broken Bicycle Chain2," If your chain breaks, you can remove the broken link and reattach the chain for a temporary fix. However, the shorter chain won't be able to fit around all of your gears, severely limiting your range. You can purchase new links, however, at any bike shop and many sport retailers



Master Links are made to fit easily onto any bike, anywhere. They are easy to install quickly, too, making them handy to keep in your saddle bag on long trips. They are, by far, the most common links used by home mechanics.

, Most links have an arrow on them that needs to point in the direction the chain goes when pedaling. The rest are concave (bending in) on one side, and this side needs to face towards the wheel and the rest of the bike., You'll notice that the master link has a figure-eight shaped space for the pins, instead of the normal rounded pins and pin-holes for the rest of the chain. If the chain is not already unlocked, do it now.


Some master links come as two asymmetrical halves -- a C-shaped piece with both pins and an outside plate. To fix these chains, simply thread the C-shaped pin into the both open holes of the broken chain, then fit the plate on top.

, Each of the pins on the two halves of the master link needs to go into one of the ends of the chain. Make sure that the pins go in from opposite sides of the chain as well. You are going to hook the chain back together using the figure-eight hole, and they need to line up.

, It's as easy as pushing the pins through the wholes. Note, however, that this connection is currently very loose.


Some mechanics use a tensioner, a simple C-shaped wire that hooks into the grooves of the chain, to hold it taut while linking. While not necessary, a set of hands or a similar tool to keep the chain close together makes life much easier.

, You want to force the pins into the other sides of the figure-eight hole to lock them in place. If you don't have a pair of pliers handy, there is one more trick to tighten everything. Flip the bike over so it's upside-down. Holding the back break down, slowly pedal the bike. As the brake holds the wheel, and thus the chain, in place, the pressure of pedaling will pull the other side, tightening your master link., While you can fix the chain in a variety of ways, as noted, a broken chain usually needs a replacement. Beyond breaking, old chains expand as the pins inside wear down. This might not sound like much in theory, but it matters when riding. The chain handles and transfers all of the force from your feet to the wheels, and a loose chain means you're doing a lot more work for a lot less speed."
"
Find the slippage.,
Use the quick release if the chain is jammed.,
Loosen the chain if your bike has a rear derailleur.,
Turn the pedals on a bike without a derailleur.,
Pedal forward gently until the bike is in the right gear.,
Perform some final checks.",How to Put On a Bicycle Chain1," Sometimes, while riding, the chain will slip off of its intended path, but not break. Because, in this case, the chain is still routed through both the front and rear derailleurs, no special maintenance is needed - all you'll usually need to do is slip the chain back onto its sprocket. When you experience a slippage, get off the bike and look for the slippage. Usually, the chain falls off of the front sprocket, but stays threaded through both derailleurs.


Look for places where the chain has become jammed against the frame - these jams must be addressed before the bike can be ridden again.;
, Sometimes, in the event of a slippage, the chain gets jammed between the rear sprocket and the frame. In this case, it's a good idea to loosen the quick release on the rear wheel and undo the wheel nut to loosen the rear wheel from the chain. When you've loosened the rear wheel enough, simply pull the chain out.


Open the quick release by first pulling the small lever at the center of the rear wheel. Then, loosen the wheel nut on the other side to loosen the ""hold"" the rear wheel has on the frame. Once loosened, the chain should come out easily.
Don't forget to re-tighten the quick release before riding away. You should be able to close it completely - it should be tight, but not too tight to push all the way down. If it feels too tight, loosen the wheel nut and try again. Likewise, if it's too loose, then tighten the wheel nut.

, For bikes with rear derailleurs, simply slacken the chain and thread it around the front sprocket. On most bikes, the rear derailleur is spring loaded so that it keeps the chain tight while riding. Take advantage of this fact by pushing the arm of the rear derailleur forward to introduce slack in the chain. Then, use this slack to thread the other end of the chain around the smallest of the front sprockets. Release the arm of the rear derailleur and ensure the chain is tight.


From here, you can usually simply ride away! Your bike may shift somewhat erratically until the chain shifts into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred.

, For bikes without a derailleur, catch the chain on the sprocket by pedaling. Many bikes (like ""fixies"") don't have derailleurs. The easiest way to repair a loose chain in this case is to hook the chain onto the rear sprocket, hook as much of the chain as you can on the bottom of the front sprocket, and carefully turn the pedal backwards. The chain should ""catch"" and begin to turn around the front sprocket. When the ""caught"" portion gets to the top of the front sprocket, the chain should begin running through the bike's gears as normal.


Turning the pedals is easier if you elevate the bike's rear wheel. To do so, you can put the bike on a stand or prop up the rear of the frame with any materials on hand. Alternatively, you may get a helper to hold the rear wheel off the ground as you put the chain back on or turn the entire bike upside down.

, Get on your bike and pedal forward at a slow speed. If your bike has gears, your chain may ""jump"" back into the gear it was in when the slippage occurred. Otherwise, keep changing gear until the chain pedals smoothly.


Note - on fixed-gear bikes, chain slippage can be particularly dangerous and problematic and is often the symptom of a chain that's too loose. Consider adjusting the tension in your chain before riding again.

, Before you resume normal riding, make sure you are in a comfortable gear. If your bike has them, change gears on both the rear and front derailleurs until your chain turns smoothly without producing any noise.

Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain.",How to Change a Chain on a Mountain Bike," It's unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over. A bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well, but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars.Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on.
You can make a simple bike rack with scrap parts. All you'll need are hooks and a frame. Insert hooks into 2 x 4 boards oriented vertically and attach those boards to a sturdy base, separating each board by the distance between the hubs of the wheels.;
, A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master link are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother.


If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases.
If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, you can use a special tool called a chain-tool to remove the chain., This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between wheels will be easiest.


If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool., Bike chains are greased to improve their performance and prevent the elements from causing the chain the degrade quickly. It's likely that a layer of gunk has accumulated on your chain. Clean this with a rag that's been dampened with degreaser and wipe free the buildup and grease.


To gain access to the full length of chain, move the pedals with your hands to rotate it through the drivetrain until an uncleaned section of chain is available.
If you lack chain degreaser, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) or paint thinner both work well as a substitute. , Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. With a master link, you can do this by squeezing both ends of the master link inwards with your hands or a pair of small pliers so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If using a chain tool, you should:


Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link.
Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain.
You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged.
Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it., Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones.Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.

, It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one.


Count the number of links your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove.
If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike., For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at either the top or bottom midpoint between your wheels.


Positioning the ends of your chain at the midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible, which will make the reattachment easier., With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link.


You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place.
If you were not able to measure and shorten your chain beforehand, you should notice that your chain hangs somewhat loosely in your drivetrain. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear., If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain.


When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much., As your suspension compresses, the chain of your bike will adjust. This can cause chain binding and make your bike difficult to ride. Take your bike off its rack and then:


Vent the compression element from your shock or disengage it. This can usually done with the press of a button on the shocks of your bike.
Bike shocks are generally be located on the front frame of your bike around where the frame of your bike forks to the wheel.
Press down on the seat of your bike firmly until the suspension is fully engaged. When your bike can compress no further, your suspension is fully engaged.
If your chain remains taut, your bike is good to go. If, however, you notice the chain loosens, you'll likely have to remove another link or two. If it resists the compression of your bike's suspension, you may need to add a link., Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers.


To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.

, The most reliable way of doing this is with a chain wear indicator, which you should be able to purchase at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading.


Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values.
If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn., If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:


Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur.
Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly., The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfer the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.


You might want to snap a few pictures of the gear mechanism(s) on your bike with your phone before removing the chain. You can consult these pictures later on, if you're having difficulty reattaching the chain."

Adjust the back derailleur into the middle cog, then test your shifting in the front.",How to Adjust a Front Bicycle Derailleur1," Your goal is for the front derailleur to sit comfortably above the chains, with the outside plate 2-3 millimeters above the largest chain ring. It will be aligned so that it curves parallel to the chain rings. It should sit parallel with the chain. If the derailleur is rubbing up against a ring or is caught on something, do not ride the bike. Instead, move on to ""Resetting your Front Derailleur"" below., Flip the bike over so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Shift the front derailleur up and down while pedaling with your hand. Can it get to all 2-3 gears? Is there clicking, rubbing, or grinding? Make a note of any problem areas and remember them as you move through your adjustments.


If you have a bike stand then use this for your adjustments -- it makes repairs much easier.

The rear derailleur needs to be correctly adjusted before continuing, so check it if it is shifting incorrectly.

, Make sure the chain is on the middle cog at the back and the smallest chainring in front. This ensures that the chain isn't stretched diagonally and loosens the derailleur cable so that it is easier to manage.

, Right above the derailleur is a thin cable, clamped in place by a bolt or screw. It is usually attached to the bike frame (the metal skeleton of the bike). Grip the top of the cable and pull up on it, then loosen the bolt. Pull the cable up so that it is tight, then retighten the bolt again. This will clamp the bolt down on the cable so it can't move.


This may move the derailleur slightly, but you'll be adjusting it again in a minute. Right now you want to make sure that your derailleur cable is tight so that the whole thing functions smoothly., There are two small screws on the top or sides of your derailleur, one labeled ""L"" and the other ""H."" They are likely not entirely screwed in, and poke slightly up and out of the derailleur. These are your Low and High limit screws, and they control how far to the left or right your derailleur can move. They are adjusted with a normal Phillips (""star"" or ""plus sign "" ""+"") screwdriver.The L controls how far towards your bike the derailleur can go. The H controls how far out and away from your bike it can go.
If your screws aren't labeled, you can easily test them out. Shift into your smallest ring up front. Turn one screw a full turn in each direction, watching the derailleur. If it moves, this is the Lower (L) limit, if it does not, try the other one. When this one moves, mark it with an L for future reference., Shift into the smallest chainring in the front and the largest in the back so that the chain is completely to the left. Turn the L screw so that the derailleur has 2-3mm of space on either side of the chain.


You should see the derailleur move as you turn the screw.

, Pedal the bike and shift the front to the biggest cog and the back to the smallest gear. The chain should be complete to the right on the bike. Turn the H limit screw until the derailleur is 2-3mm on either side of the chain so that it has plenty of space to move., Shift the back gears to something in the middle so that it doesn't pull your chain either way as you shift. Then, pedal the bike and shift up and down through the front derailleur, making sure that you don't have any issues. Adjust the limit screws as necessary, and have fun riding.Setting your limits too far to either side can cause the derailleur to slip off, but you should be able to see if it is this far before you start testing.

You will also need a replacement pin to connect the new chain, but this should come with the new bike chain.


You can purchase these items in a sporting goods store or cycling shop.

, Stop and lay your bike on its side with the sprocket-up. If the chain is still on your bike, then look for the break in your chain. If the chain is hanging loose from the sprocket, then it should be easy to find the two separated ends of the chain. If the chain has fallen off completely, then you can just start to put on the new chain. For most bike chains, each link is connected to the next by passing a metal pin through the outer ""plate"" portion of one link and through the inner ""roller"" portion of the adjacent link. Most bike chains fall into one of three categories:Chains with special replacement pins. These chains require a special type of pin from the manufacturer (usually provided when you buy the chain) to repair a break. If you don't carry these special pins with you when you go riding, you may be out of luck in terms of repair options until you can make it to a bike shop.
Chains with master links. These chains have a special link with two pins that is used to join the two ends of the chain. If this link is broken, you may need to wait until you can replace it to be able to repair the chain.
Chains with ""normal"" pins. Older, more traditional chains have uniform pins, any of which can be used to repair a breakage (provided you have a chain tool with you).

, If you've decided that your chain will be easier to replace than to repair, the first thing you'll need to do is get rid of the old chain. If the chain has completely split, simply turn the pedals until the length of the chain has passed around the sprocket and can be removed. If the chain is still holding together, you may need to introduce a break in the chain so that it's easier to remove. You can do this with a chain tool.


To use a standard chain tool, simply line up one chain link in the tool's internal groove, securing it on the tool's ""teeth"", then turn the chain tool's handle to drive the tool's point down and push the pin out of the chain. If you want to reuse your chain, make sure you only push the pin far enough out of the way that the two links can be separated. Don't push the pin all the way out, as they're quite hard to replace.
Once you've introduced a break in the chain, simply turn the pedals to pass the broken chain through the bike's gears. Ideally, you want to buy a replacement chain that's the exact same length as the chain you had before (though bikes with a rear derailleur allow a small margin of error), so now is a good time to count the links in your chain. You should also make note of the type of drivetrain you have, as this determines which chains are suitable. For example, 9-speed drivetrains require 9-speed chains, and so on.

, Next, thread the new chain through your rear derailleur. You may need to turn the back wheel, which is much easier to do if it's not on the floor. If you have a bike rack or hanging hook on the wall of your garage that allows you to hang the bike with its sprockets facing you, use it. If not, you may want to simply prop up the rear of the bike's frame with wood, boxes, cinder blocks, or whatever else you have lying around.


Also, make note of your derailleur arrangement. If your rear derailleur has a cable connected to your shifting mechanism, shift into the highest gear. If the front derailleur has a cable connected, shift into the lowest gear., A bike's rear derailleur is the spring-loaded system of gears hanging down below the main rear sprocket on most modern bikes with gears. Threading the chain through this derailleur properly is essential for smooth, safe riding. Take the ""female"" end (i.e., the end of the chain without a pin sticking out) of your properly-sized replacement chain and thread it around the bottom pulley, then up and around the top pulley. When done correctly, your chain should make a smooth, straight, backwards ""S-shaped"" path through the derailleur. Make sure the chain isn't catching or resting on anything besides the pulleys - if so, there will be a bump in your backwards ""S"".


There may be a small metal ""tab"" between the two small pulleys in your derailleur. The chain must pass this tab without rubbing on it.
Some bikes, like fixed-gear bikes (""fixies"") and bikes with a hub gear shifting mechanism, don't have a derailleur. In these cases, simply thread the chain onto the rear sprocket as directed in the next step, turning the wheel as needed.

, On bikes with gears, the cassette is simply the array of multiple sprockets attached to the rear wheel of the bike. When the chain is properly threaded through the derailleur, pull it up and over the smallest sprocket in the cassette. Make sure the chain is tight and properly threaded through the rear derailleur and onto the sprocket, then pull it through to give yourself some slack at the lead end of the chain.

, Most modern bikes with gears have a metal mechanism near the front sprocket that moves to shift the chain from one front gear to another. Thread the lead end of your chain through this front derailleur, turning the rear wheel to give yourself more slack as needed.


Again, ""fixie"" bikes usually won't have a front derailleur, so simply thread the chain around the front sprocket as detailed in the next step.

, Align your chain with the smallest of the front sprockets. Stretch it taught so that it engages securely with the teeth on the front sprocket, then pull it around the sprocket, turning the pedals as necessary to give yourself enough slack.

, Finally, once your chain securely passes all the way through your gear system, you can join the two ends of the chain and start riding again. Line up the ""female"" and ""male"" ends of the chain in a chain tool (again, available at all bike shops). Be sure that the two ends of the chain rest securely in the groove of the tool, hooked on to the ""teeth"" of the tool. Turn the handle to drive the pin into the chain, connecting the two links. Make sure the pin protrudes an equal distance from each side of the link, as even a minor misalignment can cause structural weakness in the chain, potentially leading to another repair.


One useful tip is to use a small, thin piece of metal called a ""C-hook"" to hold the two ends of the chain near each other. This makes it much easier to work, as you won't have to worry about holding the chain in place yourself and potentially losing either end. In a pinch, a bent paperclip can substitute for a real C-hook.

"
"
Know that you need to reset your derailleur if it is hitting the chain rings, bent, or angled awkwardly.,
Shift to your leftmost rings.,
Loosen the barrel adjusters to relieve cable tension.,
Lightly unclamp the bolt holding the derailleur cable in place.,
Carefully undo the bolts clamping the derailleur to the bike frame.,
Gently move the derailleur into the correct place.,
Readjust your cable and limit screws.",How to Adjust a Front Bicycle Derailleur2," The limit screws are only going to fix so much if the derailleur is in need of serious adjustments. If you feel the derailleur hitting chain rings, notice that it is angled, or see that it is too high, you'll have to reset the derailleur and start again.

, Shift to the smallest ring in the front and the largest in the back. You may need to put the bike on a stand or turn it upside down to easily pedal and shift at once.

, Barrel adjusters are at the end of your derailleur cable, near the handle bars. To find them, follow the front derailleur cable as far as it goes until you get to a small, spinnable cylinder. Turn this clockwise as far as it goes.Count the number of rotations you make on the barrel. You'll want to return it back into approximately the same position when you're done.

, Above the derailleur is a cable that runs all the way to your shifter. It is held in place by a small bolt that prevents it from moving or sliding. Undo this bolt enough that the cable can move freely if pulled but doesn't just slide out on it's own., You do not want this to move seriously, as any major movements will change your entire alignment. Undo the bolts just enough so that you can wiggle and shift the derailleur's position.

, If the derailleur is angled, twist it so that it is parallel to the chain, being careful not to change the height. If it is touching the top of the chain ring, move it up a few millimeters so that it sits above the biggest cog. Your goals are:


1-3mm above the largest chain ring. You should be able to snugly fit a penny between the outer plate of the derailleur and the teeth of the ring.
Both plates parallel to the chain.
Curve of derailleur matches the curve of the cogs., Once you've made your changes, you'll need to readjust the derailleur so that it runs smoothly. To do so, pull the cable taut and then reclamp it underneath the bolt. Then adjust your limit screws as described in Method 1.


Be sure to lube your chain and keep it clean for the best shifting.
Be sure to retighten your barrel adjusters too.

Replace your car's bulbs as needed.,
Test your vehicle's refrigerant levels (also known as freon) once a year.,
Replace your car's transmission fluid as recommended in the owner's manual.,
Wash your car regularly to remove build-up on the exterior.","How to Maintain a Car at 50,000 Miles"," The best or youngest tires should go on the front of your vehicle. When rotating tires from the back to the front, its important to keep tires on the same side of the car.;
, Always have your car professionally aligned when you change your tires.

,, Before working with a battery, remove any metal objects, such as a ring or watch, which can cause a spark.

, The battery load is how much electricity the battery can store without having to be recharged. This is particularly important if your battery is more than 2 years old.

, Use the fluid brand recommended by your owner's manual. If you need to fill more than 2 ounces of brake fluid, consider getting the brakes inspected for leaks and wear by a mechanic. You may need a complete flush and re-fill.


If you do need a flush and re-fill, have the mechanic check your vehicle's brake pads and brake shoes, as well.

, If you find any, replace all of the hoses at once.

, If you need more than 2 ounces, take it to a mechanic to be checked for leaks. Have the mechanic flush out the old power steering fluid and replace it.

, Since should get an oil and oil filter change every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km), as well, you can check your wipers at the same time. Make sure to measure your blades before replacing them so you know which size to get.

, You may want to check your lights at every oil change.

, Low freon can decrease your car's performance and cause damage to its air compressors. Only a trained professional can add freon to your vehicle since it is a high-pressured gas.

, Your manual should also tell you what type of transmission fluid and filter to use. Some vehicle models may require a special additive, as well.

, Use soap designated for cars. Do not use dish or other household soaps, as these can deteriorate your vehicle's paint. Wax your car every other year.

Read the owner's manual and take its recommendations to heart.,
Take a look under the hood yourself.,
Adhere to a service schedule.,
Keep an ear out for troubling noises.","How to Maintain a Car at 100,000 Miles"," Take a more conservative approach to the car's maintenance schedule if your car is over 100,000 miles (160,000 km).;
,

Locate the coolant tank. If the coolant level is too high, visit a service technician. If it's too low, add coolant when the engine is cool. You'll also want to check the coolant's color. It should be either a bright orange or green, depending on the brand. If it looks more like rust, have that looked at as well.






Check the oil to make sure it's never too low.







,

Examine tire pressure and check that your lights are working correctly every month. You should check tire pressure with a quality pressure gauge, particularly before you go on a long trip.






Change the oil every 3,000 to 4,000 miles (4,800 to 6,400 km), or even every three to four months. Use a high-mileage oil, which will help an aging engine.






While getting the oil changed, ask the technician to inspect belts and hoses. It's important to be current with belt maintenance as they do not give notice before they fail and possibly destroy your engine. Hoses should be carefully inspected for any breaks or wear and replaced immediately when a problem is detected.






If you haven't already done so, replace the engine timing belt. You should do this every 60,000 and 100,000 miles (97,000 and 161,000 km) or between five and eight years.






Every other oil change, or every 6,000 miles (9,700 km), have the tires rotated, the wheels balanced and the brakes examined. Make sure the car's wheel bearings are checked regularly and replaced as they wear.






Replace both fuel and air filters if you have not already done so. You should do this between 24,000 and 100,000 miles (39,000 and 161,000 km).






Have your vehicle's cooling system flushed and refilled, maintenance that should occur between 40,000 and 100,000 miles (64,000 and 161,000 km). Some professionals say that coolant should be changed every two years because the coolant loses its effectiveness over time.






Have your mechanic check the car's engine compression routinely. A compression check can indicate problems with piston rings or valves. If the engine's compression is too high, it can result in engine damage.






Run a heater and air conditioner check annually.






Test your battery quarterly, as a wearing battery can cause other damage--to the alternator or starter--and result in extensive repairs. Replace your battery every five or six years and keep an eye on it when the warranty period ends.







, Most of the time, you'll be able to hear when your car isn't running well. Be in tune with your car's normal sounds and alert a mechanic to anything out of the ordinary.

Establish a simple plan of attack.,
Tires.,
Oil.,
Windows.,
Brakes, belts, and battery.,
Interior.,
Fluids.,
Lights.,
Windshield wipers.,
Emission control systems.",How to Maintain a Car," One way to think of this is to use the acronym T.O.W.B.I.F., which stands for Tires, Oil, Windows, Brakes, Interiors, and Fluids. Use your owner's manual to establish a schedule for your car.;
, Make sure they are properly inflated to the manufacturer's specified pressure. Tire gauges are cheap and easy to use. Tires should be replaced when tread wear indicators are showing between the treads. Ask your local tire dealer if you are unsure how to identify tread wear indicators. Check your tires every other day for pressure and every week for wear or damage. Have them replaced when they become worn beyond acceptable limits.

, Oil is the blood of your car, and without it, the car isn't going to go far or quietly. Have your mechanic demonstrate how to check your oil properly, and have the oil changed every 3,000 – 3,500 miles. While oil manufacturers have claimed that their oil can last 10,000 miles, it is generally best to use the same oil for no more than 5,000 miles to maximize engine reliability and efficiency over the long term. Check the oil regularly, about once a week, and change the oil or have it changed when you reach the 4,000–4,500 mile (6,400–7,200 km) limit.

, Make sure that all windows, mirrors and lights are clean and not broken. Replace any broken lights or mirrors as soon as possible. Have small windshield cracks by a windshield repair center to determine whether the windshield can be repaired or needs to be replaced. Check regularly for cracks and damage.


Allow plenty of room if when following behind other vehicles that could throw objects from the road or loose debris from their loads. Even a small pebble from the back of a gravel truck can damage your windshield.

,

The braking systems of modern cars are designed to be replaced periodically to maintain maximum braking efficiency. If you notice ANY problems with the brakes, take your car to have the brakes checked immediately. If the brakes fail, you can have a very serious crash.






Check the belts or have them checked regularly for wear and tension. Very loose belts often make a loud squealing sound; have yours serviced if you hear this noise.






Check the battery once per month for corrosion and clean it or have it cleaned and as needed. Avoid running your battery down, if possible. Even with a jump start, it's hard on the battery. Batteries do eventually get old. If you must replace your battery, also check the alternator to make sure that it is still functioning properly.







, Clean and vacuum the interior as needed. The interior is often a point of selling power when it comes time to trade the car in or sell it. While many may not care about the oil or tires, if the CD player won't work, or the interior looks a little dirty, the deal is off. It's been said that the value of the car is held in the cabin, and that statement holds true. If you ever want to trade the car in or sell it, every quarter spent at a pay vacuum will be paid back to you with interest!

, The other lifeblood of the car are the fluids that the drive train must have. Coolant, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, windshield washer fluid, brake fluid, and other fluids need to be checked at a minimum of once per week. Ask your mechanic to demonstrate the method to check these.

, You can check your own lights if you have someplace you can park near reflective glass windows, or you can ask a friend to walk around your car while you turn on different lights. Make sure to check your headlights, taillights, reverse lights, brake lights, and turn signals.


Notice where your headlights point and correct it or have it corrected as needed. They should be pointing down and towards the outside of the road, not straight out, up, or towards the center. You can see the light pattern on the road ahead of you. Misaligned headlights can be distracting or hazardous to drivers ahead of you or in oncoming or adjacent lanes. If they are too low, this could limit the distance you can see while driving at night.







, It's not difficult to replace worn wiper blades yourself. Replace just the blades once a year as needed before the rainy season. You can also replace the entire wiper assembly if needed. If you do a lot of driving in wet weather conditions, you may also want to apply a water repellent treatment to your windshield.

, Depending on where you live, you may be required to get your car checked for emissions periodically. This is usually part of the MOT inspection. Generally, a professional must perform the diagnosis. Oxygen sensors and EGR valves are two common culprits .

Inspect the cable.,
Obtain the correct cable.,
Undo the pinch bolt.,
Unscrew the adjuster.,
Remove the cable.,
Replace the outer casing.,
Hook the nipple back in.,
Tighten.,
Perform checks.,
Cut the cable.,
Do a final check.",How to Change a Bicycle Brake Cable," Change a bike cable if it is frayed or it is getting stiff. When either of these two indicators are present, there may be damage on the inner wire, or often on the outer wire. Any friction in the cable will stop your brakes from returning properly. Check for damage to the outer casing, the cranks, and for any bends in the wires. You'll need to replace both the cable and its outer casing if it is damaged.;
, It is important to ensure that you have the correct cable. Check the nipple at the end of the cable and see that it matches the cable you are replacing. Brake cables are different for straight handle-bars and drop handle-bars.

, Locate the pinch bolt that clamps the cable. Undo it with an Allen key. Don't lose the piece of rubber that slides off the cable or the metal ""noodle"" - you'll need to put these back on later.








, Find the adjuster next to the brake lever on the handlebar. It is a small barrel that can be turned. Unscrew the adjuster with your fingers.








, Align the two slots on the adjuster where the brake cable goes through on top of the brake lever. The cable will gently fall out if you ease it.








, Hold up the new outer casing against the old one so you know the correct length.









Use the wire cutters to make a clean cut. Check that there is a smooth hole at the incision for the cable to run in and out. Then attach a metal ferrule.
Slide the cable into the hole. Check that it fits well. Slide the rest of the cable into the outer casing.

, Hook the nipple into the end of the brake lever, and ease into the brake lever and into the two slots in the barrel adjuster. At the other end, thread the cable through the metal ""noodle"" and push the outer casing into it. Slide on the piece of rubber, placing on the larger end first. This stops dirt getting into your cable. Slide under the cable clamp bolt and thread through.









Clamp it temporarily with the Allen key. Reconnect the brake by pulling it across and slotting it into the hole. Make sure the metal noodle is bedded down in place.

, Loosen the Allen key bolt and pull the cable through. Hold the cable, loosen the Allen key, pull the cable tight and tighten up again.








,









Pull firmly on the brake lever multiple times to stretch out the new cable. Readjust the tension as necessary.
Check that the outer casing is properly located into the cable adjuster and into the noodle.
Check that the other end of the noodle is in the final slot.
Pull on the brake lever several times. This will make sure everything is in place. This helps to bed the cable in. If it feels loose, you'll need to tighten it a bit more. When finished, make sure you have tightened the bolt up firmly.

, Now is a good time to cut the end of the cable.


Leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of cable poking out from the brake clamp.
Attach a cable end cap to stop the end fraying. Squash it into place with either pliers or the end of the cable cutters.
Hook around by the brake.

, Make sure your brakes work properly before you go riding.

Find a firm, even space to jack up the car.,
Ensure you have room to work safely.,
Insert a wheel chock.,
Ensure the car is in park.,
Engage the parking brake.",How to Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack1," When you jack up a portion of the car, the weight of that portion will be centralized into the relatively small space beneath the jack. Because of this, it is essential that you jack your car up on a surface that can support that kind of pressure such as concrete or pavement. It is extremely unsafe to jack a car up on an angle, so it is also very important that you choose a level space.Never, under any circumstances, jack a car up on angled ground.
Jacking a car up on a surface that isn’t strong enough can cause the jack to topple over or sink.;
, People often find themselves jacking up their car while replacing a flat tire on the road. Whether you’re using an emergency jack or a trolley jack, it’s important to ensure you have enough room to work without putting yourself or others at risk. Make sure you have at least enough room to stand with an outstretched arm toward the jack without coming into contact with a wall or being in the street.You should be able to sit behind your jack without being in the lane of the road.
If you do not have sufficient space, find a different area to jack your car up.

, Wheel chocks can be purchased, but you can also use a number of things if you don’t have ready access to one. A wheel chock is usually shaped like a small ramp and is placed beneath a tire on the opposite end of the vehicle of the side you are jacking up. Always place the wheel chock on the outside end of the wheel to prevent the vehicle from rolling or shifting as you jack the other side up.One wheel chock will usually suffice, but for added safety, feel free to chock the other wheel opposite the end you’re jacking up as well.
If you don’t not want to purchase a wheel chock, you can use anything that will safely prevent the wheel from rolling, such as a large rock or block of wood.
Plastic wheel chocks can be purchased at most auto parts stores.

, If your car is equipped with an automatic transmission, it should be in park before you jack it up. Putting your car in park prevents the wheels from turning. Remember, however, your car may still shift when in park, so it’s important to utilize wheel chocks in conjunction with placing the vehicle in park.Remember that putting the car in park will lock its drive wheels in place, so a front wheel drive car’s front wheels won’t turn in park, and vice versa for a rear wheel drive vehicle.
If your car is equipped with a manual transmission, try putting the car in first gear to prevent it from rolling.

, Depending on your vehicle, the parking brake may be a handle in the center console of your car or a pedal on your left side when sitting in the driver’s seat. Pull up on the handle or press down on the pedal to engage the parking brake and prevent your vehicle from rolling while it’s being jacked up.If you are unsure where your parking brake is or how to use it, refer to your car’s owner’s manual for help.
The parking brake will lock the rear wheels in place and is of particular importance when jacking up the front of the car.

Locate the appropriate jack points for your vehicle.,
Ensure the valve on the jack is closed.,
Slide the jack beneath the jack point.,
Raise and lower the handle of the jack to lift the vehicle.,
Lift the vehicle only as high as necessary.",How to Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack2," Every vehicle has specific points on the frame that were designed to withstand the stress of jacking up the vehicle. These jack points are not always easily identified, so refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to help you find them if you are having difficulty.There are commonly jack points on the frame of your car to the inside of each wheel, and at a center point on the front and back of the car.
Jacking the car up at a point that is not designed for it can bend the frame of your car and cause significant damage.

, Trolley jacks utilize hydraulics to lift your vehicle off of the ground. When the hydraulic valve is open, the jack will not create pressure on the piston and it will fail to raise your car. Use the handle of the jack or a pair of pliars to turn the valve clockwise until it is completely closed. Re-insert the handle into the jack once done if you used the handle to close the valve. Different jacks may place the valve in different places, but it is often a different color than the rest of the jack or is left unpainted completely.
The valve is usually located on the end of the jack that faces you while in operation.

, Slide your trolley jack beneath the jack point you’ve identified so the cup of the jack is sitting just beneath it. You may need to raise the cup of the jack slightly by lifting the jack handle and pressing it back down once to make sure the jack is positioned properly.The cup on the jack should be centered on the designated jack point for the vehicle.
There are teeth or ridges on the cup of the jack to help prevent the car’s frame from sliding as it’s jacked up.

, Depending on the style and size of the trolley jack you are using, you may need to lift up the handle and press it toward the floor a number of times to jack up the car. Start slow, paying close attention to the frame around the jack point to look for signs of bending or crimping of the metal. Once you have lifted the car a few inches, you should be able to easily determine if the jack point is supporting the weight of the vehicle.It may take a good deal of force to press the handle of the jack toward the ground as it raises the car.
If you see signs that the metal is bending, lower the car and reposition the jack unto the jack point properly.

, As you raise your car higher, you increase the risk associated with it falling off of the jack, as well as the likelihood that the jack itself will fall over or fail. If you are jacking the car up to change a tire, raise it only so the tire is barely off of the ground. If you need to get under the vehicle, ensure your jack can safely raise the vehicle to the height you intend.Trolley jacks have the maximum height and weight they are rated for on the packaging, and often on the body of the jack in the form of a sticker.
Do not jack a car up until the arm of the trolley jack is standing straight up. It should always be slightly slanted.

"
"
Do not allow any part of your body beneath the vehicle on the jack.,
Place jack stands beneath the vehicle.,
Lower the car onto the jack stands slowly.,
Raise the car off of the jack stands once you’re done.",How to Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack3," A trolley jack is not designed to support the weight of the vehicle while you work under it. Instead, trolley jacks are intended to raise the vehicle’s height so you can safely place jack stands beneath it. Never place a part of your body beneath a vehicle supported only by a jack.As jacks get older, they often begin to leak.
A leaking jack will lower the vehicle back onto the ground at a rate that can be unpredictable.

, Before working on the car you jacked up, slide a jack stand beneath the car at a designated jack point. Jack stands are designed to support a great deal of weight and once in place they make it impossible for the vehicle to lower back to the ground. Lift the top of the jack stand until it’s at the height you prefer (slightly lower than the vehicle currently is) and slide it beneath a jack point.You can purchase jack stands at your local auto parts store.
If you are jacking up the entire front or back of the vehicle, use a jack stand on each side.

, With the jack stand in place, use the jack’s handle or a pair of pliars to slowly turn the valve on the jack counter clockwise. Be very careful, as the jack will lower the vehicle faster the further the valve opens. Make sure the jack stands are positioned properly before allowing the vehicle’s weight to rest on them.If the jack stand is not positioned properly, raise the car again slightly and reposition it.
Ensure all four legs of the jack stand are firmly on the ground and level before working beneath the car.
Remove the jack while working on the car to prevent it from being raised off of the jack stands by accident.

, Once you’ve finished working on your car, slide the jack back into place beneath the vehicle. Close the valve completely, then raise and lower the handle until you have jacked the car up off of the jack stand. Once the weight of the vehicle is off of the stand, remove it and lower the car back to the ground. Make sure the jack stands are clear of the car before lowering it back to the ground.

Alter your vehicle's leaf springs.,
Remove the leaf springs from the rear suspension of the vehicle.",How to Lower a Car1," Leaf springs consists of thin strips of spring steel banded and bolted together.;
, Take them to a spring shop and have them de-arched, or use a reverse shackle.


Another option is reversing the set up by placing the axle on top of the leaf spring, which is called a flip kit. This can be done by a home mechanic with common hand tools.






To get even greater or increased drop, couple the flip kit with lowering blocks. These are available online or from your local auto parts store. They come in differing heights and will enable the vehicle to drop extremely low. They can be installed by a home mechanic. Depending on how low you go, you may have to install a C-notch above your real axle. The purpose of the notch is to give you a greater clearance between your frame and axle.






"
"
Manipulate your car's coil springs.,
You can also cut the coils yourself.",How to Lower a Car2," Coil springs can be found on a car's front and/or back suspension, and are attached onto the A-frame or the axles.

You can remove the stock coil springs and replace them with shorter springs, or take your springs to a spring shop and have the coils softened and shortened.







,


Use a grinder, cutting wheel, or torch to cut them.
Start with cutting in quarter- or half-coil-turn increments, because cutting a coil is a permanent action. You may have to install shorter bump stops or cut your stock ones to fit.







"
"
Replace the springs and shocks.",How to Lower a Car3," Trade them out for adjustable airbag units available at a local auto supply store or from an online auto parts seller.


In addition to installing the airbags to replace the springs, this method of lowering your car also requires installation of air lines, an air compressor, air reservoir tank and system activation switch.
This process can be done at home.

If you have rear leaf springs, you will need to get rid of them and replace them with a 4 link setup. This process usually needs a professional fabricator.

"
"
Replacing your car's springs with hydraulic cylinders.",How to Lower a Car4," Hydraulics can be installed on 1, 2, 3 or all 4 suspension corners of your car.


Installing a hydraulic system also requires installing an internal control system, hydraulic pumps and batteries to operate the pumps.






One drawback to this method of lowering your vehicle is the large amount of battery power required to operate each hydraulic pump in the system.

Adjust your car's torsion bars down using the torsion bar key.",How to Lower a Car5,"


This will sag your vehicle so it is lower to the ground.






Torsion bars come factory equipped on vehicles and consists of a spring steel bar that's used in place of a coil or leaf spring. The torsion bar key is part of the torsion bar, which allows the vehicle ride height to be adjusted at the factory when the vehicle is built and as needed afterward.
It's easily adjusted with a small hand wrench at home.

Fill the torque converter to be used.,
Install the torque converter.,
Check the seating position.,
Finish up.",How to Install a Torque Converter in a 4l60e Transmission," Position the transmission in a spacious and level area such as an open garage floor or on a workbench.;
, The original torque converter can be removed by positioning yourself in front of the bellhousing. Hold on to the converter by its sides, primarily at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions. Gently pull it back towards you and slowly rotate in a rocking motion by moving your hands up and down a few inches as if you were turning a steering wheel.

, The torque converter will contain a few quarts of fluid. Place it with the bolt holes face-up in an appropriately sized bucket or drain pan and let it sit for about 30 minutes. The fluid will drain out very slowly.

, Now would be a good time to inspect the input shaft for any damage. If any damages are found such as broken or chipped splines, repair before installing the converter and transmission back in vehicle.

, Whether the torque converter you are using is new or used, it is always best to fill it with at least a quart of new fluid before installing. Place the torque converter face down on a flat surface so that the input splines are facing up. The fluid will go in very slowly. Pour in as much as you can without the fluid running over. Once the fluid drains down, pour in more and repeat the process until you have at least a quart in the torque converter.

, The torque converter will slide onto the input shaft three times, each time seating further into the bellhousing followed by a ""clunk.""


First, hold the torque converter horizontally and face down (bolt holes facing towards the ground) so that the fluid will not drain back out.
When ready to insert on the input shaft, turn the converter vertically with the bolt holes facing towards you. Hold the torque converter by its sides at 3 and 9 o'clock and slide onto the input shaft while slowly rotating it back and forth, as in Step 2, until you hear the first “clunk.”
Continue to gently push on the torque converter and slowly rotate it back and forth. After a few seconds of this, it will slide back further and you will hear a second “clunk.” The torque converter is not properly seated yet and this is where the mistake of improperly installing it happens.
Continue gently pushing on the torque converter while slowly rotating it until you hear a third and final “clunk.” It is now properly seated. If you continue to push and rotate, you will hear a scraping noise coming from behind the torque converter. This is normal and one way to tell it is installed properly.

, Measuring from the face of the bolt holes to the edge of the outer edge of the bellhousing, the torque converter should sit back 1 ¼ inches or about 3cm inside the bellhousing.

, With the torque converter now properly installed, you may now reinstall the transmission in the vehicle, permitted it is ready for use, or store the transmission for later use."

Most 1989 and newer cars have four 14mm nuts that hold the column to the dash.,Carefully remove the column from the vehicle and set aside.,
To install a new column, line it up inside the coupler and fasten it to the dash.,
Install the pinch bolt so it's tight.,Reconnect any cables or wires you disconnected.,Reinstall the steel backing and the knee bolster.,Reinstall any trim and the hush panels you removed to access the steering column.,Reconnect the battery.,
Make sure the steering operates correctly before taking the car out in traffic.",How to Install a Steering Column," This is so the airbag can deactivate. If you have a radio with a theftlock system, you might want to unlock it first or you will be taking it to the dealer to fix it.
,, Some are held on with 7mm screws, push fasteners., These usually pull off and are held in place with clips. Look for screws and be careful as this is plastic., These are usually held on by several bolts., Loop the seatbelt through the steering wheel instead., This is what holds the column to the steering gear. You may have to move the steering wheel to access the bolt. Sometimes this is outside, or inside the vehicle. On many front wheel drive cars with rack and pinion steering, this means dropping the engine cradle 4 inches (10.2 cm) to access it. You may have to peel back a rubber boot to access this as well. Make a note as to how far you had to turn the wheel and return it to the original position after removing the bolt. For example, if you had to turn the wheel 1/2 turn to the right, turn it back 1/2 turn to the left. Use a piece of masking tape or use some other means to keep the wheel from turning after this is disconnected. Turning the wheel too far or losing center can destroy expensive parts., Cars with shifters on the column usually have a cable that runs to the transmission and that could be inside or outside the firewall. Unhook this too., If your ride has a shifter on the column and the shift indicator is mechanical, you will need to make sure you don't break the cable as you lower the column. If you have one of these, make a mark where the clip goes and remove it before you lower the column. Many of these are parts are NLA (no longer available) from the dealer as these were only made through the late 1990s.,, The wheel on the new column needs to be pointed straight ahead. If yours had the mechanical shift indicator, install this on the new part before raising it all the way and cinching it up., Reinstall the boot over the coupler.,,,,, You are responsible for make sure your vehicle is safe to drive."

Check the structural components of the car for rust.,
Disassemble your interior.,
Lift the car.,
Move the fuel line and the fuel tank out of the way.",How to Install Subframe Connectors1," Subframe connectors work to increase the strength of your frame, but this won’t help much if there are weak points due to rust. You should repair any rust spots before installing your subframe connectors.;
, What comes out will depend heavily upon where you are making welds. You should remove any seats, carpet, stereo equipment, etc. that might get too hot and ignite due to your welding underneath it. This helps to prevent fires inside the car while you’re welding.


If you are using the bolt-on only method of installing subframe connectors, this step is not necessary at all.

, This seems simple, but it can be tricky. Your car needs to be as level as possible to minimize body flex. If your car is uneven, it twists and flexes the body. If you then weld the subframe connectors in while the body is twisted, you weld in that distortion and make it permanent. You should use ramps or a drive-on body lift.

, You do NOT want to ignite the fuel line or tank while welding. Do not shortcut this step. If you need to remove the fuel lines and tank do it.

Check drill clearance underneath your car.,
Identify which connector goes on which side.,
Place the subframe connectors as close as possible to the frame rail.,
Install the cross brace nuts.,
Drill the necessary holes.,
Install your bolts.",How to Install Subframe Connectors2," It may be necessary to move or remove parts of the exhaust in order to properly fit the drill underneath your car and install the subframe connectors.This will depend on the make and model of your vehicle.

, This is easily done, as the connectors are different for either side. Make sure that you are not mixing them up. This isn’t hard as they will typically be labeled right and left and only fit on the correct side of the vehicle., Place a piece of wood between the subframe connector and a hydraulic jack and use the jack to hold the connector in place against the frame rail., The cross brace fits over the seat bolts and is secured by a nylock nut and washer for each seat bolt.This will help hold the connector in place while you drill the holes for the bolts.

, With the subframe connector in place, put the drill bit in a bolt hole on the subframe connector and drill straight through the frame rail from the outside toward the center of the car. Next, go underneath your car and drill through the other side of the frame rail the same way, but this time you will be drilling from the center toward the outside of the car. Do this for all bolt holes on your subframe connectors.Lining up the subframe connectors first and drilling through the bolt holes makes sure that the holes are aligned such that the bolts that come with the subframe connectors go straight through the frame rail. This is what fastens your subframe connectors to the car.
Be sure that you are have the subframe connectors properly aligned and that you only drill where the bolt holes are. You do not want to drill any unnecessary holes in your vehicle.

, Now that the holes are all cut in, you can install your bolts. Thread them through one side to the other and attach them with any washers and nuts provided. Tighten to the recommended torque listed by the manufacturer.

Mark your welding locations.,
Clean all welding surfaces.,
Raise the subframe connectors into place.,
Verify there are no gaps greater than ⅛-inch.,
Secure the connectors to the car using 6-inch clamps.,
Weld the connectors in place at the front and back.",How to Install Subframe Connectors3," A white grease pencil works well for this. You will weld at the front and back of the subframe connectors. If you have end caps for your connectors, you will weld those on as well. It is also advised that you weld patches in regular intervals along the sides of your connectors., This can be done with a wire wheel attached to a drill. Strip all mounting points on the car and mounting plates on the connectors down to bare metal for welding., Just like with the bolt-on option, you will need your subframe connector to be in place along the frame rail. You can use a wooden block and a hydraulic jack to properly fit the subframe connector up against the frame rail..


If your connectors have a bolt-on option, bolt one side in to help hold the connector in place during welding.

, You need the metal of the frame rail to be close enough to the metal of the subframe connector to place sturdy welds. If you notice any gaps that you could slide the thickness of a nickel, you should measure them. If you have any ⅛-inch or larger gaps, you will need to readjust your subframe connectors to close those gaps before welding.

, You want to prevent the subframe connector from moving while you are welding it into place.The connector needs to be flush with the inner rail, but don't be concerned if the outer connector doesn't align with the body of the car., Welding the connector will take some time.


The weld needs to run around the connector mounting plates and the car’s subframe.If your connectors include end caps, secure the end caps and weld them in place as well.

"
"
Reattach any exhaust components.,
Reinstall the fuel tank and lines.,
Reinstall all interior pieces.,
Enjoy the ride.",How to Install Subframe Connectors4," If you had to remove any parts of the exhaust to make room for the drill or welder, reattach them now.

, It is likely that these were removed, especially if you were welding on your frame rails. Now that all of the welding is done, it is safe to reinstall your fuel lines and fuel tank.

, If you removed carpet or other interior items to protect them from welding, you should reinstall them.

, Subframe connectors improve the handling and quality of your ride, go out and enjoy the upgrade.

Read your vehicle's owner's manual.,
Find an appropriate speedometer.,
Gather the necessary tools.,
Disconnect your vehicle’s battery.,
Loosen the screws around your vehicle’s instrument cluster.,
Pull the instrument cluster out of the dash.,
Locate your speedometer in the instrument cluster.,
Take pictures of the current configuration.,
Disconnect the wiring from the current speedometer.,
Set the new speedometer in place on the instrument panel.,
Reconnect lighting connections for the speedometer.,
Slide the instrument cluster back into position.,
Replace the panel face plate in front of your instrument panel.,
Reconnect your car's battery.,
Check the speedometer’s calibration.",How to Install a Speedometer," Before you touch so much as a screw around the vehicle’s instrument cluster, thoroughly read the owner’s manual. You will find helpful information in the manual concerning the wiring around the dash cluster, as well as a schematic for the instrument panel that will help locating the correct hardware, wiring, components, etc.


Many cars, especially those purchased used from private owners may no longer have the owner’s manual. You might be able to find a downloadable version of the manual online from the manufacturer’s website, but if not, you should be able to order one directly from the manufacturer via a certified dealership.;
, The dimensions of a speedometer vary from vehicle to vehicle and after-market products are most certainly not universal. You can consult the parts department at a certified dealer to ensure that you order a speedometer that will fit properly into your instrument panel.


The gauge won’t just need to meet dimension specifications, but you also have to consider what all connects to your specific vehicle’s speedometer. Some have one wire for a dash light while some have two. Vehicles with an automatic transmission may also have a gear selection wire connected to the speedometer. Ordering a component with everything you need is essential.
If you would rather not go through a dealership but you have a trusted mechanic, he or she will likely have access to the same parts information and can also ensure that you order an appropriate speedometer.

, While removing and installing a speedometer doesn’t require any specialized equipment, you do need to make sure that you have both phillips and flathead screwdrivers on hand, as well as a pair of pliers, a good wrench set, and possibly a good socket wrench set.

, The wiring to your current speedometer feeds from the vehicle’s battery, and you risk shocking yourself while dealing with these wires if you do not disconnect the battery first thing.

, One of the schematic pages in your owner’s manual should point out the location of each screw you will need to remove. Pay close attention to which screws instead of removing every screw around the cluster since some of them may not need to be removed.


Make sure you store the screws in a safe spot where you will not lose them while working on the installation.
After removing the screws, the face plate around the instrument panel will still be held in place by pressure clips. Use a flathead screwdriver to pry an edge of the plate forward gently and pull lightly on the plate until all of the pressure clips release. Be very careful during this because it is possible to break the clips.There will be large electrical plugs connected to buttons such as your hazard lights as well. You can hold the release to easily remove these plugs. In most model vehicles, these plugs only fit into their proper housing, so incorrectly connecting them later is impossible.When in doubt, label each with a piece of tape as you disconnect it.

, Though all of the wiring will still be connected, you will have some room to ease the instrument cluster forward from the dash., The backside of your speedometer will be a rounded or squared box with several wires attached for powering the gauge itself as well as the dash lighting that illuminates the gauge when you turn on your headlights., When all else fails, connecting the wiring to look like the picture is better than trying to remember how the configuration looked before disconnecting the old speedometer.


Between the pictures you take and the schematic in your owner’s manual, you should feel more comfortable disconnecting the old speedometer as well.

, Depending on your vehicle’s manufacturer, disconnecting any wiring connectors may require the use of pliers, wrenches, and/or a screwdriver. Loosen any screws or connectors until the wiring comes off easily. Don’t force it. Otherwise, you may turn the relatively easy gauge swap into a much more difficult electrical problem that requires a professional.


There will likely be additional screws on the back of the instrument panel that hold the speedometer in place. You will also need to remove these screws in addition to the wiring to completely free the gauge from the panel.
In some model vehicles, this wiring may all be joined into one single plug that is snapped into place in the back of the speedometer. For this setup, simply push down on the release on the plug and remove it from the speedometer., Reattach it by screwing it to the mounting points that held the old speedometer in position.

, Reconnect the wiring as your owner's manual schematic and your reference pictures indicate. You may have to tighten down some connections as well. If the model is compatible with your car, they should connect as the old one did.


If your model vehicle has a joint-wiring plug and you ordered a suitable speedometer, then the plug should snap easily into place.

, You will have to replace any screws that you initially removed from the cluster as well.

, You will have to reconnect any electrical plugs that you disconnected when removing the plate as well as snap the pressure clips back in place before tightening the screws in place.


Don’t tighten the screws down too hard since this piece is plastic in most vehicles and can break.

, After you reconnect it, confirm that the electrics turn on. Since you likely had to unplug a few items connected to the panel plate, check everything in the dash from your hazard lights to your turn signals and headlights. Make sure everything is in working order.

, By using a stopwatch and your odometer, you can test drive your car and confirm that the new speedometer is accurate.


Pick a large empty parking lot or another area where you can maintain a slow consistent speed. If you go one mile (odometer) in three minutes (stopwatch) at a consistent speed, then you know you were traveling at 20mph.
If your new speedometer is off, follow the manufacturer’s directions that came with your specific speedometer to calibrate it.

Properly maintain your vehicle.,
Install a cold air intake.,
Improve your vehicle’s exhaust flow.,
Have your vehicle’s computer reprogrammed.,
Swap out ignition components.",How to Increase the Horsepower of Your 4 Cylinder Car1," Although it’s often overlooked as a way to pull additional horsepower from your motor, properly maintaining your vehicle is essential to producing as much power as possible. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for recommended service intervals and ensure your adhere to them.Make sure to change your oil every 3,000 miles or at your vehicle’s recommend intervals.
Replace your air and fuel filters periodically to ensure the unimpeded flow of air and fuel into the engine.;
, The four-cylinder engine in your vehicle is powered by compressing a mixture of air and fuel and igniting it. Because the level of compression your engine will produce is a constant (determined by the piston throw) you can produce more power by allowing for the flow of more air and fuel into the engine itself. To install a new intake, remove the stock intake tube and air box surrounding the air filter and replace it with an aftermarket one designed to increase the amount of air that passes into the engine.Most aftermarket cold air intakes come with a cone shaped filter that more efficiently pulls air from the atmosphere.
Increasing the amount of air flow into your engine can also improve gas mileage.
Many aftermarket intakes produce more noise than their stock counterparts.

, As your engine ignites the mixture of air and fuel, it pushes the piston downward. The exhaust produced from this explosion must be evacuated from the cylinder chamber before more air and fuel can be injected. Replacing portions of your exhaust with larger diameter pipes will reduce the backpressure limiting the speed the exhaust may exit the engine. You may choose to replace the piping from the catalytic converter back (referred to as a “cat-back” exhaust) or all of the piping leading to the exhaust manifold.Kits can be purchased to replace however much of your vehicle’s exhaust system you may choose.
Forced induction applications like turbocharged vehicles will gain even more power from installing a higher flowing exhaust than a normally aspirated engine will.

, In most modern vehicles, a computer controls a number of variables that affect how the engine runs. These computers are programmed from the factory to balance efficiency, emissions, reliability, power output and gas mileage. Reprogramming the computer to prioritize power can often free up horsepower without installing any new components.Search for companies that offer replacement computers for your specific vehicle online. You can either purchase a replacement or send yours out to be reprogrammed.
Many companies sell programmers you can plug into the OBDII port of your vehicle to change the code in the computer you have.

, For an engine to function properly, it needs air, fuel and a spark to ignite the mix. Old spark plugs and worn out spark plug wires can prevent your ignition system from adequately detonating the air/fuel mixture. Your ignition components are often rated to be good for up to 100,000 miles, but replacing them with specialized aftermarket components can result in a more complete burn of air and fuel.The more air and fuel your engine burns, the more power it produces.
Worn out spark plugs can even fail to ignite at all, resulting in a misfire.
Larger diameter or more conductive ignition wires can reduce the time it takes for the spark to reach the mixture.

Install a new throttle body.,
Swap out your pistons for a higher compression ratio.,
Install more aggressive camshafts.,
Use headers to improve exhaust flow.,
Use a boost controller in turbocharged vehicles.",How to Increase the Horsepower of Your 4 Cylinder Car2," The throttle body is the point that your intake meets the engine and the air is funneled into the intake manifold. In many applications, installing a throttle body with a larger diameter will allow even more air to flow into the engine, resulting in an increase of power. Throttle bodies are often held in place with four bolts and will require a new gasket to be placed between the throttle body and intake manifold when installed.Throttle body diameter is usually measured in millimeters. Swapping a 65 millimeter throttle body for a 75 millimeter one can dramatically increase the air that flows into the engine.
You can purchase throttle bodies with larger diameters at many auto parts stores or online performance marketplaces.
Make sure to purchase a throttle body designed for your specific year, make and model of vehicle.

, Replacing the pistons in your engine is a significant project, but the resulting horsepower increase can be equally as significant. In many vehicles, you will need to remove the entire engine to replace the pistons, but in some you can actually remove the oil pan and crank shaft, followed by the piston rods and pistons.If installing forced induction like a turbocharger or supercharger, you should choose pistons made of forged steel as opposed to the more common cast steel. Forged steel can withstand higher pressures and temperatures.
There are a number of steps involved in replacing pistons, many of which are best left to professionals.

, The camshaft or shafts in your engine have the important task of opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves that allow the air and fuel to enter the engine and the exhaust to exit it at just the right time. Stock camshafts are designed with a combination of efficiency, power, fuel economy and emissions in mind, but replacing them with more specialized ones can dramatically increase the power output of the engine.Many modern vehicles come equipped with variable cam timing (such as Honda’s V-Tech), but even these cam shafts can be replaced for more specialized applications.
Pushrod motors have a camshaft located in the engine block, whereas modular motors will have them in the cylinder heads.

, Just as replacing components of the exhaust system will increase the efficiency of the exhaust exiting the engine, aftermarket exhaust manifolds designed with larger diameter pipes and equal length piping will improve the balance and efficiency of the way exhaust exits your engine. Aftermarket exhaust manifolds are commonly referred to as headers, and can add significant power to your vehicle.In many four-cylinder vehicles, the exhaust manifold is bolted to the cylinder head at the front of the car.
Turbochargers are mounted to the exhaust manifold of turbocharged vehicles, and the increased efficiency of headers will have an even more dramatic effect on the power output of such vehicles.

, Many four cylinder sports cars now come equipped with turbochargers. These turbochargers produce more pressure than regular atmospheric air can, forcing more air into the engine than would otherwise be possible. Installing an aftermarket boost controller on the vacuum line between the turbocharger and waste gate can allow you to increase the amount of boost the turbocharger produces.Remember that your engine needs to maintain an appropriate air/fuel ratio, so never increase the boost more than your specific vehicle’s fuel system can support.
An aftermarket boost gauge can be considered mandatory for this modification to ensure you know exactly how many PSI of boost your vehicle is producing.
An air/fuel or exhaust gas temperature gauge can help you ensure you are supporting the increased air flow with enough fuel.

Turbocharge your vehicle.,
Supercharge your vehicle.,
Use a wet or dry nitrous oxide kit.,
Have your vehicle professionally tuned.",How to Increase the Horsepower of Your 4 Cylinder Car3," If your vehicle did not come equipped with a turbocharger from the factory, you can install one on a normally aspirated motor to significantly increase power output. A turbocharger uses the exhaust flowing out of the motor to power a turbine fan that forces compressed air into the engine. Turbocharging a vehicle requires a number of supporting modifications to the vehicle’s fuel system. The internal components of your engine, such as pistons and rods, may also need to be replaced to withstand the added stress.Remember that adding forced induction like a turbocharger requires an increase in fuel to support the added air.
Kits for your specific vehicle may be available that include all of the components required to turbocharge it.

, A supercharger works by forcing compressed air into the engine just like a turbocharger does, but it is powered by the serpentine or an accessory belt instead of by the exhaust. Because superchargers are belt driven, they are not as efficient as turbochargers but are favored by those who value power at lower RPMs.Superchargers require supporting fuel modifications just like turbochargers.
Supercharger kits often come with a bracket and larger serpentine belt to support the addition of the supercharger pulley.
Unlike turbochargers, there is no need to wait for the turbo to spool. Superchargers produce power at all RPMs.

, Nitrous oxide contains more oxygen than atmospheric air, so injecting nitrous into your vehicle’s engine works in much the same was as a turbocharger or supercharger. “Wet” nitrous kits inject a combination of nitrous and fuel into the cylinders and can produce more power safely than “dry” kits which inject only nitrous. Most four cylinder motors can withstand up to eighty horsepower worth of nitrous oxide being injected without suffering any adverse effects.Make sure to order a nitrous kit designed for your vehicle if you don’t have the tools or skill set to fabricate the components you need to install the kit.
Unlike other forms of forced induction, nitrous oxide only increases wear on the engine while armed.

, After installing a form of nitrous or forced induction, it’s important to have your vehicle tuned to support the increase in power. Taking your vehicle to a professional tuning shop will allow them to use a dynamometer to test various air/fuel ratios at different RPMs, ensuring the maximum power output at each point in the vehicle’s power band.The price to have your vehicle “dyno-tuned” varies from location to location.
Dyno-tuning can free up significant amounts of power from the modifications you’ve already installed.

,


Turn off your car's battery and disconnect the negative cables before installing the airbag.
Now wait for the capacitor in the airbags control module to completely discharge, about 10 to 15 minutes. The capacitor is what carries a charge that deploys the airbag system if your car is involved in a crash or accident.
The airbag fuses must also be deactivated. Refer to your car's manual to locate the fuses.
Touching the metal part of the connector of the new airbag could accidentally set it off with static electricity so carefully avoid touching it.

,


Start by checking to see if there is a collapsible steering column in your car. Check your manual to help you find it. It is usually located between the plastic covering of the column and the back of the steering wheel. You will most likely need to replace the column if it is damaged.
Check the clock spring. The clock spring is the connector that the driver's side airbag gets plugged into. You will also have to replace this if burned or damaged.

,


To replace driver's side airbag, unscrew the screws of the steering wheel column and place somewhere safe. Pull out the old airbag until the backside with wires are visible. Unplug the old airbag from the wires. Grab the new airbag and plug it into the wires. Now put the steering column back on.

",How to Get a Smog Check (USA)," In an effort to reduce carbon emissions that lead to global warming, many states are being proactive in regulating pollutants being emitted through your automobile exhaust system.;
, This site tells you which counties in each state have smog check requirements and what vehicles need to be tested.

, California's Smog Check program was created to help California have cleaner air as well as to help the state meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act.


Sites such as the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Automotive Repair can give you detailed information to help get you started.

, In California, for example, your registration renewal notification will state ""Smog Certification Required.""

,


If you are doing your smog check to renew your registration, then take your vehicle, your registration renewal paperwork and your payment.
If you are transferring a vehicle to a state that has a smog check requirement or your vehicle is being registered for the first time in a state with smog check requirements, you will need to not only bring your vehicle and your payment, but all necessary registration information as well.

Sit down beside the motor.,
Choke the engine.,
Set the motor to neutral.,
Pull the handle.",How to Start an Outboard Motor1," If your motor has a kill switch, you should sit close enough to plug in the kill switch. You will also need to sit close enough to the motor to reach the pull string without standing. You should remain seated while starting the motor to reduce your risk of falling overboard. A kill switch is a small part that is inserted into the motor to enable it to start and run. The kill switch will have cable that attaches to your wrist. If the cable is pulled, it removes the kill switch and shuts off the motor. This protects you from being injured by the propeller if you fall overboard.;
, Use the choke valve to restrict the amount of air coming into the engine. By turning the valve handle to the “choke” setting, you reduce the amount of air in the fuel. This means that the air-fuel mixture will contain more fuel than normal. The higher fuel concentration will help the engine start.If the engine is warm (i.e. has been running recently), you may not need to choke it at all.

, Set the gearshift on the motor to neutral. The motor will not start unless it is in neutral. This prevents the boat from accelerating as soon as the engine starts.You should also have the propeller lowed into the water before starting the motor. This improves the flow of fuel to the engine and protects anyone on board should the propeller start turning unexpectedly.

, Reach up and grasp the handle on the pull rope. Gently draw the handle back until all slack in the rope is gone. When the rope is tight, pull the handle back quickly. If the motor does not start the first time, repeat the process.If after several pulls the motor does not start, check the gas and choke. Let the motor rest two minutes before trying again.

Pull the throttle back, allowing just enough RPMs to keep the motor from dying until it warms up.","How to Start a Carbureted, Electric Start Outboard Motor"," Make sure there is fuel in the tank and the fuel tank vent is open and clear.;
,, On some controls, this is a lever beside the throttle/shift control that is lifted up far as it will go. On others, pushing a button located in the hub of the throttle lever allows you to advance the throttle without engaging forward gear.

, All outboards built before 1980 have choke plates; most of those built after 1982 have the enrichment system. The enricher opens a valve that drains fuel into the manifold to provide a rich mixture for cold starting; choke plates accomplish the same result by blocking the flow of air into the front of the carb venturi.


If you have choke plates: push the key in while turning it over to the start position. Release the key when the motor starts. You may have a separate ""choke"" button instead of a ""push-to-choke"" key switch.
If you have the enrichener: turn the key to the ""run"" position, push and hold it in for 5 or 8 seconds, then continue to hold it in while turning it to the ""start"" position. Release the key when the motor starts.

Start your motor with the handle in the NEUTRAL (up) position.,
Place your hand on top of the handle.,
For practicing purposes only advance the handle to the initial DETENT position.

,
To SHIFT INTO FORWARD, lift the Locking Mechanism with your fingers and then you push the handle forward with a firm positive motion until you ""feel"" the FORWARD DETENT.,
Practice shifting into and out of forward gear making sure to lift the locking mechanism and to use a firm action.

,
Practice shifting from neutral into reverse by pulling the handle back into the reverse detent position.

,
If you are at sea and clear of all vessels, shift into forward detent and let the boat ""idle"" forward for a little while.,
Slowly push the handle forward and accelerate the vessel while steering and using all precaution.

,
As you accelerate and push the handle forward the bow bow of most boats will rise up and you will make a large wake.",How to Shift Your Boat,"


Get familiar with the handle and its Locking Mechanism.
Check out the Neutral Detent Button and trim buttons (if so equipped).;
, Safety is a major concern. Once you shift, the propeller will start to spin. A spinning propeller can injure or kill a person or pet.

,,,, Is all clear?

,, The handle has three shift positions or ""DETENTS"". FORWARD--NEUTRAL--REVERSE. Usually the handle is straight UP for NEUTRAL.

, Note: Most remote controls are equipped with an In-Gear-Starter-Protection-Switch. This switch should prevent the motor from starting if the shifter is in gear. If the motor won't crank make sure your shifter handle is in neutral.

, Under the handle your fingers should feel the Shift Locking Mechanism. This Locking Mechanism must be lifted with your fingers before attempting to shift. Note: If you shift past the forward detent the engine will accelerate and the boat will move forward faster. This is called ""throttling"" and it should never be done while tied up to a dock. Only throttle up if you are untied and ready to proceed forward.

,, Do not shift too slow or the gears will grind.

,,, Take a good look all around your vessel to make sure that it is safe to accelerate and throttle up.

,, Eventually, as the boat speeds up the bow will drop down and the boat will ""plane-off"" and ride fast on top of the water. To slow down, slowly pull back on the handle little by little until the boat drops off-plane and returns to in-gear idle. Do not shift into neutral until the boat has slowed way down to the idle speed. Remember to ONLY SHIFT at dead idle speed.

Tilt the engine down.,
Insert the key.,
Put the motor in neutral.,
Turn the key.",How to Start an Outboard Motor2," Electric start engines should be tilted down so that the propeller is in the water. This will allow the fuel to readily flow into the engine during starting. Keeping the engine tilted down also keeps the propeller safely in the water while starting.On rare occasions, boats are equipped with fully electric outboard motors. These motors still have electric starters, and the starting procedure is the same as the procedure for a fuel driven motor with an electric start.

, Electric engines require the key to be in the ignition before important features, such as the gearshift, will operate. Insert the key into the ignition slot, and if necessary insert the kill switch, too. This should enable you to shift the engine to neutral, An electric motor may have a manual gearshift that you can move to neutral. Alternatively, you may have to move the throttle to the neutral position. This will allow you to start the engine., You start most engines by turning the key to the “On” position. Some engines will have a start button that you must push. Once the engine starts, release the key or button."
"
Aim the boat.,
Shift the engine to neutral.,
Shut down the engine.",How to Start an Outboard Motor3," Once you cut power to the engine, you will lose your ability to steer the boat. Point the boat in the direction that you would like to go. Make sure that there are no people or structures (e.g. docks) in your path., When you put the engine back into neutral, the propeller will stop turning. This stops the thrust that pushes your boat forward. Keep in mind that the engine is still running even when it is in neutral., Turn the key to the off position to stop the engine. If your engine does not have a key, close the throttle. Once your engine is off, you can remove the kill switch cable from your wrist."
"
Flush out the engine at home after every outing.,
While flushing the motor, check the water pump to make sure it has good water flow.,
After flushing the engine, disconnect the fuel line (if applicable).,
Be sure to turn off the key and, if you have a battery switch, turn it off.,
Take the engine cowling off and check for fuel or water leaks.,
Wipe down and spray all accessible mechanical components and moving parts with an anti-corrosive.,
Place the cowling back onto its fittings.,
Replace spark plugs and plug wires as needed.,
Check regularly for water in the fuel.,
Check the fuel line fittings.,
Replace the water pump impeller every two years (annually if it is used in saltwater).,
Make sure that you only use fresh fuel.",How to Maintain an Outboard Motor," This doesn't just apply to saltwater adventures, but to fresh water outings as well.


If you have an older motor or one based upon an older design, you should buy a set of flushing ""earmuffs"": two flexible rubber seals attached to a metal clamp. One side can be attached to a garden hose, while the other is solid and will serve to plug a water intake. Slip the apparatus onto the lower unit where the water is taken in and then attach the earmuff to a garden hose. If there are additional water intakes that are not covered by the earmuffs, use duct tape to cover them.Attach a garden hose to the earmuffs or mount and turn the water on. Newer motor designs already have mounts, and so the earmuffs are unnecessary.
Start up the engine. The water pump will then flush out the system. (Practice safe boating and remember to stay clear of the prop and keep the motor out of gear.);
, Carefully put your finger through the stream of water exiting the motor. It should be warm, but not hot. If the output is not strong, you may have some debris stuck in the outflow tube. Immediately shut down the engine to prevent overheating and damage.


If the flow tube is obstructed, insert a small piece of wire into the tube and work it back and forth (again, while the engine remains off). Start the engine again and check the output. If that doesn't solve the problem, you may need a new water pump impeller.

, Disconnect the fuel line if the boat is going to be stored for an extended period of time. You should allow the engine to burn the small amount of fuel that is in the carburetor. Old fuel can gum up an engine, and the best way to keep the motor running at a high level is to burn off all fuel remaining in the mechanism.Be advised that if you own a two-stroke motor with more than one carburetor, the top carburetor will run dry first while all of the cylinders will continue to run. Without fuel, the top cylinder will not be getting any lubrication. Listen closely as the engine may get louder as the top cylinder begins to overheat. Also beware of any burning smell that is unusual for your engine.

, Just to make sure that all the moving parts are going to stay put for the next few minutes of cleaning., There should be no water or other liquids moving freely about the engine compartment. If you find leaks, consult a boating mechanic., Some of the best options are lubricants such as WD-40 or Quick-lube. Be sure to lubricate or grease all the moving parts such as the pivots, shift mechanism, throttle cables, carburetor valves, etc.

, Clean it off, and then cover the whole motor in a canvas or plastic covering for the duration of storage.

, There is no set rule regarding the appropriate life cycle of your spark plugs. If you are boating regularly or not maintaining your engine well, they will wear out faster.If your engine does not rev up adequately or had begun burning unusually high quantities of fuel, you may have a spark problem. You can check your spark plugs by unscrewing them (using a wrench) from the engine and mounting them on a spark tester.To change them, first unplug the plug wires (in most cases they will pop off). Then remove the plugs using the appropriate size of wrench. The new plugs can simply screwed into place and the plug wires snapped on over their ends.Many people like to replace the plugs and plug wires together. Plug wires are not especially long-lived. It is better to replace them at the same time as the plugs than have them burn out while you are on the water.
Make sure to memorize which plug wire is associated with each plug. They must be re-attached in precisely the same arrangement.

, Water in an engine can dramatically decrease engine performance and damage certain components (such as spark plugs).Ethanol is a common alcohol fuel additive, but it has a tendency to act as a solvent and break down seals, gaskets, and hoses--all of which can contribute to water intake. Try to avoid using fuel with ethanol if possible., Make sure they are properly seated and don't leak. Obviously, fuel leaks in a tight, hot engine compartment are incredibly dangerous. You must pay close attention to fuel lines, which can corrode over time.

, The impeller is a component of the pump, and it circulates water and prevents the engine from overheating. However, these tend to become jammed with muck over time, and should be replaced regularly. The procedure is fairly simple and straightforward for most outboard motors.Unscrew the cover plate of the impeller housing. After loosening the screws, pull the cover plate off.
Remove the old impeller. Use a pair of pliers to grip the impeller by the blade and pull it off of its shaft. Clear any debris from the housing.
Slide a new impeller onto the shaft and screw the cover plate back into place.

, Boat motors are especially sensitive to grime and the impurities in fuels. As fuels age, they begin to break into their component parts and become unusable. At the conclusion of a boating season, it is imperative that you empty your fuel tanks and lines.Dispose of the fuel and oils responsibly. Take them to the nearest recycling depot for proper disposal.

Open the mounting bracket clamps.,
Slip the motor over the transom.,
Tighten the clamps.",How to Mount a Trolling Motor1," Transom-mounted trolling motors have 1 or 2 clamps built into the mounting bracket to hold the motor in place. Turning the clamps counterclockwise (to the left) will open them.;
, The trolling motor should be placed as close to the center of the stern as possible without interfering with the operation of the main motor, if there is one. The top of the mounting bracket should be flush with the top of the stern.

, Turn the clamps clockwise (to the right) as far as they will go, so that the motor won't vibrate loose while in operation.


Transom-mounted trolling motors should be positioned so that the center of the motor section is at least 9 inches (22.5 cm) under water while the motor is running to keep the propeller from breaking the water's surface. This produces noise that can spook fish.

",How to Remove Your Mercruiser Alpha One Sterndrive," Give some thought as to what you're going to do once you have the drive removed. Rather than lay it down, a good suggestion is to prepare a place for it, especially if it is to remain off the boat for the layup season. Two 2 by 4,s by about 30 inches (76.2 cm) long etc. extending about 15 inches (38.1 cm) and clamped or otherwise secured to a good heavy table works really well. The drive can be placed with the horizontal fin that is above the prop sitting on the 2 by 4's. This places the drive in a normal upright position, good for servicing or whatever.;

Insert the mounting bolts and tighten them.",How to Mount a Trolling Motor2," The anti-cavitation is a horizontal plate above the propeller on either an outboard motor or the outboard unit of an inboard-outboard motor that keeps the propeller from breaking the water's surface as it pushes the boat forward. The mounting bracket is designed so that when the boat is ""on plane"" (the bow lifts out of the water as the boat skims across its surface), the trolling motor does break the water's surface.


Your anti-cavitation plate must run at a depth of at least 13 inches (32.5 cm) below the waterline, so that the trolling motor will run at least 6 inches (15 cm) below the waterline while in operation.

, Use the mount itself as a template for this.

, Use a drill bit sharp enough and tough enough to drill through the metal of the anti-cavitation plate.

,, This will secure the trolling motor.

These types of decks are most commonly found on bass boats, which are designed for fishing for largemouth bass in shallow water around weeds and stumps where precise boat control is necessary.

, You should place the mount base somewhere where it can accommodate the motor both when it is pulling the boat and when it is stowed on deck while the boat's main motor pushes it through the water. The base should also be placed where it provides enough clearance for the motor to break away from the base if the motor uses a breakaway mount and where the mounting screws can penetrate the deck but not the hull.

, Use the mount base as a template for this.

, Use a sharp bit to drill to a depth of 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) and clear out any debris after drilling. If the boat is made of fiberglass, you'll have to countersink the holes.

,, You'll want to hold the washers in position with your fingers as you move the mount base over the holes you drilled in the deck. If this is too difficult, place the washers over the drilled holes.

,, If it doesn't, you'll need to add more rubber washers under those bolts where the base wobbles to level it.


The base needs to rest evenly so that the motor can be raised onto the deck and locked down for transport without binding.

, Tighten the nuts to secure the base.

Determine what model drive you have.,
Read your owners manual.

,
Buy the correct amount and type of lube plus a little more.

,
Buy a little hand pump that fits the bottle of lube to fill the drive.

If your drive has an internal drive lube monitor bottle in the boat, remove the bottle from its bracket and pour out the old lube.,
If the old lube looks and smells bad it could be an indication of a problem.

,
Inspect the gear lube for evidence of metal particles or water intrusion.

,
If the lube looks bad and you suspect a problem, FIX the problem before placing the drive back into service.

,
If the lube was simply old and smelly it is a good idea to flush the drive one time with new clean lube.

,,,,, Do NOT reuse the flushing lube.

, Never reuse an old drain plug gasket. Old gaskets get brittle and hard as rock. Look closely in the hole and use the pick to make sure all of the old gaskets have been removed. Buy new drain plug gaskets and place them over the cleaned-up plugs.

,,, If you don't, the upper unit will not be lubricated properly.

,,, Be aware that the drive might have an air bubble and that the system might ""burp"" after being run. This could result in a drop of the oil level in the bottle. Just top off the bottle with clean lube and keep an eye on it. Be sure to loosen the bottle cap to avoid creating pressure in the system.

Follow the manufacturer's instruction when you install your motor.,
Use a safety cable in case the motor hits a submerged object and is knocked from the transom.",How to Buy and Install an Outboard Motor," In the U.S.A., the Coast Guard has regulations governing the size of motor as well as the number of passengers on commercially manufactured boats. Never exceed these guidelines. If you do not have a Coast Guard specification plate on your boat, ask the dealer to advise you. Just basing the size engine on the size of boat is complicated, for example, a 12 foot (3.7 m) john boat or light aluminum boat will only carry a 15 to 25 horsepower motor, but a heavy fiberglass boat the same length might go as high as 60 horsepower or more.;
, The smallest motor that will do the job is most economical, both in initial cost and fuel usage.

, There are a lot of brands to chose from, and knowing the availability of parts and the durability of the motors will help you chose yours.

, Some have hydraulic tilt, cable steering, and electric start, all of which simplify using the motor, while others have a pull rope start and a tiller handle for steering and throttle control. Because of these factors, no one piece of advice or article can cover all the possibilities. If you already have the boat, however, you need the compatible motor to your setup. In other words, if you have a steering wheel, or stick type steering system, you will want to buy a motor with a steering cable attachment, and if you have a battery and wiring to an ignition system you will want electric start. On the other hand, if you do not have these features in your boat, it is not practical to buy a motor that uses them.

, Most outboards have two cycle water cooled power-heads, or engines. This means mixing oil either in the fuel tank, or adding it to a reservoir for an oil injection system. There are air cooled 4 cycle motors on the market, in smaller sizes, and these are usually less expensive than the two cycle counterparts.

, When the motor is attached to the transom, the propeller must be below the bottom of the boat to draw water and operate correctly. Too long of a shaft will drag on the bottom in shallow water, limiting the locations it can be used and eventually ruining your prop, motor foot, and even your motor. The top of the propeller blade should be slightly lower than the keel of the boat when it is in the vertical position.

, Normally, the motor has two clamp bolts that fit over the top of the transom and tighten against it like a ""C"" clamp. These usually have short pivoting handles to turn the bolts, so that they can be tightened by hand, without over tightening them. They may also have holes in the so a lock can be place through each one, and secured to prevent someone from stealing your motor.

, This has happened many times, and the cable will keep the motor from sinking in this unfortunate event.

Add more oil if needed.,
Clean up your mess and go boating!

",How to Change Your Mercruiser Engine Oil,";
,,,,,, Cover your floor and cushions with old towels or blankets.

, This will warm up the oil and make it much easier to suck it up and out of your dipstick tube.

, After the engine has run long enough to reach operating temperature turn the motor off and let it cool for a few minutes.

, If you are using an electric oil changer bucket hook up the hose to the tube and attach the pumps wires to the battery (red is positive and black is negative).

, Mer cruiser dipstick tubes are also Oil Withdraw tubes. You can suck all the oil out of the engine through the dipstick tube. This requires the use of either a small hand pump (part 802899A1 Oil Pump which can be purchased online or you can buy a more expensive Oil Changer Pump/Bucket Assembly from a marine supply store (about $160.00 and up).

,, Turn it counterclockwise as viewed from the bottom end of the filter. In some cases the filter might be difficult to remove. This is usually because it had been over-tightened when installed. A good wrench and patience usually prevails but in some cases you have to drive a large screwdriver through the body of the filter to get it off.

, Make sure that the old filter o ring has been removed from the engine.

,,,, Over tightening the filter makes it very difficult to be removed.

, Most inline 4 cylinder engines take 4-5 quarts. Most V6 engines take about 5 quarts. Most V8 small blocks take about 5 quarts and Big Block V8's can take up to seven quarts depending on the exact model.

, Newer Mer cruiser engines use a Color Coding System to locate and identify the oil fill cap and dipstick. Mer cruiser uses yellow to identify oil service points.

, This will allow the new oil to drip all the way down into the oil pan.

,, Make sure the filter has been installed and that you have cleared the engine area of all rags and tools.

,, Look for any oil leaks. Go to the helm and observe your oil pressure gauge for a proper reading.

,,,,, In general one quart adds about 3/8"" on the dipstick. This can vary from model to model, though.

Avoid coming alongside another boat.,
If possible, attach the tow line to the bow eye.,
Use bowlines to create loops.,
Use plenty of line.,
Watch your prop(s).,
Stay in constant communication.,
Leave the drive down on the towed boat.,
Keep a knife readily available.,
Wear your PFD (Personal Flotation Device).",How to Tow a Boat," Except in the calmest of conditions, coming alongside another boat is a recipe for trouble. Wave action can slam the boats together, and, worse yet, crew members’ extremities can get caught between them. Instead, throw the tow line to the other boat from a distance.;
, The bow eye — where the winch strap on the trailer attaches — is generally the best place to attach the tow line to the towed boat. On some boats, though, it can be difficult to reach from inside the boat.

, If you need to tie the tow line around something like a bow eye, use a bowline to make the loop. Bowlines don’t slip and don’t tighten up under pressure as much as most other knots and can be untied after the tow without too much trouble.

, You should use an absolute minimum of 50 feet (15.2 m) of tow line; 100 feet (30.5 m) is much better. Remember that the boat in tow has no means of slowing down, so a longer line is an important safety measure. It also acts as a shock absorber.

, If you’re doing the towing, don’t just throw your tow line overboard before getting under way; it’s all too easy to wrap it around your prop(s). Rather, keep it on deck and have a crew member pay it out slowly as you get moving

, You should be able to instantly communicate with the crew of the other boat, and vice versa. If you can’t use radios or phones, work out a simple set of hand signals for slowing down, speeding up, stopping and cutting loose.

, Outboards or outdrives of boats in tow should be left down to provide directional stability. It’s important that they’re not turned to one side or the other. If the towed boat still swerves from side to side, try shifting weight toward its stern.

, If you’re doing the towing, you should always be ready to cut loose the towed boat in case it begins to sink, or for other reasons.

, Towing, even in the best conditions, is potentially dangerous. Everybody on both boats should be wearing a PFD throughout the operation.

Consider Trailering:


You won't find a less-expensive way to keep a boat than storing it on a trailer in your driveway or backyard.,
See if Rack Storage is Available:


Another alternative for smaller boats is rack storage, or dry stacks.,
Contact The Boat Marina:


For owners of larger boats, and owners of small boats who crave convenience, a boat marina slip is the best way to go.,
Buy Your Slip:


In some locales, it's possible to actually buy a slip in a boat marina.",How to Store Your Boat," A boat trailer has the added advantages of allowing you to boat on different bodies of water, to seize the random nice days in winter to fish or cruise and can save fees for winter boat storage.
Be sure to check your vehicle owner's manual for safety rules, tips and complete instructions on boat towing capacity . This will help make sure you're selecting the appropriate boating equipment for the model you're buying.;
, A typical rack storage facility keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles.
Make a call to the facility a designated time before you want to go boating and they will use a forklift or other lifting machine to retrieve and launch your boat. When you come back, you tie it up, walk away and they return it to the shed.

, You drive your family and gear to the marina, load the boat, cast off the lines and go. Rates vary from state to state and marina to marina, but typically you'll be charged according to the length of your boat or the length of the slip.
Boat marinas often have showers and bathrooms and offer winter storage and service options. The best marinas offer connections for electricity, wash down water, telephone, Internet and TV at the dock.
Boat marinas can be great fun as well, with slip-holders often getting together for parties, cookouts or just friendly socializing.

, The slip becomes a long-term asset.
This takes the annual guesswork out of the where-will-I-keep-my-boat equation in high-demand areas.

Research and Compare Financing Options: You can finance a new boat just like a new car.,
Decide which Options and Accessories You Would like to Have: Similar to new cars, new boats are offered with different accessories and options.,
Determine Operating Costs: Boating isn't an activity like driving where you are using gas all the time.,
Figure out how much Maintenance and Upkeep Your Boat will Require: Boat, trailer, and motor maintenance can be as simple as a freshwater wash down after each use and keeping them covered between adventures.,
Decide How and Where you will Store Your Boat: When it comes to storing your boat, you have several options depending on the size of your boat.,
Compare and Purchase Insurance: Boat insurance varies by boat length and type, by the cost of the boat and the level of coverage you want.",How to Determine the Costs of Boat Ownership," As with car and home loans, boat loans have carried extremely appealing interest rates in recent years. Terms generally range from two to 20 years. Comparing rates on-line is a great starting point.;
, When you're pricing boats, factor in the cost of electronics, accessories and water toys and buy what's appropriate for your boat type and size and your home waters. Modern marine electronics are extremely reliable, are loaded with features unheard of just a decade ago and are more affordable than ever. Don't skimp on safety gear. Today's marine accessories can increase boating safety and fun, and make it downright easier than it was just a few years ago.

, In fact, when a person is boating, they may be fishing or swimming and not using the motor at all. If you own a sailboat the motor is used even less. Most of the boats in use on the water today are less than 21' in length. These crafts do not require exorbitant amounts of gas, so any impact would be negligible. In fact, 64 percent of boaters say they purchase less than fifty gallons of gas per season, roughly two trips to the gas station, to fill up your SUV or Minivan.

, This simple task will go a long way toward keeping your maintenance costs at bay. If you don't feel like you have the time and energy to do it yourself, hire a pro. It'll pay off in the long run. Costs for routine maintenance vary by region, but for more involved services, such as oil changes and winterizing, expect to pay what you would for your car on an hourly basis. Pre-owned boats can require significantly more maintenance.

, You won't find a less-expensive way to keep a boat than storing it on a trailer in your driveway or backyard. Another alternative for smaller boats is rack storage. A typical rack storage facility keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles. For owners of larger boats, and owners of small boats who crave convenience, a marina slip is the best way to go. Learn more about different types of storage.

, Consult your insurance agent for quotes or compare rates online. Some smaller boats can be insured for a nominal sum as a rider on a homeowner's policy. You can reduce the cost of marine insurance premiums by taking a boater's education course.

Understand why you need to purchase insurance for your vessel.,
Speak to the representatives from the shop that you are purchasing your boat from.,
Review what type of watercraft you are purchasing before contacting people for information.,
Ask state organizations about the need for boat insurance.,
Think about replacement cost for the vessel if it is to become damaged and/or sink, and make sure to have all supporting cost documentation available before speaking to your insurance representative.

,
Call the insurance agent that handles your home and automobile policies.,
Speak to your insurance agent about what boat coverage they offer.,
Consider your risks and liabilities.,
Get a referral for a company that handles boat insurance if your company does not offer it.

",How to Know When Boat Insurance Is Needed,"


Purchase boat insurance to protect yourself from costs of unexpected damages beyond your reasonable control.
Realize that boat insurance in not in place to help with the cost of maintenance repairs.
Purchasing boat insurance helps protect you from the expense of unforeseen losses to your vessel, and often depending on your coverage, liability while you are on the water.;
, Their trained sales associates should be able to answer most questions that you might have in regards to insurance.

, Boats are typically water crafts under 26 feet (7.9 m), yachts are 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length, and personal watercraft include your small vessels and jet skis, as well as wave runners.

,


This can include checking out information on your state's government website. The Massachusetts government website, for example, states that boat insurance is not required by the state, but it is encouraged. They also offer additional information on boat insurance basics.
You might also inquire at the license bureau when you go to purchase the license for your boat.

,, There might be limited coverage available under your homeowner's policy, but that only typically covers around $1,000 in damages if the boat is at your home and generally offers limited liability coverage.

, If you hold multiple policies with an agency, they may offer you discounts based on multiple coverage.

, Issues that can happen to your boat can include, but are not limited to, natural disasters such as a hurricane, fire, burglary, or liability lawsuits filed by other people claiming that you were negligent. Make sure that your insurance agent is handling all of these concerns.

Make a plan.,
Prepare a work site, gather tools and supplies, carve out a dedicated time on a regular basis with your schedule, consult experts in the field, and also outsource certain components as needed to certain experts.,
Break the task down into manageable tasks.For example, if you plan to replace the floor, after preparation, salvage and use the old wood as templates for the new floor, taking new measurements (in case the old wood experienced shrinkage or damage of the years), obtaining sheets of marine-grade plywood, gathering a circular saw and jigsaw for precision cuts as well as saw horses.

,
Wrap the new floor with layers of fiberglass to add both strength and durability against rot and corrosion.,
Work your plan through to completion, making revisions as you go.",How to Restore a Boat," Plan your work by breaking everything down into sections, like chapters in a book. Chapter one is planning. The next phase might be stripping the boat in preparation for the work.;
, Also prepare the boat itself, which may mean (depending on the size and scope of the project) taking off the boat hardware, removing the seats, floor, instrumentation, windshield and sometimes even the engine. A full-blown restoration may even involve removing the stringers and re-encapsulating these with new layers of fiberglass.

,, Covering anything with fiberglass is an entirely different process that requires different tools and supplies.

, The order of steps may change, other tasks may be added, others changed. It can be a long process.

Clean the boat thoroughly.,
Remove hardware from the boat.,
Use a solvent to remove the waxy coating from the boat.,
Make any necessary repairs to the boat surface.,
Sand the boat thoroughly.",How to Paint a Boat1," You need to get everything off of the surface, from dirt and sand to marine life and seaweed. In general, it is easiest to clean the surface of the boat as it comes out of the water. Use a high-pressure hose, a scrapper, and rags to make the boat spotless.;
, You want to take off as much as possible, down to any aluminum window siding. This could cause a crease between the hardware and the paint, which will allow water to get into the cracks and ruin the paint.Anything you cannot remove you should cover in painter's tape to keep clean and protected.

, If you can feel the greasy, waxy finish on your boat you will need to remove it before painting. Using rough sponges and boat solvents, like Awl-Prep, scrub away the waxy finish.


Generally, running your finger along the surface, top or bottom, will tell you if there is still a coating-- it feels like a candle or a freshly waxed car.
If you are in any doubt about the coating, go over the boat again -- paint will not stick to this waxy surface, so it all needs to go., Fill in any nicks, cracks, or corrosion before you start painting to prevent holes or imperfections in the final paint job.


Make sure you fill in any holes with marine-grade epoxy, found near the marine paint in hardware and boat stores.

, Using 80-grit sandpaper and a random-orbit or finishing sander, sand the entire surface of the boat. This gives the paint a surface to ""grip"" to and promotes an even coat of paint. When in doubt, sand away all of the old paint. There are several important considerations to take when sanding:


If the old coat of paint is flaky or damaged you will need to strip it and sand it away entirely.
If the old paint is a different type than the one you plan to apply (non-vinyl vs vinyl paint), then remove it entirely.
Never use a belt sander on your boat

Warning: wear a respirator and eye protection when sanding, as paint chips are toxic."

Turn the boat seat upside down.,
If you buy a seat package with a new pedestal, mount the pedestal to the bolt.,
Set the seat (which was mounted to the mounting plate) onto the seat mount of the new or existing pedestal.,Double check and hand tighten any/all bolts and nuts.",How to Install a Boat Captain's Seat,"  Use the adjustable wrench (or socket set) to bolt the seat to the mounting plate.  The bolts should be provided with the mounting plate. You will want to tighten this fairly tight (hand tightened).
,  Most new pedestals will have between a 4 and 6 bolt pattern.  Place the pedestal so the holes match your existing holes, or, place the pedestal where you want it, and take a marker to trace inside the holes.  Once you have your new holes traced you will need to drill through them with a drill bit that is the same size as the pedestal bolts.  Securely fasten the pedestal bolts through the floorboard and make sure it is tight.,  Keep the seat facing the front of the boat (the direction you will be sitting once it is completed).  You will now need to screw the mounting bolts through the mounting holes of the pedestal and the universal mounting plate.  Then thread the nuts onto the bolts and hand tighten.,"
"
Paint on a dry, cool day for the best results.,
Choose the right paint for your boat.,
Apply 1-2 full coats of primer.,
Paint the boat using a roller and brush.,
Lightly sand the paint after it has dried.,
Apply 2-3 more coats of paint.",How to Paint a Boat2," You do not want excessive heat, humidity, or wind to ruin your paint job. When possible, paint your boat on a day that's roughly 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit with roughly 60% humidity.When available, paint your boat in a covered area.

, There are a lot of different paints on the market for boats -- from gel coats and simple enamels to complex two-step paint mixes. If you are painting your own boat, the best ""bang for your buck"" is definitely one-step polyurethane paint.


Two step polyurethane paint, while longer lasting, takes precise mixing and application techniques to use.
Most gel coats, excepting expensive, high-end options, will fade in 1-2 years.

, Make sure that your primer is compatible with your paint by reading the labels on both cans. Primer helps paint bond with your boat and prevents cracking and bubbling.


After the first coat has dried, lightly sand the boat (300-grit sandpaper) and apply another coat.

, You want to work quickly, using the roller to paint from the bottom of the boat up. Perform the bulk of the work with a paint roller and use the brush to get smaller areas afterwards.

, This may take anywhere from an hour to a day. Using 300-grit sandpaper, lightly sand the paint. This removes any spots, issues, or bubbling paint.

, Sand the boat lightly after every coat has dried. While this takes time, applying 2-3 clean layers of paint ensures your boat won't fade or crack for years to come.

Create the sleeve for the mast.",How to Make a Sail," Whether you want to add an emblem or are designing for efficiencies, sketch out what you want the final sail to look like so that you have a jumping off point. Look to other similar boats for inspiration.Research the dimensions of similar sails and have an idea of what kind of sailing you’d like to do. This gives basic reference points to research and execute.;
, Depending on the size of the vessel, making your sail can be a huge undertaking. Ensure that you have a workspace that can not only house a large piece of material but can also give you room to maneuver while making a lot of noise., Whether you’re a hobbyist or professional, you will need an industrial sewing machine that is able to do a zigzag stitch using V69 thread. It may be wise to let a professional take care of the sewing to ensure safety and maximum durability.If you are planning to sew the sail yourself, you will also need a special sewing table to be able to support the industrial sewing machine. This table needs to be about twice the size of a table tennis table in order to support the size of the sail., Measure the boat you intend to use the sale for in order to calculate the appropriate size of your sail. If you have a short boom and a tall mast then that is a High aspect. If you have a long boom and a short mast, it is a low aspect.Shorter booms give you more maneuverability.

, The front of the sail is called the luff curve. The luff curve is the most important part of the sail because the rest of the sail’s integrity depends on it. The luff curve at front of the sail relates to how your mast will bend.The luff curve won’t match the curve of the mast. The top third of the luff curve will be slight and the bottom of the curve, close to the boom, will be greater than the mast curve. There are different theories on what the perfect luff curve should be so research how to optimize the luff curve for your prefered type of sailing., Battens keep the shape of a sail and come in full or half where full battens are for high performance.Battens are attached to the sail using two types of pockets: pockets that you can't adjust and pockets that you can. Adjustable pockets allow you to adjust your sail more to wind conditions.


If you want more stability, add more battens; however, use less battens to make your boat easier to manoeuvre and more lightweight., Seams on your sail allow you to be strategic with choosing material that will optimize your sail’s performance. They also allow you to shape your sail more easily. A panel means that you have stitched different materials on a sail.Use heavier materials near the bottom of the sail. Seams also help to optimize the amount of material you use.

, Create your sail pattern as you would a dress. Translate your sail into real-dimensions using newspaper, cheap fabric, or another thin piece of paper. Double check all your measurements and cut out your panels when ready. The pattern should be pliable and easily moved in order to cut it out of your sail fabric.Tape fabric or newspaper together for more surface area when creating a large sail.
The luff curve and shaping the seam will create a three dimensional sail so don’t worry if your sail lies flat as you construct your pattern.

, Research what fabric works best for your sailing needs and budget. Monofilm is an economical choice but ensure you use robust material when constructing the luff and foot of your sail.Pentex taffeta scrim laminate is very durable but on the higher price end. There are also special polyesters and laminated woven fibers.Ensure that the material you choose resist stretching and can withstand rips.
Heavy monofilm and woven sailcloth are common choices.

, Place your pattern onto your chosen material and outline the edges of the panel. Before cutting any material, understand that the edges of each panel will need to be stuck together and then sewn., Once you have outlined your pattern onto your material, including battens and seams, you may now cut out your pattern. When creating a seam with shape, you want the shape to be about 35% from the luff., Move from panel to panel while leaving extra cloth at the external edges of the sail. It’s best to trim and adjust the sail shape once all panels are sewn together.


Stick and sew two panels at a time until the sail is all in one piece. You can now trim it to your design on the table and draw on the batten pockets.

, Using dacron tape or reinforced monofilm tape, reinforce the seams. You can also glue a layer of cloth on either side of the material for added strength., There will be a high degree of force applied to these areas so ensure that they can withstand that amount of tension. Depending on the type of sail, attach the luff once you have dealt with the batten pockets., Measure the width of existing sails and adjust your sail accordingly. Sleeves can either be a single piece or made from a number of pieces of material but ensure that the head is reinforced and capable to withstand the strain from the mast tip. Create your sleeve so it fits down to the foot batten.Create an adjustable head for your sleeve if this is your first attempt at a sail.
Use pulleys from old sails or get them from a sail maker.

Insert the key into the ignition.,
Turn the key gently.,
Apply pressure to the steering wheel.,
Do not shake or rock the wheel.,
Pull the key out slightly before turning it.,
Turn the wheel and the key at once to unlock it.",How to Fix a Locked Steering Wheel1," Your steering wheel is likely locked because there was a bit of force on the wheel as you turned the car off last. Unlocking it will require using the ignition key in the same way you would when starting the vehicle.Insert the key into the ignition and see if it will turn.
If the key will turn and start the vehicle, the wheel will unlock with the ignition cylinder.;
, If the key and wheel both remain locked in place, you will need to apply pressure to the key in the direction you would usually turn it. Be careful not to apply the pressure too high up on the body of the key, as that may cause the key to twist or even break while inside the key hole. Instead, apply firm but gentle pressure until the ignition comes unlocked.If you do need to contact an automotive locksmith, it will be much more expensive to repair an ignition cylinder with a broken key inside.
If the key doesn’t turn with slight pressure, applying more will not increase the likelihood of it turning. Instead, maintain light pressure on the key and move on to the next step.

, The steering wheel is locked in place using a pin on one side. When locked, the wheel will not be able to move in either direction freely, but one side will not allow any movement whatsoever (the side with the locking pin). Determine which direction the wheel cannot move, then apply pressure in the other direction while turning the key with your other hand.It is the process of turning the key while applying pressure to the wheel simultaneously that will unlock the steering wheel.
The wheel will only move slightly in the direction opposite the pin, but won’t move at all in the wrong direction.

, You may be tempted to shake the wheel back and forth while attempting to unlock it, but doing so will actually decrease your chances of successfully unlocking the wheel. Instead, apply steady pressure in one direction on the wheel until it unlocks.Shaking the wheel back and forth could damage the locking pin and likely won’t unlock the wheel.

, If the key is beginning to wear out it may not be able to turn in the ignition. You may still be able to engage the pins needed to start the vehicle by inserting the key in all the way, then pulling it back out slightly. Try to pull the key back out 1/16 of an inch, or approximately the width of a nickel, then attempt to turn it again.If this works, the key is likely over worn.
You should still replace the key as soon as you can before it stops working.

, It may take a few tries, but if you apply pressure to the wheel in the right direction while simultaneously turning the key, it will unlock both, allowing the wheel to move freely and the vehicle to start. While it may take a fair amount of pressure, do not force either the wheel or the ignition to turn if they seem like they won’t. It may result in breaking the steering pin, your key, or other internal components.Once the two are unlocked, the vehicle is able to be driven.
If the steering wheel does not unlock, you will need to trouble shoot the problem.

Take a look at your power steering to figure out what you’re working with.,
Check to see if you have “rack and pinion” power steering.,
Determine if you have an older power steering system by looking for the gearbox.,
Check for leaks.,
Use a fluorescent dye kit to locate hard-to-identify leaks.",How to Fix a Power Steering Hose Leak1," There are two main types of PAS and both are driven hydraulically. All power steering systems operate by a pump with a pulley attached. They are belt driven. Pumps will have a fluid reservoir attached, where fluid is checked and added. Hydraulic hoses feed fluid to the steering mechanism that turns the vehicle’s wheels. There are two hoses leading from the pump to the steering box (or rack). One hose is under extreme pressure when the vehicle’s engine is running and the other is a low-pressure return line.


Hydraulic fluid is hazardous and can cause serious skin and eye injuries. Use care when handling and always use hand and eye protection.;
, There are two main types of power steering systems used in automotive vehicles. Modern cars now use a more advanced design called “Rack and Pinion” power steering. This design is identified by a long rack of “gear teeth” and a pinion gear at the end of the steering shaft.


The assembly is shrouded by a steel cylinder that contains the hydraulic fluid and lines and is located directly under the vehicle, near the transmission bell housing.
All front-wheel-drive cars, most small trucks and some SUV’s use this design today.

, When manufacturers introduced power assisted steering, the original design was a hydraulically assisted gearbox called a recirculation ball. Identify this steering type by looking for a steel block with hydraulic lines attached.


The gearbox will be located at the end of the steering shaft and connected to the steering linkage (pitman arm, center link and tie-rod ends), under the front of the vehicle.
This design is still used today, mostly in trucks and heavy equipment.

, Whether the vehicle has rack and pinion or a gear box, hydraulic fluid leaks are common. Both system types develop leaks over time and are addressed much the same way. Fluid leaks are most common at each hose end or along the hose itself. Pumps can develop leaks at the front seal or between the reservoir and pump.


Most leaks can be identified by observing the leak’s path back to its origin.

, Such leaks can be found by adding fluorescent dye to the reservoir and using a black light to easily identify problem areas. These single-use test kits contain fluorescent dye, a black-light flashlight and visually enhanced safety glasses. To use the kit:


The fluorescent dye is added to the fluid reservoir and circulated throughout the system. When the dye leaks out of the problem area, the black light causes the dye to glow brightly, making it easy to identify.
Leak detection kits can be purchased from most auto part stores. Power steering test kits are most helpful when dealing with multiple leaks or when clear visibility is an issue.

Use a small dose of electrical cleaner in the key hole.,
Spray canned air into the ignition.,
Gently slide the key in and out a number of times.,
Ensure the key is not bent or damaged.",How to Fix a Locked Steering Wheel2," If the ignition cylinder has seized, spraying a small amount of electrical cleaner into the key hole may lubricate it enough to turn. Be careful not to spray too much into the key hole. A few short squirts should suffice. Once done, insert the key and turn it back and forth gently to work the lubricant in.If this works, you may need to replace the ignition cylinder soon as it gets progressively worse.
Liquid graphite may also work to lubricate the cylinder.

, Debris caught in the ignition can prevent the key from turning, which will prevent the steering wheel from unlocking. Purchase canned air from a local retail or office supply store and insert the straw from the nozzle directly into the key hole. It should only take a few short sprays to clean out any debris.Put on eye protection before spraying canned air into the key hole to prevent debris from getting into your eyes.

, If there was any debris stuck to the key when you inserted it, it may have gotten caught in the pins of the ignition cylinder. Insert the key completely, then slide it back out. Repeat the process a few times to try to move any debris that may be caught in the cylinder.If this works, the issue will likely continue to occur until the debris is cleaned out from the ignition cylinder.
Use canned air to clean out the lock cylinder if this method worked.

, If your key won’t turn when you insert it into the ignition it may be because the key has been damaged. Rounded or chipped teeth on the key will no longer engage the pins in the ignition cylinder to the depth necessary to spin it. Any of these could result in the key failing to turn in the ignition, which will also prevent the wheel from being unlocked.You will need a replacement key if the key is too damaged to turn the ignition cylinder.
Do not copy a damaged key. A replacement will have to be cut by a dealership that works with vehicles of your make and model.

Purchase a new ignition lock assembly.,
Remove the cover over the ignition.,
Use an Allen wrench to release the ignition assembly.,
Make sure the new ignition switch is well-greased.,
Ensure that the internal lock pins can move freely.,
Slide the cylinder into place and reconnect the switch plug.,
Start the engine to ensure the steering wheel lock disengages.",How to Fix a Locked Steering Wheel3," Ignition assemblies are easily replaced in most vehicles and can be done at home by most hobby mechanics. Before getting started, you will need to order a replacement assembly from your local auto parts store. Be sure to give them the exact year, make and model of your vehicle to get the correct replacement part.Vehicle manufacturers don’t change part numbers often and obtaining the correct replacement from part stores is not usually an issue.
Purchase a new ignition lock assembly prior to the removal of a failed assembly. Compare the two and verify the replacement is an identical match before attempting reinstallation.

, Generally, most vehicles have a split-plastic housing that covers the steering column and ignition lock assembly. Remove this plastic cover by first adjusting the tilt-wheel to its lowest position and then removing the fasteners holding the cover in place. In some vehicles, the cover will include the portion above and below the steering wheel, while in others the ignition cover will be separate.If it's not equipped with an adjustable steering column, remove the steering column support brace under the dashboard and allow the column to hang.
Remove the fasteners from the column cover, separate the two halves and remove the plastic.

, Identify the ignition assembly and remove any trim components that prevent access to the ignition wire harness connector and tumbler release hole. Insert a 9/32” Allen wrench into the release hole while turning the ignition key backward.Use the ignition key to pull the entire assembly out by pulling it toward the passenger side of the car.
Take care to unplug the ignition switch wire connector as you remove the ignition cylinder.

, Once the ignition assembly is removed, compare the new switch and ensure they match. New ignition switches come pre-lubed from the factory ready to install. Verify the presence of grease on all external moving parts and ensure the new key fits and that the cylinder rotates smoothly in both directions.If the ignition cylinder is not properly greased, apply liquid graphite or similar grease to the cylinder.
Purchase grease at your local auto parts store if necessary.

, You can make sure the internal lock pins move properly by inserting the key completely in and out of the keyhole several times. The key should not get caught or stuck on its way into our out of the key hole.Sticking lock pins are lubricated using powdered graphite that is applied directly inside the keyhole.
Graphite comes in small tubes designed to “squirt” the powder with enough force to reach the back of any keyhole. It can be added when needed.

, When satisfied the new assembly matches the old one and is properly lubricated, slide the cylinder into position and make sure it is locked in place. Reconnect the switch plug and reinstall any trim components previously removed.Rotate the cylinder forward using the key until you head it click into place.
Be sure to plug the ignition wire switch into the new cylinder before sliding it into place.

, Before securing the steering column (if disconnected) and plastic cover, check to make sure the engine will start and steering wheel lock will /disengage. Do so by inserting the key and turning it while applying pressure to the wheel in the opposite direction of the lock pin.Steering column bolts usually have torque specifications which are located in the vehicle’s repair manual, in the specification section.
If no torque specs are found, tighten bolts firmly using a long handled ratchet for leverage. Column bolts must be secure to ensure they don’t vibrate loose while driving.

Consult your owner’s manual if you plan on repairing pumps or hoses at home.,
Prepare to make the repairs to your hose or pump.,
Drain the fluid from the damaged hose.,
Install the new hose.,
Bleed out any air bubbles.,
Consult a technician for leaking steering racks and gearboxes.,
Service every system component at the same time.",How to Fix a Power Steering Hose Leak2," Pump or hose replacements and fluid exchange (no flush) can be performed at home if budget restraints prevent a full overhaul. A vehicle-specific repair manual should be consulted prior to repairs in order to verify that the service procedures do not require special tools or equipment.


The manual will also give you some idea of the time it will take to make this repair.

, Each power steering system is unique, and component locations vary. Depending on engine configuration, some vehicles require a service facility with certified technicians. High pressure (HP) hoses that leak should be repaired with the engine off, vehicle raised and fluid drained.


If home service is possible, a vehicle-specific repair manual is necessary to understand specifics. A service manual identifies the following important information: pressure relief procedure, specific fluid type used, special tools needed, draining and refilling precautions, air purge instructions, and information on safety precautions and disposal.
Pipe fittings are constructed of soft metal or brass and use compression fittings which have a locking effect when tightened at the factory. Leaks caused by loose fittings are rare, due to their nature. Using a pair of line wrenches to tighten fittings (procedure described in the next Step) will temporarily slow or stop most leaks.

, When the faulty hose is identified, lift your vehicle and place a drain pan under the hose end. Disconnect the fitting that covers the hole where the hose drains, using two line wrenches. To do this:


Prevent the rack or gear box receiving nut from moving with one wrench and loosen the hose nut with the other. Fluid will drain out once the fitting is removed. Allow the fluid to drain completely into an appropriate container for proper disposal. Once all the fluid is drained, remove the opposite hose fitting and remove the hose.

, Attach the new hose to the fitting from which you removed the old hose. Once the hose is in place, tighten the fittings firmly, using the two line wrenches.


When the hose is fully installed, lower the car and add new hydraulic fluid to the power steering reservoir.

, Fluid needs to fill the system and bleed out any air bubbles. Bleeding is accomplished by starting the engine and turning the steering wheel from lock to lock (far left to far right). Recheck the fluid level and add more fluid until it reaches the fill line on the dipstick.


The purging procedure will normally take a few attempts in order to purge all air from the system. When air is completely purged, test drive the vehicle and recheck for leaks. Also recheck the fluid level.

, Leaky steering racks and gearboxes not under warranty should be repaired by a certified technician. Modern pumps can be repaired with a seal kit and require prior knowledge of hydraulic and mechanical gear operations. Rebuilding with a seal kit is a job for experienced technicians. Pump replacement is usually the preferred method if you're going to do it yourself. Since most power steering pumps and racks or gear boxes are located under the vehicle and require many special tools to service, home repair is not recommended.


An industrial lift, a flush/evacuate machine, pullers, presses and approved fluid disposal are needed to make repairs to pumps, steering racks and gearboxes. High pressure hoses that are leaking must be replaced.

, Every component should be serviced all at the same time in order to save money on near-future repair costs. The entire system is under extreme pressure and leaks are not only inevitable but difficult to service. Complete service in one session is highly recommended, because it can get expensive if you have to tear into the system several times to service or replace various components separately.

Tires that are not properly inflated may actually be the cause of your performance issues, so it's a good idea to check this first. You may not need to do anything else.
Additionally, having your tires inflated properly is important for getting accurate reads on the measurements you'll be taking later.;
, Look in your car's repair manual for details about the proper alignment settings. You should find numbers describing the car's ideal toe, camber, and possibly caster.


Write these numbers down. You may not know what these numbers mean yet, but don't worry, this will be explained in parts 2 and 3. For now, just make sure you transcribe them accurately.

, If your suspension is loose or any parts have worn out, this may also be the cause of your problems. Like tire-pressure issues, problems with your suspension can also throw off your measurements, so it's important to take care of any issues here first.


Drive the car onto a flat area, jack up the front end, and place the car on jack stands. Make sure the steering wheel is unlocked.
The easiest way to check the suspension once the car is lifted is to grip each wheel and shake it, both horizontally and vertically. If you don't feel much movement, your suspension is probably in good shape. If not, this may be the source of your problem.If the suspension is loose, you must replace any worn parts. This could include bad ball joints, rack, bushings, gear boxes, tie rod ends, or steering pads.
Unless you have experience doing suspension work, you will probably need to take your car to a professional mechanic.

, Toe is the amount by which the wheels are closer (toe-in) or further apart (toe-out) at their front edges than at their rear edges, as viewed from above.Depending on your car, your manual will probably recommend either zero toe (equal distance between the front and back) or slight toe-in, which increases stability.Toe is the source of most alignment problems, and the easiest to correct yourself., With the car still up on the jack, hold a pocketknife, thin piece of chalk, or white pencil against the center of tire tread. Hold your hand very still and have an assistant turn the tire one full turn, creating a line around the circumference. Do the same on the other side.


If there is no area on the tire where the tread is flat, you may need to suspend your marking tool with a clamp or similar stabilizer., After you lower the car to the ground, push down on the car above each wheel a few times to allow the car to settle.

, Push the car forward at least 10 feet with the steering wheel unlocked to make sure the wheels are straight.

, With an assistant, take a piece of string or wire and stretch it between the lines on the front of the tires, even with the spindle, and measure the distance on the string. Repeat at the process at the back of each tire.


As long as you use string or wire that does not stretch, you can get a very accurate measurement this way., If the distance in the front is smaller than in the back, your wheels toe-in. If the measurement in the back is smaller, they toe-out. If they are identical, you have zero toe.Rear toe is also important for control and tire life. It is also important to have your front and rear wheels aligned with one another (e.g. parallel).You can measure your rear toe similarly to the front. If your rear toe is out of alignment, you may need to see a professional mechanic. Rear toe should be adjusted before front toe, so if you find a problem with the rear, don't waste time adjusting the front yourself., Camber is the vertical angle of the wheels when looking at the car head on.Wheels that are closer together at the top are considered to have ""negative"" camber, those closer together at the bottom have ""positive"" camber.Depending on your car, the manual will probably recommend slight negative camber, as this increases stability.

, Get a piece of stiff cardboard or wood and cut it into a perfect right triangle (one with a 90 degree angle) that is the same height as your wheels.

, Starting in the front of the car, put the base of the triangle on the ground, perpendicular to the car, and the other side of the 90 degree angle against the center of one of the wheels., There will be a gap between your measuring device and your tire, probably at the top. Measure this with a ruler or calipers. This is your camber.Repeat with the other front wheel. The two wheels should be about the same and within the range specified by your manual. If not, your camber may need alignment. Repeat the process in the back.
If you think the camber is off, move your car forward or backward enough to spin the tires half a turn, then try measuring again.Problems with camber, front or rear, can affect how your car handles.. At the same time, however, unless your car has been in a serious accident, it is unlikely that your camber will be seriously out of alignment.If your camber does need to be corrected, it should be done before adjusting the toe.Camber cannot typically be corrected at home with ordinary tools,and indeed, for some cars it cannot be adjusted at all without bending or replacing major parts.Unless you have experience with automotive repair and professional tools, do not try to adjust this yourself.

, The tie rods are the connection between your steering system and your wheels. The rod ends are L-shaped parts sometimes found near the inside of the wheel.


It's a good idea to look at your car's manual and/or at some pictures on the internet to get a sense of what tie rod ends look like and where exactly they are located on your specific car.

, Between the tie rod and each tie rod end is a nut that holds it in place. You'll need to loosen this nut with a wrench.


Be aware that on some vehicles, the driver's side lock nut may be threaded counterclockwise, while the passenger side is threaded clockwise.Depending on your steering system, there may also be a clamp that needs to be removed at each end to make sure the bellows boot is not sticking to the inner tie rod.Consult your manual for details.
If it has been a long time since you had an alignment, the threaded parts may be stubborn and require some lubrication, such as WD40, in order to make them turn., Depending on the type of steering you have, there are two different ways you can adjust your toe.


If you have rack and pinion steering, you should turn the inner tie rod itself. Spinning the rod will adjust the toe in or out.If you have a parallelogram linkage system, there will be adjusting sleeves that you can turn to adjust your toe. These sleeves can be damaged by this process, so be careful. There are special tools for rotating tie rods which can prevent damage.Whichever system you have, make sure to keep in mind that the change you are making to the toe will be distributed across two wheels. Each tie rod should be adjusted 1/2 of the total desired amount of change in or out.

, Tighten your nuts (and clamps, if applicable) back up. Then, recheck the toe using the same procedures you followed in part 2. Readjust as necessary.


Unless you are well practiced at this, there may be a certain amount of trial and error to get this right.

, Take the car for a drive to verify that any obvious alignment issues have been corrected (e.g. that the car does not pull to one side or vibrate excessively).


If your alignment problems persist, you may have a problem that requires a professional mechanic.

Clean the sunroof trough, located just inside the rubber seal.,
Locate the sunroof drain tubes.,
Blast compressed air through the drain tubes located at the base of the sunroof seal.",How to Fix a Leaky Sunroof1," It is designed to catch water that gets through the sunroof. Wipe it with a cloth to remove any visible debris on the seals and edges of the sunroof.;
, These are very small holes, usually at the corners of the sunroof just under the seal.

, These tubes are designed to carry water that gets through the roof down and out of the car. Tubes can get blocked with dirt and debris over time and need cleaning.

Consider the complexity of your car before beginning and take your car to a trusted repair shop.,
Check for check engine lights or maintenance required lights on the dash board instrument cluster.,
The stall is likely caused by either a problem in the electrical system or in the fuel system.,
Drive the car up and down steep hills.,
Does the car idle roughly and stall when at idle?,
If your car has a distributor, you might consider changing the cap, rotor, wires and plugs.,
If your car diesels when you turn off the ignition, it means that your car most likely has a carburetor and the idle speed adjustment is too high.,
In rare cases, your car may stall due to what is commonly called a ""vapor lock,"" a situation that occurs when the fuel lines supplying gas to the engine become hot enough to boil the gas in the line turning it into vapor.",How to Fix a Car That Stalls," Modern cars (mid-nineties or later) have an ignition and fuel system that are in large part computer controlled, and it will be difficult for you to make any adjustments. You will want to take it into the shop to address this problem.;
, Any fuel or ignition problem in modern CPU controlled engine systems will likely cause a code to be displayed, a check engine light, or maintenance required light to come on. If you are not able to use a scan tool, or don't have access to one, many auto parts retailer offer the use of one free of charge.

, Your engine stops running because it is not igniting fuel in the cylinders. This occurs either because there is not any gas to ignite, or because it lacks the electrical charge to ignite it.


Note that older, carburetor type fuel systems may have too much fuel entering the cylinders, a condition known as flooding.

, Does this change the performance of the engine, or cause it to stall? This might indicate a clogged fuel filter. Replacing the fuel filter can often be relatively cheap and easy once you find out where it is located.


Note that some vehicles have fuel filters located in the gas tank, and can be very difficult to access.
Diesel fuel filters and multi-fuel filters can cost over $100.00, U.S.

, If your car has a distributor, you may need to adjust the timing. With the right tools and know how, this is an easy and free task. If your vehicle has fuel injection, you can check the injector by using a screwdriver or mechanics scope. The injectors will make a clicking/snapping sound if working. No sound may indicate a bad injector. It could also indicate an electrical failure with the circuit that drives the fuel injector. Also, check the Ignition Control Module, which controls the timing of the voltage going to spark plugs, and supplies the spark to ignite the fuel/air mixture.

, This is effectively a tune-up. This can usually be done even by a relative novice to car repair, and take a couple of hours with the right tools. It seems counterintuitive, but even the wires and distributor decay over time, and transmit less electricity. This tune-up may solve your stalling problem — even if it does not, your car should run better and get better mileage afterwards.

, Dieseling describes the situation where you turn off the key, yet the car continues to run for a few seconds or longer, eventually sputtering to a stop. This does not occur on fuel-injected vehicles because when the ignition is turned off so is the fuel supply to the engine as well as the spark plugs.

, Fuel pumps are designed to pump liquid not “vapor” and thus fail to provide enough fuel pressure. However, a clogged fuel tank vent system can cause a vacuum in the fuel line that causes fuel to eventually stop reaching the engine. This also is a problem unique to carbureted engines. Fuel injected engines commonly have ""closed loop"" fuel delivery systems that make this condition unlikely to occur. Try opening your gas cap. If you hear a ""whooshing"" sound, like when you open a can of coffee, it means the gas tank is not venting properly. Now try starting the car. It should work after a couple tries. This is usually found only in older cars. If you have it, this will probably happen again, so your tank vent system should be checked for blockage. More often than not, the problem can be traced to a cheap replacement locking gas cap. A cheap fix is to drill a small hole in your gas cap to allow air in and prevent the vacuum from forming, but the gas cap should not be left this way.

Listen the vehicle when you try to start it.,
Check the battery terminals.,
Test the battery.,
Attempt to jump start the vehicle.,
Test the starter solenoid.",How to Fix a Car That Doesn't Start1," The easiest issue with starting your vehicle to diagnose is often a dead battery. When you turn the key in the ignition, listen to the sound the motor makes as it attempts to start. If it doesn’t make any sound at all, it may simply be a dead battery.If you can hear clicking, it may be because the starter is attempting to work but does not have enough power.
If the engine is turning over but won’t start, it likely isn’t an issue with the battery.;
, Open the hood of the vehicle and look over the connections from the battery to the engine. There are two terminals (positive and negative) and both must have clean metal on metal connections in order to transmit electricity sufficiently. Check to ensure both cables are connected and that the terminals aren’t covered in debris or oxidization.Use a steel tooth brush to clean corroded battery terminals.
Ensure the cables are tight on the terminals and cannot be wiggled or pulled off the battery.

, Once you’ve checked the battery cables, use a voltmeter to test the voltage in the battery. Turn on the voltmeter and touch the positive (red) lead to the positive terminal on the battery, then touch the negative lead to the negative terminal. If the battery is fully charged, it should read between 12.4 and 12.7 volts.If the battery is dead, try jump starting it.
If the battery won’t hold a charge, replace it and try starting the vehicle again.

, If the cables on the battery are secure, use another vehicle to jump start the engine. Connect the two batteries using jumper cables, making sure to use the red cable on the positive terminals and the black cable on the negative terminals.Be sure to connect the positive to the positive and negative to the negative terminals, otherwise you may do serious damage to the vehicle.
Some engines have a main fuse just after the battery that will pop if you accidentally switch the cables. You will need to purchase a replacement fuse if you break it.

, If jump starting the car didn’t work, there may be an issue with the starter or solenoid. Start by testing the starter solenoid using a test light. Touch the test light to the bottom terminal on the solenoid and ground the negative cable on the body of the vehicle. Have a friend attempt to start the vehicle to see if the solenoid engages.If the solenoid does not engage, it has gone bad and will need to be replaced.

Research various automotive certifications.,
Look for affiliations.,
Ask around.,
Check online reviews.,
Look up repair procedures, labor time, and costs online.,
""Stake-out"" your local shops.,
Balance price and convenience.,
Talk to the mechanic, ask questions and request to see the old parts when they are removed.",How to Find a Good Auto Mechanic," Some good mechanics will be ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) Certified and should have a certification indicating what areas he is proficient in. It can be a good indicator of how dedicated the technician is toward learning new things. Note, however, that many highly qualified technicians choose not to take the exams, and passing the exams doesn't mean that a technician will provide good service.;
, AAA will certify some local repair shops after examining their credentials and business policies, and they will have a list of those shops on their website.

, Your friends, family, and colleagues have cars, and have to get them serviced somewhere. Find out how they feel about their mechanics. Many good mechanics don't spend a lot on marketing their services and rely on word of mouth of their customers for new business.

, Look for reviewers' overall impression, without giving too much weight to any single review. An individual reviewer could not be satisfied for any number of reasons beyond the technician's control. You're looking for continuous patterns here, such as not being communicative or explaining charges, performing shoddy repairs, and recommending some clearly unnecessary services.

, Internet sites and discussions can provide ""sanity checks"" on prices, reasons, and time to complete repairs. Keep in mind that prices will differ significantly between different locations, different shops, and different cars. A good mechanic should be able to provide a good ball park figure for them to charge for a repair and the parts needed.

, This means driving past and checking out the facilities. Look for clean, orderly grounds and work areas and people engaged purposefully in their work. Grounds chock-full of cars being actively worked through aren't a bad thing, though perhaps not for you if you have a very valuable car or show-quality finish to protect from even the slightest tap. Take notice of the makes, quantity, and quality of the other customers' cars. If you drive a 5 year old Ford truck, and the only vehicles you see around are run-down, old Fiats in the parking lot that probably isn't the place for you.


Professional drivers are likely to be well-informed, so taxis, limos, or work vans around can indicate a good economical shop.







, Any mechanic should work honestly, effectively, and avoid big surprises on cost or time. Going to a more-expensive shop alone doesn't guarantee anything, but recognize that it legitimately costs more to provide:


Convenient location. It costs more to rent, or forego income by not renting out, space in a fancy or densely-populated area. But, if you live or work in such an area, taking your car here may help you get back to your other activities more quickly.






Some shops, typically fancy ones like dealerships, provide free shuttles. There are many non-expensive areas within short distances from train or bus stops--consider your safety to, from and at those, though. A cab ride to and from a shop in an inconvenient area may be well worth the money you can save on a repair. Occasionally one of the workers may offer you a lift. Call to ask about transit options before going.


New and spacious waiting, office and repair areas. Buildings, like cars, cost money to build and keep shiny. Accumulation of dirt and serious decay can suggest an attitude problem, though.






More time to talk and mitigate unexpected delays. It can sometimes take a lot of time to explain some problems with a level of detail suitable for those not familiar with cars or to deal with unexpected problems that may appear. A shop that does less business overall may have more time to explain things and may introduce less delay for unusual problems because it already has slack in its schedule. If you expect to have something complicated to ask about at a busy shop, be prepared to wait awhile; better yet, ask what times are less busy before going.






More parts on hand. Larger shops, and those that specialize in particular kinds of work or cars, can often save time with parts taken from a comprehensive inventory rather than waiting for them to arrive from elsewhere, though even that can be pretty fast near a city.






All original-equipment-manufacturer (""OEM"") or other new parts. Car manufacturers make, or obtain through their parts suppliers, and sell spare parts that should match the originals perfectly, known as OEM parts. Dealers normally use these. Other, ""aftermarket"" manufacturers, make new replacement parts. ""Re-builders"" or ""re-manufacturers"" take apart and clean complex used parts such as engines and transmissions, replace whatever may have broken, readjust, refit or replace whatever tends to wear out, and reassemble, lubricate, and seal them. Aftermarket and rebuilt parts typically cost much less and are often just as good. There are established aftermarket and rebuilding companies with their own reputations to protect. Junkyards, often called ""salvage"" or ""used auto parts"" companies, are particularly good for saving money on things that don't wear out, like doors and mirrors, but the particular part to be used has to be examined and the appearance normally won't be perfect. Independent mechanics typically use aftermarket parts, and sometimes rebuilt or salvage parts, but should ask before installing something that is not new. You can also bring your own parts to them, but be absolutely sure it is the correct part so that you don't waste your own or your mechanic's time.






An insurer may sometimes waive ""betterment"" charges for replacing old parts that got broken if you agree to have aftermarket parts used. Ask about this if an insurer is paying for your repairs.


Specialization. Many mechanics can do good work on all kinds of common cars. But many parts on antiques work in odd, obsolete ways, and many parts on top-of-the-line luxury cars or exotic cars can work in odd ways to squeeze out a little extra performance. And replacements can be hard to find. So if you have one of these, look for a mechanic who works with similar cars as a substantial part of his business. If the car has collector value, make sure any replacement parts are sufficiently ""authentic"".






Dealerships generally charge quite a bit more for parts and labor than other mechanics, but they're supposed to know your vehicle and be able to get the job done perfectly.







, When a mechanic puts a face to the vehicle and knows he may be talking with you again he is more likely to be more particular about how he performs the repairs.

Locate the carburetor.,
Place a small collection container under the carburetor.,
Once the gas has stopped coming out, turn the screw to the right to close again.",How to Drain the Gas from Your Generator Gas Tank and Carburetor,", Turn it to the position in which it can be pushed back through the plastic cover over the fuel lines. (See the video below for a full example.), This needs to be done in order to make it easier to access the fuel lines. This should be fairly easy to do; there are generally a couple of large bolts holding the cover in place. (See the video below for example of a cover that is on the 6800 Watt Ridgid Generator.)

You will need a wrench or socket wrenches to remove the cover.

, Move the cover out of the way.

Make sure that the fuel valve is set to off. This is so that the fuel valve is closed when you remove one side of the line in the next step.

, Have a rag close by to catch a little gas that is left in the tube you are removing (the tube that runs to the carburetor). Then remove the tube from the fuel valve. You may need to use pliers the first time because it's sealed fairly tightly. Do not disconnect the line that runs to the gas tank, or gas will pour everywhere., This will generally be about 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L). You can use a gas can so that you can put the gas into your car so it doesn't go to waste (see the video for an example)., Let all of the gas drain out into the container until no more comes out. Once you're done, reconnect the fuel line and replace the cover., There will be a screw on the base of the carburetor that is used to open the drain. Sometimes it is labeled on the generator. See your generator's instruction manual to help you locate it., Turn the screw to the left to open the drain hole. Only a small amount will come out., (See the video below for more information; watch the steps carefully.)"

, The wire should move with little resistance through the tube and push any small dirt or debris particles out as it continues.


Take care not to damage the drain tubes with the metal rod. If you feel a lot of resistance even after twisting the metal wire, do not push it any further. If this happens, you will need to have a professional clean the drain tubes.

, Check for leaks inside the car. If there are still leaks, proceed to the next step.

Look for cracks or jagged edges along the sunroof seal.,
Scan the area around the seal for any pooling water or mold.,
Apply black liquid electrical tape to the seal.,
Close the sunroof and pour water over the top again.,
Take the vehicle to a professional service provider if you continue to have problems with the sunroof.",How to Fix a Leaky Sunroof3," Some seals will slowly dry out and crack over time due to exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures.

, Some seals will sag or lose their shape, causing water to build up in the seal's trough. When the water pools, it can eventually create holes in the seal.

, Brush a thick layer of the liquid electrical tape on, making sure it covers cover any visible wear. The tape dries to form a protective, waterproof barrier. Press the tape down around the seal. Let it dry following the liquid tape manufacturer's directions.

, Check inside the car to see if you still have leaks.

, Leaks that are not associated with the drainage tubes or seals are usually factory flaws that can only be fixed by installing a new sunroof.

Add fuel if the vehicle’s out of gas.,
Look for signs of jerking as you drive before it dies.,
Check to see if the vehicle will start again after a few minutes.,
Replace your fuel filter.,
Test your fuel pump.",How to Fix a Car That Doesn't Start2," If the vehicle is extremely low on fuel or out of gas, add some using a red plastic gas container designed to carry and pour gas into a vehicle’s fuel tank. Gasoline eats through many kinds of plastic, so it is very important you use a container intended to transport it. Screw the nozzle onto the large opening on the can, then open the breather cap on the other side before pouring the gas into your vehicle.The breather cap allows air to travel into the can, permitting the gas to pour out into the vehicle’s fuel tank.
Be careful not to spill gasoline on yourself or the paint.

, A common sign of trouble with your vehicle’s fuel system is jerking or inconsistent power while you are driving at a consistent speed, such as on the highway. If you begin to feel the engine delivering intermittent power despite your foot staying in the same place on the throttle, it may be because of an issue with fuel delivery.If the RPMs also drop with the engine’s power delivery, that indicates a fuel problem.
If the RPMs climb as the power fails to reach the wheels, that is usually a transmission problem instead.

, If the engine stalls as you are driving and struggles to start or run again immediately after, try letting it sit for a few minutes and trying again. If the engine starts up and runs properly after sitting for twenty minutes or so, it could be due to a clogged fuel filter.As sediment builds up in a fuel filter, it can block the passage of fuel into the engine.
Once the filter sits for a few minutes, the sediment may settle, allowing fuel to pass through once again.

, Your vehicle may not be getting fuel because the fuel filter is completely clogged. Replace your fuel filter by locating it beneath the vehicle and disconnecting the fuel lines going in and out of it. Remove the filter from the bracket and install a new one to allow fuel to flow to the engine once again.You can purchase replacement fuel filters at your local auto parts store.
A severely clogged fuel filter can lead to burning out your fuel pump.

, There are a few methods you can use to test your fuel pump to see if it is functioning properly. Be sure to check that it is receiving electrical current, then you may want to do a flow test to check the volume of fuel it is sending to the engine.If the fuel pump is not functioning properly, it will need to be replaced.
Refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle for instructions on replacing the fuel pump.

Check your spark plugs for signs of damage.,
Replace spark plugs if need be.,
Check the plug wires.,
Test the ignition coils.",How to Fix a Car That Doesn't Start3," Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs in your engine and look them over to diagnose problems that may exist. Remove each plug and inspect them for specific types of damage that may indicate what’s keeping the engine from starting.Tan or grey metal plugs are in good working order.
Black or burnt plugs indicate that there is too much fuel going into the engine.
Blisters or boiling on the plug indicates that the engine was severely overheated.

, If the spark plugs appear to be fouled out, you will need to address the issue that caused them to foul in order to make the engine run properly. Once done, replace the damaged spark plugs with new ones.Make sure to gap new spark plugs properly for your application.
You can find the appropriate gap to put into the plug in the service manual for your vehicle.

, Ensure each of the spark plug wires is securely fastened to the spark plug and to the ignition coil. You can also use an ohm meter to conduct a spark plug resistance test to ensure the plug wires are transmitting sufficient electricity to the spark plugs to ignite the air and fuel mixture within the engine.Look for signs of damage such as fraying or cracks in the spark plug wires.
Replace any damaged spark plug wires even if they are not what’s keeping the engine from starting.

, Although unlikely, if all of your ignition coils fail to function it will prevent the engine from starting. Test your ignition coils by removing a spark plug and connecting it again to its plug wire. Touch the metal from the plug to a piece of metal in the engine bay and have a friend turn the key in the ignition.If the coil is functioning properly, you will see a blue spark come from the plug.
Test each ignition coil in your engine.

Turn the car, fan, and the AC all the way off.,
Spray your disinfectant into every single vent.,
Turn the car on and the AC to max power, full blasting fan.,
Find your re-circulation vent and spray into it generously, with the AC still running.,
Switch the AC from ""max"" to full fan mode.,
For serious issues, lift the hood, replace the cabin air filter and spray down all the intake lines.,
Run the car, doors open, with the AC off and the fans on full for five minutes.,
Take the car to your dealer if the smell persists.",How to Eliminate Odor from a Car Air Conditioner1," Specialty sprays may be the best bet for serious odors, but for smaller problems (or to stay ahead of potential smells) you can use an over-the-counter disinfectant spray like Lysol.;
, Mix up one part white vinegar with three parts water, then put it in an old spray bottle or solvent sprayer. While vinegar isn't the most pleasant smell, it will fight the mildew naturally and it will fade off quickly.


Throw in the juice from half a lemon to get a slightly fresher and longer lasting scent., Flick both switches into the off position and make sure the car isn't running.

, Make sure you get in the backseats and hit the vents at your feet, which often pump the most air. There are also vents on the dashboard, and usually one on the pointing on the back windshield as well.


Keep the doors closed as you do this. You want the cleaning fluid to get in the system.

, This will start to circulate air around the system for you, getting your cleaning solution around the AC system. Keep it on this ""Max"" setting at first to kick the system into gear.

, You can find your re-circulation vent by checking your manual. It is often on the drivers side floor, near the console, or in the trunk. The little button with arrows pointing a circle tells your car to stop taking air from the outside, and instead recycle the air from the inside. Press this button if you have it, then spray down this vent to make sure your cleaning fluid is staying in the system.

, You want to be blowing more air, not cooling more air. This should prevent additional moisture from coming in.

, If you have nasty odors coming from the car and no way to stop them, grab your owner's manual and lift the hood. The AC system is back towards the windshield, under the plastic grate and filter where (different models have different methods -- you must check your manual), and remove the filter, cleaning and replacing when necessary.While there, spray the whole apparatus down with your cleaning aerosol to fight and kill any mold or mildew.

, This is your final ""drying out,"" and it will prevent mold and mildew from reestablishing your old odors., If the smell still won't go away, don't ignore it. It won't get any better on its own. Take it to the dealer to make sure the smell is not the cause of something more serious, and to handle the problem before it becomes worse than just a bad smell."

Determine the problem with your horn.,
Pop the hood and have someone press the horn if it is sounding at low volume.,
Locate the horn or horns on the radiator core support or behind the car's grille.

,
Remove the wire connector.,
Purchase a replacement horn if cleaning the horn parts does not fix your reduced sounding car horn.,
Check the fuse box if your horn will not make any sound.,
Remove the fuse with a pair of tweezers, needle-nosed pliers, or a pair of regular pliers.,
Replace the fuse if it is faulty.,
Check to see if the airbag light is illuminated on the dashboard if there is no problem with your fuse.,
Take your vehicle to a professional mechanic if the airbag light is illuminated.",How to Fix a Broken Car Horn," Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix.

, Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working.

,, The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again.

, You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn.

, Read your owner's manual to find the location of your car's fuse box. Your owner's manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn.;
, You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken.

, You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again.

,


A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself.

,


If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.

Turn off your AC 4-5 minutes before stopping the car.,
Keep the fans on high as the car shuts down.,
Blast the fans on high, doors open, once a year on a hot, dry day.,
Spray down the ducts with disinfectant every 3-6 months if you live in a hot humid area.",How to Eliminate Odor from a Car Air Conditioner2," This gives the evaporator time to dry off excess moisture (key for mildew/mold growth) using the hot air from the engine. No moisture means no mold, which means no smell!, With the AC off, keep the fans blasting to make sure a lot of air hits the evaporator and removes any mildew, moisture, or mold spores from taking root.


Note -- this is a way to prevent further growth. It will likely not help remove the actual smell if it is already there.

, This can prevent all mold from ever getting a foothold. Remember that the AC, not the fan, creates the moisture that spawns mold. The fan will just heat it up from the hot car motor (hopefully killing it) and then remove it from the AC evaporator., Warm, wet environments are paradise for mold and mildew. Furthermore, the more you use your AC, the more likely it is to grow dirty. Keep on top of the issue with regular cleanings, as noted above.

Determine whether you have a leak in your exhaust system.,
Replace your catalytic converter.,
Replace your fuel filter.,
Determine whether you've flooded the car.,
Check fuel lines and hoses.",How to Diagnose Car Smells1," Smelling exhaust in a car is an incredibly dangerous situation because carbon monoxide is toxic for human beings. So if you smell exhaust within your car, get the car checked out by a professional immediately.


There could be a hole in anything from the muffler to the tailpipe of your car.
It’s also possible that exhaust is leaking into the car through a part of the interior that is worn. Don’t play around with this scenario. It’s extremely dangerous.;
, If you smell a sulfur or rotten eggs smell, you’re probably going to need to get your car serviced by a professional.Usually, the smell of sulfur indicates there is a problem with your catalytic converter. The converter will probably need to be replaced.
The way this is done is to cut the converter on both ends after the engine cools. Then, replace it with a new converter.

, It’s also possible that the converter is just plugged up, but most likely you are going to have to replace it.


Other causes of rotten eggs smells can include hot engines or broken fuel pressure regulators. All you might need to do for the latter is replace your fuel filter.
A rotten eggs smell is probably the result of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur is present in gasoline, and it’s converted to sulfur dioxide, which is odorless. However, when your converter breaks down or its filtering layers are worn out, sulfur produces a strong smell of rotten eggs., Gasoline smell signals a problem with the car. However, it might be easy to fix if the car is just flooded.


If the car isn’t starting, flooding is a distinct possibility. Just wait a few minutes, and try to start the car again.
If the gas smell seems to be emanating from underneath your hood, your fuel injection system or carburetor might be leaking fuel. You can also check your fuel pump for a streak of leaking gasoline, which should be clearly visible.

, You will also want to check the fuel lines and hoses inside your hood that lead to the fuel tank. It’s possible they’re disconnected or rotted.


You might want to check under the hood again after parking the car overnight. You will want to look for stains because gasoline evaporates pretty quickly.
Make sure not to smoke cigarettes while looking for gasoline leaks. This can be very dangerous. It’s also possible that you spilled some gasoline while pumping it into your car. Maybe the gasoline you smell is that which dropped onto your hands!

Lighten up on the clutch and brakes.,
Check to see if your engine is overheating.,
Check for a loose hose.,
Check to see if your coolant is leaking if you smell maple syrup.",How to Diagnose Car Smells2," If you smell burning toast while you’re working the gears of the car, this is probably an issue with your clutch. But it could also be your break pads.


You could be riding the clutch pedal too hard, which creates friction between the clutch facing and the clutch slips. If you lighten up on it, the smell should disappear. The material is made of paper, which is why the smell has the faint odor of burning paper.
If you’re pressing your brakes too hard, you might be overheating your brake pads. This can also cause a burning smell. It could help to downshift. You also could have a dragging brake because a brake caliper piston might have seized. Another possibility is to make sure you didn’t leave your handbrake on while driving.
One way to check the brake pads is to see if any of your wheels feels hot. If none of them does, then maybe it's the overheated clutch instead of a dragging brake shoe.

, Figure out why you smell oil burning. Burning oil has an odor that is thick and acrid. When you smell it, you need to determine right away whether you are running out of oil.


Another possibility is that your engine is overheating. If neither one of these things seems to be the answer, check to see if there is oil leaking onto your engine block. You may need an oil change if you are smelling burning oil.
You could also check your transmission fluid using a dipstick. Maybe your transmission fluid is low. This can cause it to burn in the transmission because the gears get too hot because they are not properly lubricated.

, If the smell is closer to rubber burning than oil burning, check to see if a hose came loose under your hood.


It’s possible that it’s touching a part of the hot engine. Sometimes an oil smell is from a leaking crankshaft seal.
If that’s the case, you’ll also find oil on the pavement beneath the car most likely., If the car smells like maple syrup after you’ve warmed up the engine (or even after you’ve shut it off a few minutes later), you should take immediate action.


This smell might mean that your coolant is leaking from somewhere like a radiator or heater hose. This kind of a problem means it's a good idea to take your car into a professional.
If you smell maple syrup outside the car, this might mean that you have a leaking radiator cap or that the radiator itself has a leak. If you smell it inside your car instead, this might mean that your heater core has gone bad."

Get rid of other common smells in your car.,
Protect your car from growing smells.,
Shampoo your car regularly.,
Diagnose the odor as mildew.,
Remove other causes of car mildew.,
Get rid of the moisture that's causing the mildew.",How to Diagnose Car Smells3," If your car smells are unpleasant but aren’t a sign of mechanical malfunction, there are ways you can make your car smell better.


Try baking soda. This will remove odors from carpet. Maybe some food spilled on the carpet. Remove what you can, and then sprinkle baking soda on it. Rub it in. Leave it for a couple of hours, and then vacuum it up.Charcoal also absorbs smells. If you leave a chunk of grilling charcoal in the car for a couple of days, the charcoal will absorb a lot of the car smell.
You could also put vanilla or another scent on cotton balls, and leave them in your car. Or you could put a container of ground coffee in the car.
To deal with the smell of cigarettes, open your hood and spray air deodorizer in the intake valve. This is necessary because cigarette smoke also enters your car’s duct system.

, Use a little preventative maintenance so that bad smells don’t take over your car.


This can be as simple as vacuuming your car regularly to remove dirt that’s been tracked in it or food crumbs that have spilled.Don’t let trash accumulate in your car. Keep a small plastic bag in the car to immediately deposit trash inside, and throw it away every few days (or even every day).

, If you've got a problem with food or drink spills, it's a good idea to shampoo your car's floor mats or seats.


Remove floor mats, and shampoo them immediately if food spills on them. Just take detergent and water, and scrub them. You can also buy car upholstery shampoos in many auto stores.
It's a good idea to test the detergent on a small spot first. You can also use carpet cleaner, and a wet/dry shop vac. Just spray the carpet cleaner on the seats. Vacuum it up., One of the most common odors in a car is mustiness. It can smell like old gym socks. Just hanging up an air freshener won't permanently eliminate the problem.If you smell this odor, especially when you turn on your heater or your air conditioner, it’s probably mildew that grew because moisture condensed inside your air conditioner.
The key is to dry out the air conditioning system. You can do this by turning off your air conditioner and running the fan on high for about a mile.

, You’re not going to be able to camouflage this one with a bunch of air fresheners. You’ll have to get at the root of the problem, which is likely moisture or humidity inside the car.Look for condensation inside the car. Remove the floor mats to see if they appear wet. Look in the trunk and in the spare tire storage space. It’s also possible that the air conditioning filter is causing the musty smell. See if the floor mat is wet near the air conditioner.
If you smell the odor from the floor or trunk, remove all floor mats. If the smell is coming from the air conditioner, remove the filter in it. Just open up the front cover of the unit to remove the filter.

, Take a rag, and wipe off any moisture that you can find. If you see any mildew or mold on the area, use a nylon scrub pad to remove it. Try not to scratch the car.


Now you will need to dry the area to remove the moisture causing the smell. You can use a hair dryer if the area is small enough or a wet vacuum for larger areas. You could use a cotton swab in the air conditioner.
You might want to apply anti-mildew solution to the area. Dry any of the floor mats you removed, and then put baking soda on them. Let them hang outside for 24 hours, vacuum, and put back in the car."

Eliminate tire problems.,
Examine your front-end alignment.,
Road test your vehicle.,
Check for abnormal wear on the tires.,
Have your front end checked and realigned and repeat the tests to make sure it has been done correctly.

",How to Diagnose an Alignment Problem," Before attempting to diagnose a front end alignment problem, you need to be sure your tires are not causing steering problems you may be experiencing.


Check the air pressure on all four tires, making sure to inflate them to the recommended pressure. You should find the manufacturer's recommended inflation pressure on the label attached to the driver's side door.
Check to see that the tread (or tire pattern) and tire size are the same on both front wheels. You do not want to have a mud and snow tire on one side and a normal highway tire on the other side. This, or any combination of different tire types or sizes, can cause the car to pull one way or the other.
Check to see if the tires are showing unusual wear or are damaged. Look over the tire completely. Does it look symmetrical, round? Are there chunks missing from the tread? Carefully feel around the tire with your hand to see if there are deformities or bulges, indicating the tread is trying to separate from the steel belts.;
, There are different aspects to front end alignments for rear wheel drive vehicles. You may observe serious alignment problems with a tape measure and a two foot level by checking them. These are:


Toe-in. The front of each tire, when driving straight, points slightly to the centerline of the vehicle. This gives an advantage when cornering so each tire has equal traction (bite), but if it is angled inward (positive) too much, the OUTSIDE of the tire's tread wears more quickly. Measuring the front and rear distances between the centerline of the tires will give you an idea of how much toe-in your vehicle has.
Castor. This is the vertices angle of the centerline of the tire from front to back. This angle is best checked with an automotive shop's front end equipment, but unless the ball joints, control arm bushings, or king pins are seriously worn, the castor doesn't vary too much.
Camber. This is the vertical angle of the centerline of the tire perpendicular to the cross-section of your car. You can park your car on a level surface, and using a 2x4 attached to the a builder's level, check to see if they are plumb. Make sure you are measuring from the rim and not the tire itself, as it can be affected by tire bulge.

, Drive on a flat, level, smooth highway and do the following tests:


Let your grip on the steering wheel loosen enough to let the car proceed on its own while driving down a fairly straight road on a day when the weather is dry and the wind calm. You may need an alignment if the car pulls to the left or right.
Check the sounds from the front end of the car. Driving slowly, listen for scraping, whining, or grinding sounds. These may indicate excessive friction as the tire tread rubs against the road, or other problems.
Have someone follow you at a moderate speed to observe the front to back wheel alignment. If the front wheels are not tracking in the same groove as the back, you may have a bent frame. This is applicable to a vehicle with a solid axel in the rear.
Drive the car in a weaving pattern in an empty parking lot while someone observes the wheels. They may notice unusual leaning in the tires, or hear wheel bearings making noises, indicating problems.

, You may have an alignment problem if the inside or outside of the front tires are worn. Other causes of uneven or unusual wear may include the following conditions:


Worn struts or shock absorbers can cause tires to bounce while driving, creating dishing in the tread.
Worn out or loose wheel bearings can cause the tire to lean, since the bearings are what keeps the wheel assembly in position on the vehicle's spindle.
Worn or damaged tie-rod ends, ball joints, upper and lower control arm bushings (or kingpins, depending on the vehicle), and other steering components.
A worn or damaged steering gear box or pit man arm.
Poor driving habits like hard cornering, braking, or swerving can also cause tire damage or unusual wear over the life of a set of tires.

Turn the air conditioning on while the car is running.,
Listen for unusual noises coming from the AC.,
Feel the air coming out of the vents.,
Notice the air pressure.,
Smell the air coming from the vents.,
Inspect your car’s fuses.",How to Diagnose a Non Working Air Conditioning in a Car1," The air conditioner won’t run properly unless your engine is running. The best setting for diagnosis is “fresh air” (not recirculated) with the air blowing out of the center vents in the dash and the AC turned on.


Start with the fan speed turned to its highest setting.
If your car has a “Max AC” setting, select that option.;
, Noise could indicate that there is a problem with your compressor and that it needs repair or replacing.








, You will need to know if the air is cold, room temperature, or hotter than the air around it. Also note if it starts cold but turns warmer, or if it is usually warm but blows cold intermittently.








, Turn the air pressure to the high and low settings and see if the airflow changes like it normally does.








, If there are unusual smells, you could have a leak. You may also need to change your cabin air filter.







, Check your owner’s manual for the location of your car’s fuse panel, as it may be under the hood, in the trunk, or even in the driver’s foot well area. A blown fuse can cause your AC to stop working.

Check all of the vents.,
Look at your cabin air filter.,
Check for a blower motor problem.",How to Diagnose a Non Working Air Conditioning in a Car2," Be sure that air pressure is coming out of the vents that you have selected. Move the vent selector to see if the air moves to the proper vents.









If changing the selected vent does not alter the flow of air, you likely have a blend door problem, which will require replacing the doors inside the dash that determine the direction of the air flow.Blend doors change position when the temperature selection is changed, blocking the flow or permitting the flow of either hot or cold air.
Sometimes an AC system with a mode door problem could be working fine, but the air flow is being directed somewhere else, like back out to the engine, instead of into the car.

, Especially if the air coming from your vents smells funny or if you think you have had a slow decrease in pressure for some time, check the air filter. You will be able to see if it has a buildup of dirt or debris on it.








It is possible that your cabin air filter is so blocked that it is interfering with your air pressure, and replacing it will be a relatively easy an inexpensive fix to your problem.
Your car manual may have instructions on replacing the cabin filter. If it doesn’t, try searching online for “replace cabin air filter” followed by the year, make, and model of your car (for example, you might search for “replace cabin air filter for 2006 Toyota Camry”).

, The easiest way to do this is to try turning on your heat. If you have weak air flow when the heat is on as well, your blower motor may have gone out.








A blower motor may have a resistor problem if your air only blows on the high setting but will not blow on a lower setting.Unfortunately, mice and other rodents sometimes build homes in car HVAC hoses and can get caught in the blower motor when the car is started. A loud noise (or bad smell) coming when the heat or air are running could be a sign of this problem."
"
Find the front of your AC condenser.,
Look under the hood at the AC compressor clutch.,
Check the tension on the belt of the compressor.,
Find any coolant system leaks.,
Check for freezing.",How to Diagnose a Non Working Air Conditioning in a Car3," It is normally located in front of your radiator. If there are leaves or other dirt or buildup blocking it, remove them and clean the area.







, If your air pressure is normal but the air is hot, you may have a compressor problem. Checking to see if the compressor clutch is engaging is a simple visual inspection. The compressor is usually located towards the front of your engine, just inside the grill of your car.









Your car should be running with the AC on to check the compressor clutch.
The compressor looks like a small motor with a large wheel on the end. The wheel (which is the compressor clutch) should be spinning. If it is not spinning, you have a problem with your compressor., It should be tight. If it is loose, you need a new compressor belt.







, One of the most common AC temperature problems is low refrigerant. The AC system is closed, so refrigerant should not be lost unless there is a leak.








Look for oily residue on or around hoses that attach AC components together. Oily spots may indicate a refrigerant leak.
You may consider using an electronic leak detector, which can detect much smaller quantities of refrigerant.
There are also some testers that use dye, UV light, and protective glasses to find leaks.
If you do find a leak, you will likely need to hire a professional to repair the leak. You will probably need new parts too, as many of the components cannot be repaired or patched.

, If your AC blows cold initially but then stops being cold after some use, it could be freezing. Excess air and moisture in the system may lead components to freeze (literally).








Freezing can also be caused by an oversaturated receiver/drier or accumulator.
Turning the system off for a while and letting it thaw will temporarily solve the problem.
If the problem is persistent, you may need your system to be flushed or evacuated with a vacuum pump.

Look for stalling, no power when accelerating.,
Look under the car at night after the vehicle has been running for a while.",How to Determine Why a Car Stalls at Intersections2," The check engine light will likely be on.

, If the catalytic converter is glowing, it's probably clogged. You will have to replace the converter if you find this to be the problem.

"
Look for initial idle OK after a cold engine start-up, but a warm engine idle will surge and stall.

,
Take your car in to get a reading.",How to Determine Why a Car Stalls at Intersections3,", After a few thousand miles of this, most cars will turn on the ""check engine"" light. You can take it to any AutoZone, Advance auto parts, Napa, or O'Reilly's (but some places may only check cars made after 1996, so call and check first) and they will read the codes for free. There can be any number of reasons for the ""check engine"" light to come on, so it is good to check. Codes complaining of unexpected lean mixture is a good indication of O2 sensor failure. O2 sensors will typically last 60–75K miles. The good news is that you can buy an O2 sensor on-line for around $50 and they are generally pretty easy to replace. Another possible reason is that the engine is idling too low (the idle is adjustable) or the control module is going out, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to access and fix.

Give yourself time to work.,
Keep formulated de-icer on hand.,
Spray windows from the top down.,
Scrape and brush off the ice.,
Clear all of the ice from each window.,
De-ice and test the windshield wipers.,
Check other areas.",How to De Ice a Car1," Once winter rolls around, adjust your morning routine to allow time to de-ice. Start setting your alarm to go off at least ten minutes earlier than normal. This way you can do a thorough job without feeling rushed (and potentially botching the job!)., There are a couple of household ingredients that you can potentially use as a homemade substitute, but only use those as a last resort. For the best results, go with a product that was specifically designed to do the job without damaging your car in any way. Always stock up on some professionally-made de-icer before winter arrives.De-icer can be found online, at auto parts stores, and the automotive sections at stores like Walmart and Target.
Be sure to keep one can of de-icer in your car just in case it ices over somewhere other than home., Give your windshield and other windows a generous spray of your de-icer. Start at the top and then work your way down to the bottom. This way the de-icer will start running down the windows, which means it will cover more ice without you having to waste more product., Definitely use an ice scraper for this, and not some other tool. Again, you want to protect your windows from damage, so use a tool that’s meant for this specific job. Apply plenty of pressure with each stroke, and scrape as far as you can reach in one long, continuous motion. Don’t chip away over one tiny area, because this could scratch the glass underneath. Use the scraper’s brush end (or a separate brush if it doesn’t have one) to clear the loose ice off the window.If the ice is being stubborn, spray it with more de-icer to loosen it up instead of hacking away at it.
If your reach is short, choose a scraper with a nice long handle to extend it further., Once you’ve cleared the driver’s side, you may feel the urge to just leave the passenger-side of your windshield and all the other windows as they are if you’re in a rush. Fight that urge and take the time to remove all the ice. Keep in mind that local laws may require you to do this. Even if they don’t, take the time anyway. Don’t limit your field of vision when driving., Now that all the ice has been cleared from the windshield, make sure the wipers haven’t frozen to them. Spray the wipers with de-icer if necessary so you can raise them. Then spray some de-icer into a cloth and rub it over the wipers’ blades. Set the wipers back down into place.When you start the car, turn them on to make sure they function normally., Your windows are the most obvious things that need to be cleared, but keep in mind local laws probably state that others need to be, too. Once the big job is done, scan your car to see if ice or snow is blocking anything else that needs to be uncovered. If needed, de-ice your:Tail and headlights

Make an alcohol solution.,
Make a vinegar mix if necessary.,
Run your wipers afterward.",How to De Ice a Car2," If you find yourself without any professionally-made de-icers handy, go with rubbing alcohol, which is arguably the most effective substitute (and risk-free as far as damaging your car goes).Mix one part water with two parts alcohol, fill a spray bottle with that, and use it just like you would with a store-bought spray can.If you’re really in a pinch, you can also mix the same ratio of water with hard liquor instead., If you don’t have any alcohol on hand, try distilled white vinegar instead. Combine one part water with three parts vinegar. Then fill your spray bottle and go to work on that ice. Just be aware that:This solution may not be as effective as the alcohol. It could require more elbow grease and repeated applications.Vinegar can potentially damage the glass, as well as your car’s paint if they come into contact.

, Once you get the ice off, try to remove as much of your homemade solution as possible. Start your car and give your windshield a squirt of wiper fluid. Then run the wipers to remove both that and the solution so it doesn’t linger and potentially ruin the glass."

Even though the garage probably gets pretty cold at night, your car will be exposed to far less moisture in there, so ice shouldn’t accumulate., If you don’t have a garage, don’t worry. Prevent ice from building up on your windows by blocking them from the elements. Use a car cover, tarps, towels, or even cardboard as a barrier between the glass and moisture., If it’s pretty much guaranteed that your car is going to be iced over in the morning, give it a preventive treatment the night before. Spray the windows with your de-icer. Melt the ice as soon as it accumulates without having to get out of your warm cozy bed., This can be a waste of fuel and money (not to mention causing more air pollution), so don’t make a habit of this. But if you’re short on time, start the car and turn the heat on. Warm the glass up from the inside while you work on the outside."

",How to Install Neon Lights,";
, Pull off the negative battery cable. This is a safety precaution since you will be doing electrical work.

, Do not attempt to place neon lights near brake lines, fuel lines, electrical lines, hot areas, moving parts, or areas where a lift jack may be used to raise the vehicle.

, Go under the vehicle, and do a test fitting with the neon tubes. Reference the kit diagrams for optimal placement.

, Sometimes visible tubes are against the law.

, Mount the small plastic or metal brackets, which are included in the kit, onto the tubes. Lift the tubes back onto the chassis, and carefully mark the position where you will be drilling holes. Center-punch each hole to get a head start on your drilling.

, Apply a small amount of silicone sealant to the holes before placing the screws into them. This can help to prevent rust.

, Hold each bracket in place, and screw them in until they barely hold the brackets. You will finish securing the screws later. Position all the wires that come from the side tubes so that they face toward the front of the vehicle.

,, Oftentimes the transformer is located near the battery. You will need to drill mounting holes, so be absolutely certain that you will not damage anything under the area you will be drilling. The kit you purchased will have detailed instructions on how to mount the transformer.

, You will probably use solder, silicone sealant, and shrink-wrap tubing.


If the instructions call for cutting and/or joining of wires, strip back the wires you will be joining about .25 inch (0.6 cm), slip shrink-wrap tubing over 1 end of each wire, solder the stripped ends of the wires together with a soldering gun, add a small dab of silicone sealant to the soldered area, and slide the shrink-wrap tubing over the entire wire. Use a heat gun to make the shrink-wrap tubing form a watertight seal over the joined wires.

, You must attach an in-line fuse no more than 18 inches (45.7 cm) away from the battery. Connect the transformer's earth wire, which is also called the negative ground wire, by screwing it into the vehicle chassis to complete the power circuit.

, Run the wiring for the switch through a grommet in the firewall that goes into the engine compartment so that it can be connected to the battery. Make sure the switch and fuse are connected between the transformer and battery and not to the side of either.

Place masking tape over any areas you don't want to spray.,
Apply the spray tint.,
Apply the clear coat.,
Sand the tail lights again.,
Apply some rubbing compound.,
Polish and wax the lights.,
Replace your tail lights.",How to Tint Tail Lights1," In order to spray your taillight you will first need to remove them from the car. To do this, open the trunk and pull back the carpet liner. There should be two bolts securing the back of each taillight. You will need to remove these. Before you can pull the tail lights out completely, you will need to disconnect the bulbs. You can do this by pulling out the prongs that connect them to the light. This may take some force. Now you can completely remove the tails lights.;
, Before spraying your taillight, you will first need to sand them to provide a completely smooth surface for the spray tint. Wet a piece of 800 grit sandpaper and rub it against the taillight until the surface is dull and scuffed up. You can use a little dish soap if you like. Repeat the sanding process for each taillight. When, you're done, wipe the lights clean with a cloth or some paper towel and allow them to dry. Check to see if you have sanded the surface of the lights evenly.


Next, take a piece of 1000 grit sandpaper and repeat the sanding process with it. When you're done, wipe the taillight clean and allow to dry.
Finally, take a piece of 2000 grit sandpaper and sand the lights a final time, using smooth, firm strokes. Clean the lights and allow them to dry. The lights should now feel completely smooth and have a hazy, cloudy color.
Give the lights a wipe down with some cleaning product - such as rubbing alcohol, gasoline, or window cleaner - and allow the lights to dry.
A good tip when using the sandpaper is to let it soak in some water before sanding - this will make the paper more flexible and easier to use.

, In most cases this will be the reverse light, which must remain untinted according to several state laws. Regardless of the law, tinting your reverse lights may make it very difficult to see when driving at night, so if you choose to leave it uncovered, stick masking tape to the correct area and use a sharp utility knife to give the tape a clean line on either side.


One alternative option, if you'd rather tint your whole light, is to purchase some aftermarket lights, which you can plug into the trailer hitch. This will provide you with the extra light you need for reversing at night, but will not ruin the effect of your tinted tail lights., Once the lights are completely dry and you have masked off the applicable areas (if necessary), place the tail lights on a stable work surface to begin the spraying process. Give the can of spray tint a vigorous shake, then hold it about seven inches away from the light, for best coverage. Spray a light, even layer all over both tail lights, making sure both lights achieve the same color. Leave this first layer of tint to dry for 20 to 30 minutes.


Once the first layer of tint is dry, you can apply a second layer of tint. When you are done, let the lights stand for 20 to 30 minutes until they are dry to the touch. Then apply a third layer of tint and let that dry completely. In the majority of cases, three coats of spray tint will be enough to achieve the desired level of tinting.
When you are happy with the level of tinting, leave the lights outside in the sun to cure for 45 minutes to an hour. This step is optional, but will give you a better idea of what your finished tail lights will look like.
Remember to remove any masking tape before moving on to the next step.

, The process of applying the clear coat is very similar to applying the spray tint. Once the final layer of spray tint has dried and you have cured the tail lights, place the taillight back on the work surface and spray them with a light layer of clear coat. You can use a clear coat with a glossy finish, if you like. Once you have finished spraying, allow the clear coat to dry for about 20 minutes before applying the next layer.


Although some tinting professionals claim that 3 to 5 layers of clear coat should be enough, others argue that you should apply between 7 and 10 layers for the best results. This provides better protection for the spray tinting.Make sure to allow each layer of clear coat to dry completely between applications. This is the part where most people become impatient and attempt to apply the clear coat too quickly. However, this can ruin your tint job because if the clear coat isn't allowed to dry completely between applications the coating can start to run.

, Once the tail lights are completely dry (this may take a couple of hours) you will need to repeat the sanding process. Make sure to soak the sandpaper in water first, and this time use gentler strokes, making sure each stroke is going in the same direction.


Use the 800 grit sandpaper, then the 1000 grit sandpaper, followed by the 2000 grit sandpaper.
When you are done, the tail lights should have a light, hazy finish.

, Once the tail lights have been evenly sanded, get some rubbing compound and apply a generous amount to an application pad or clean cloth. Apply the rubbing compound evenly over the tail lights using a wiping motion. Then use a vigorous circular motion and some elbow grease to really work the rubbing compound into the tail lights, to fill in all of the fine scratches caused by the sanding.

, Once you have finished applying the rubbing compound, wipe your tail lights down with a microfiber cloth, then use the same technique to apply a polishing compound. Give the lights another wipe down, before applying the wax product of your choice.

, Once your tail lights have been waxed, they are ready to be reinstalled in your vehicle. Remember to reconnect the light bulbs before sliding the lights into place, then secure the bots and replace the carpeting. Now the only thing left to do is to take a step back and admire your handiwork!

Pull over to the side of the road and shut off the engine.,
Check the oil level with the dipstick.,
Look for signs of a leak.,
Add oil if it’s low and check the oil light.,
Do not drive the vehicle if the oil light comes back on.",How to Respond When Your Car's Oil Light Goes On1," When your engine oil light comes on, you should look for a safe opportunity to pull the vehicle over immediately. Continuing to run the engine with insufficient oil to lubricate the moving parts can result in catastrophic damage to the internal components of your engine, but your safety and the safety of those around you should be your first concern. Shut the car off as soon as you are safely on the side of the road.Pull the vehicle over and shut it off as quickly as you can do so safely.
The longer the engine runs with low oil pressure, the greater the likelihood that damage is occurring inside the engine.;
, Once you are safely on the side of the road, pop the hood and check the oil level in your vehicle’s engine using the dipstick. Locate the dipstick in the engine bay and remove it, wipe off the oil that is on the indicator at the end of the dipstick using a rag or napkin, then slide the dipstick back into the tube it came from. Now remove the dipstick again and look at the amount of oil on the indicator.Look at how far up the indicator the wet oil line reaches.
Each line below the “full” line indicates a quart of oil the engine is low.
If the oil line reaches the second line below the “full” line, it means the engine is short two quarts of oil.

, If there was the appropriate amount of oil in your engine before, but the level is now far too low, it means the oil either leaked out of the vehicle or was burned by the engine due to an internal leak. Look under the car for any indications of an oil leak. If you see oil dripping down from the engine below the car, it likely means a gasket has ruptured or the oil filter is not securely fastened to the vehicle.Be careful, the oil leaking from the engine is likely extremely hot.
If you do not see any signs of a leak and the oil level was not too low, the problem may not be a lack of oil, but a lack of oil pressure.

, Your oil light may have come on because there wasn’t enough oil in the system to maintain adequate oil pressure. Purchase the same kind of oil the vehicle already has in it, paying attention to the weight of the oil (5w30, 10w30, etcetera) and add enough to bring the dip stick oil indicator back to full. Start the engine, and see if the oil light is still on.If the oil light stays off, it means your engine was low on oil. You will need to assess where the oil went, but can safely drive the vehicle as long as the oil doesn’t leak out of the engine too quickly.
If the oil light comes back on, shut the engine back down.

, If you add oil and the light comes back on, it means the issue is oil pressure, not the amount of oil. Oil pressure is created by the oil pump forcing the oil through the engine. If the pump fails to function, the engine will not be properly lubricated and running it will cause damage.If the oil light stays on, you will need to have the vehicle towed to your house or a repair facility.
Do not drive the vehicle with the oil light on if at all possible.

Choose your film tint.,
Clean the surface of the taillight.,
Cut the film tint to a rough size.,
Remove the film tint from its protective sheet.,
Apply the film tint to the taillight.,
Use a squeegee to remove any air bubbles.,
Cut away the excess film.,
Tuck in the edges.",How to Tint Tail Lights2," Film tint is a great option for tinting your tail lights, as it allows the light through the tinting, but restricts the light that comes back in. There are many different types of film tint available both online and in car accessory stores.


Depending on the effect you wish to achieve, you can choose a regular black tint, or go for something a little more out there, like yellow, red, gunsmoke or optic blue.You can even find some film tint that's pre-cut to fit certain car models, so if you have a popular type of car, look out for those.

, Before applying the film tint, it is important that your car's tail lights are extremely clean. Use some window cleaner and a microfiber cloth (that won't leave any lint) to get rid of any debris or watermarks.

, Depending on the size of the vinyl sheets, you may want to cut the film tint to an approximate size, so it will be easier to work with. Use a precision knife to do this., Peel the film tint from the protective plastic sheet and spray either some soapy water or a solution of 85% water and 15% rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle on the adhesive side. This will prevent the film from sticking before you have properly aligned it on the taillight., Place the film tint over the taillight. You may need to stretch it to fit the shape of the light, which can be difficult if the light is very curved. Try to get the film tint as smooth as possibly, using your hands to work out any creases.


If you're having difficulty, spray some more solution on the outside of the film and use a heat gun or hair dryer to help stretch out the film and make it more malleable.Just don't hold the heat source too close to the film or apply heat for too long, as this may weaken or shrivel it.

, Use a vinyl squeegee to push any excess water or air bubbles from underneath the film, working from the center outwards. You will need to apply firm pressure to the film to ensure you get the film tint looking as smooth as possible.


If you don't have a squeegee, you can improvise using a credit card or a spatula wrapped in a microfiber towel.You can also continue to use the heat gun or hair dryer at this point to help you to smooth the film.

, Once you are happy with the surface of the film, use a precision knife to cut around the taillight, leaving a little extra film around the perimeter. Be vary careful when doing this, so you don't accidentally cut any of the film covering the taillight.

, The final step is to use the heat gun and the squeegee (though the smaller spatula may be better for this) to stretch and tuck the edges of the film around the edges of the taillight, out of sight. Once the film sets it will hold its position.

Put on the appropriate safety gear.,
Disconnect the battery.,
Use a jack to raise your vehicle, then use jack stands to support it.,
Look for signs of the oil leak.,
Ensure fluids you locate are oil.,
Check the common locations for leaks.,
Replace failed gaskets causing leaks.",How to Respond When Your Car's Oil Light Goes On2," Before you do any kind of work or maintenance on your vehicle, it’s important that you first put on the necessary safety gear. Checking for oil leaks means climbing under the vehicle where oil will likely be dripping from above you, so eye protection is absolutely necessary. You may also choose to wear gloves to protect your hands from pinches, scrapes, or the radiant heat of the engine bay.Eye protection such as glasses or goggles are a requirement for this project.
Gloves are not mandatory but you may choose to wear them.

, Before jacking up the car, pop the hood and disconnect the battery to ensure the engine cannot be started for any reason while you are under the vehicle. Use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the bolt securing the black ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery. The negative terminal can be identified by the letters “NEG” or the negative symbol (-) above the terminal.Remove the ground cable from the negative terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery.
You will not need to remove the cable from the positive terminal.

, Make sure the car is on solid blacktop or concrete and use a jack to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to climb or use a creeper to slide under it. With it at the appropriate height, place jack stands under the car in designated jacking points to support the weight of the vehicle.Never just use a jack to support the weight of a vehicle you climb under.
If you are unsure of where to place the jack or jack stands, check in your vehicle’s owner’s manual for designated jack points.

, Look around the engine from above and below for signs of an oil leak. There may be a small leak that allowed the oil to leak out over time or there may be a more significant leak that happened quickly. Because the oil system is under pressure, a large leak will result in oil being sprayed all over the area of the leak.If you see a small stream of oil running down a surface in the engine bay, follow it up to its highest point to locate the point of the leak.
If there is a lot of oil everywhere, the leak is likely substantial.

, There are a number of different fluids found in the engine of modern vehicles and it can be difficult to determine which fluid you’ve encountered while looking for leaks. Oil is usually brown or black, while coolant tends to be orange or green and windshield washer fluid is usually blue. However, once mixed with the dirt and grime of your engine bay, the color of the fluid may be difficult to assess. Wipe some of the fluid on a blank sheet of white paper to get a better idea of its color.Make sure the engine is cool before starting this process to avoid being burned by dripping fluids.
Look for brown or black fluids when searching for oil leaks.

, When looking for oil leaks, you may want to start at the common gasket failure points. Engines are made up of metal components bolted together, but simply bolting two pieces of metal to each other will not create a seal that can withstand the oil pressure in your engine. Because of this, automakers add gaskets at these locations to create a seal. If a gasket becomes compromised, the pressure of the oil will force the oil out the weak point and create a leak. While these common locations can be a good place to start, this is far from an exhaustive list of places you may find an oil leak.Look at where the oil pan bolts to the bottom of the engine block. The pan is the lowest point in the engine and is held in place by a number of bolts. Run your finger along the oil pan to identify where a leak may have started.
Check the oil drain plug on your oil pan to ensure it is snug and no oil is leaking from it.
Look for signs of oil leaking where the cylinder head meets the block (head gasket) and where the cover bolts to the top of the cylinder head (valve cover).
Leaks may also arise where the crankshaft bolts to the crank pulley on the bottom of the engine block.

, Once you identify the location of an oil leak, you’ll need to take corrective action to stop the leak from continuing. Locate the leak, then remove the component in place over the failed gasket. Scrape off any remnants of the old gasket before replacing it with a new one and bolting the component back into place. Some gaskets are simple and easy to replace, while others may require the removal of the engine from the vehicle. Assess whether or not the repair is something you are capable of doing, as you may need to have a professional mechanic repair the leak.If you can identify the leak, but lack the tools or expertise to repair it, bring it to a mechanic and let them know what you were able to identify.
You can purchase replacement gaskets at your local auto parts store.

Replace the oil filter.,
Do a compression test on the engine.,
Check the oil pressure sending unit.,
Replace the oil pump.",How to Respond When Your Car's Oil Light Goes On3," If you have gone a long time since your last oil change, it’s possible that your oil filter has become too clogged to allow oil to flow through it properly. Address this by draining the oil from the engine, replacing the oil filter, and refilling the engine with new oil. If the old oil filter would not permit oil flow, the light will turn off when you start the engine with a new filter and oil pressure should return to normal.If the oil light does not come back on and the oil pressure gauge reads properly then the issue is resolved.
If the light comes back on, turn the engine off immediately.

, If your engine’s oil was low but there is no sign of a leak, it likely means the engine is burning oil. The engine’s oil should not be able to enter the cylinder to be ignited with the air and fuel mixture, so burning oil means a seal in your engine has been compromised enough to allow oil to seep past it. Two common locations of increased clearance are the valve guides and piston rings. If these have worn enough to allow oil to pass through them, it also will limit the amount of compression the leaking cylinder is capable of.Purchase a compression gauge and insert it into the first cylinder’s spark plug hole to conduct a compression test. Repeat the process with each cylinder.
Have a friend crank the engine as you assess the maximum reading on the gauge.
If one cylinder reads as lower than the others, that cylinder has compromised rings or valve seals. The engine will require significant repairs.

, Locate the oil pressure sending unit and disconnect the wiring giving it power. Look to see if that has any effect on the oil pressure gauge in your vehicle. If it does not, it is likely that the issue is not an actual oil pressure problem, but rather a problem with the sensor reading that pressure.Check in your vehicle’s service manual to locate the oil pressure sending unit, as it may be located in a number of places depending on the make and model of your vehicle.
If the gauge does not move when the sending unit is disconnected, the engine’s oil pressure may actually be fine.

, Oil pumps technically don’t produce oil pressure, but rather they produce flow and it’s the resistance the oil runs into along its path that creates the pressure. With that in mind, a faulty oil pump can reduce the engine’s ability to create oil pressure. If you choose to replace the oil pump yourself, make sure to use the correct gasket or you may create a significant oil leak. Installing a new oil pump can be a big project, so unless you have the tools and expertise, it may be best left to professionals.Use the correct installation tool for your vehicle when seating the oil pickup tube into the pump. Forcing it can cause damage.
Add oil to the pump before you install it to ensure it is properly primed before the engine is started once it’s in place.

Resist the urge to panic.,
Look at your gauges.,
Reduce the power you are using by shutting off consumers that are not needed.,
Keep your engine running.,
Drive to an auto mechanic shop or local parts store.,
Check the battery cables.,
Examine your alternator belt.,
Restart your car after at least five minutes.,
Check with an auto mechanic if all of these steps fail to reveal the true problem.",How to Respond When Your Car's Battery Light Goes On," When your battery light comes on, it sometimes results in a very simple solution.;
, Check the gauge that indicates the vehicle's state of charge, called the voltmeter (be aware that not all cars have this gauge). Often, this gauge has a picture of a battery on it. If it is extremely high or low, it's something to worry about. Normal operating range is 12 to 14 volts. If it is measuring about the same as it always does, you probably don't have a major problem.

, Examples are the radio, fan blower, defroster, dome light. Refrain from using power windows, if possible.

, You may not be able to restart the motor if you turn the car off. If there is an alternator failure you will be running on the car's battery which may last about a half hour. As your car's engine runs, the battery may continue to charge, depending on the failure. Additionally, one of the biggest battery drains is starting your car. By not having to start the engine after shutting it off, you're not using any additional power that might be running low.

, Ask someone to help you test your alternator. If your alternator is fine, ask them to check your battery. The light could be an indicator of a battery going bad or a faulty sensor.

, If they appear corroded or loose, that might be your problem. Clean the cables and the battery terminal with a wire brush. Tighten the cables on your battery terminals.

, If it is loose, tighten it or buy a new one. If it is cracked, buy one immediately. If your alternator belt breaks, your car will not charge.

, On newer cars, this will help your car reset its computer system. After it has reset, the battery light may go off. It may have just been a temporary trigger or sensor. If it returns you, will need to have it looked at by a mechanic.

, Your car's computer system has many sensors and warning indicators. It is likely a computer system issue.

Clean the reflectors and lenses.




Use compressed gas, alcohol, soft rags or big Q-tips to clean heavy dirt accumulated on the auto tail lights.






Use the utmost care to prevent scratches on the reflectors or accidentally removing the plastic's coating.






Soapy water mixed with raw rice can be used to clean the Taillight cluster.






After cleaning rinse with distilled water and allow to dry naturally for 24 hours.






Repaint the reflectors with silver paint to repair scratched reflective coating




Check for moisture. Moisture is one of the main causes of burned halogen auto tail lights. The trapped water vapor inside the light can cause it to explode or even burn out. Moisture inside the light usually indicates faulty seals and gaskets.
Replace crumbling gaskets:




Place a thin layer of silicon sealer in the seating groove.
Mix in a little oil while the silicon is still soft.
Allow this concoction to dry and get hard.




Check the electrical connections that join the bulbs. For a better connection, the spring connections on the bulb base can be moved towards the bulb base to generate more pre-load against the bulb.

Protect your clear coat.",How to Wet Sand a Clear Coat," Use water and a dedicated car washing solution/soap.Follow the bottle’s directions carefully. Your goal is to remove any dirt or grime so that you can focus on the clear coat directly when you sand and buff.;
, Once you have completely cleaned your body, allow it to dry by gently wiping down the surface with a towel.

, Soak for at least 60 minutes in clean water to prevent sharp edges from scratching the clear coat.

, Next soak a rag in water with a little bit of soap. Use about a cap of soap per gallon of water, or as directed by your soap label.

, The size of the section is up to you, but one square foot at a time is usually a good approach; just remember which sections you have done and which you haven’t. This will make the job of sanding the entire car body more manageable. It will also ensure that each part of the surface receives adequate attention.

, Ideally, you’d use a rubber pad as it helps conform to the shape of your panel’s surface., For optimal results, start with the 600-grit sandpaper,and then sand later with the higher-grit paper, such as a 1500-2000-grit paper. Otherwise, go straight to the higher-grit paper.


Use very little pressure.
With your soaked paper in one hand and a wet rag in the other, begin sanding with long strokes all in the direction wind travels across the car: from bumper to windshield, for example.
Sand with one hand, and use your other hand to keep the surface wet with your rag.
Remember to sand evenly. Periodically take a step back to look at your progress and make sure everything looks even.

, After sanding in one direction, cross out the original strokes with a slight diagonal direction. Remember to keep the surface dripping wet, to prevent burning the clear coat.

, If you’ve chosen to begin with 600-grit paper, now is the time to do a second sanding with 1500-grit or 2000-grit paper.

, Your surface should appear very dull after sanding. This is the goal. Buffing will make it shine.

, Experts recommend Dewalt for beginners. B&D Buffmaster is good for more experienced buffers.

, Once you have achieved a desired finish with sanding, you’re ready to start buffing. Be sure to buff at a low RPM of about 1400.


Don’t keep the buffer in one place for more than one or two seconds.
Buff sparingly. Buff the scratches sparingly to prevent a burn. Keep the buffer moving and watch that you don’t overheat the surface.

, If you do, you’ll end up needing to re-sand, or maybe even re-clear the surface.

, Protecting your clear coat should be done on an ongoing basis. Weekly car washing and periodic waxing are the best ways to protect the clear coat.

Buff the wax off with a chamois towel.",How to Remove Emblems From Cars," Emblems or badges can be attached to your vehicle in a few ways. Most emblems are held in place by using a strong adhesive, but some are secured from the inside via a hole in the body of the vehicle. If there is a hole, you will need to have the hole filled by a professional mechanic, then have the entire area of the vehicle repainted.Try referring to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle to see how the emblems are replaced to see how they are fastened.
You can also try using an internet search for your specific car, followed by “shave emblems” or “remove badges” to see pictures of other people removing theirs so see how they are secured.
If the emblems are not secured with adhesive, you will need a professional body shop to remove them.;
, To soften the glue securing the emblem to the vehicle, try pouring hot water directly onto the body of the car just above the emblem itself. The water does not need to be boiling, but should be as hot as possible without risking burning yourself.Microwave a bowl of water for a minute, then pour it onto the body of the car above the badge.
Pour the water above the emblem so it runs along the body and into the glue behind the emblem.

, Instead of hot water, you can also try using an adhesive remover. Spray the adhesive remover onto the body of the car just above the emblem, then spray it around the rest of the edges of the emblem to soften the adhesive on all sides.Adhesive remover can damage the clear coat on the paint, so avoid spraying it too liberally around the vehicle.
Leave the adhesive remover on as you remove the emblems to help eat away at the adhesives.

, You can also loosen the grip of the adhesive by warming it up using a hair dryer. Plug the hair dryer in and set it to the hottest setting. Point the hair dryer directly at the badge and sweep it back and forth along the length of the badge if it’s longer than the nose of the hair dryer.Keep the hair dryer on the emblem for a few minutes, or until the adhesive begins to get tacky.
Check the strength of the adhesive by running a fingernail along the edge of the emblem. If you can press your fingernail into the adhesive, it is warm enough.

, Place a thin plastic wedge against the body of the vehicle directly above, below, or to the side of the emblem. Slide the wedge beneath the badge and into the glue. You may need to do it from multiple angles to loosen the emblem sufficiently. You can then either pry the emblem off, or use another method to cut through the adhesive in the middle.If you pry the emblem off, it may break. If you intend to throw the emblems away after, this method is fine.
If you would like to keep the emblems, try using another method to cut through the glue in the middle.

, Cut a length of fishing line or dental floss that is about eight inches long. Wrap each end around the index fingers on each of your hands, then press the line against the body of the vehicle. Slide it down behind the emblem and pull the line to the left and right in a sawing motion as it passes beneath the emblem and through the adhesive.This method offers the best chances of removing the badge completely intact.
If the dental floss breaks, cut another length of it and repeat the process until you are through.

, Slide the credit card behind the emblem and continue to work it through the softened adhesive until it is loose enough to remove.Make sure to face the credit card out, toward yourself, so the letters don’t scratch the paint.
If you would like to keep the emblem, try to remove as much glue as possible before pulling the emblem off.

, Once the emblem is off of the vehicle, spray adhesive removed on the bits of glue that remain on the body of the car. Allow the adhesive remover to sit for a minute, then wipe the area clean with a rag.You may need to apply adhesive remover more than once to remove all of the glue.

, With all the glue removed, fill a bucket with water and automotive soap. Spray the area with a hose, then wash it thoroughly with a sponge and the soapy water. Once done, rinse the area again.You want to be sure you remove all of the adhesive remover you sprayed onto the paint.
Do this step soon after removing the glue to ensure the adhesive remover doesn’t damage the paint.

, After you washed the area thoroughly, allow it to dry completely. You may speed the process along by using a towel to dry it, but be sure there are no water droplets or moisture left or it can make it take longer to wax.It can take a few hours to dry if you don’t dry it yourself.

, You should never wax a vehicle in direct sunlight, so you may need to move the vehicle so the area you wax the car is under shade. Sunlight can dry the wax to the paint too quickly.Parking the vehicle in a garage is the best way to do this, but if necessary, you can just park it so the area you removed the emblem from is under shade.
Because the area beneath the emblem has no wax and likely limited clear coat on it, you will need to apply wax to protect the paint.

, Use the supplied wax applicator sponge to apply the wax to the area the emblem used to be. Use a circular motion when applying the wax and ensure you cover any part of the paint that the adhesive remover was sprayed onto or may have dripped on. You may choose to wax the entire portion of the car to ensure the wax cover is uniform.
You don’t need to apply too much wax, just a light coat.

, It may take anywhere from thirty minutes to a few hours for the wax to dry completely. Check the dryness of the wax periodically by touching the area with your finger. If the wax rubs off easily under a single finger, it is dry. Many waxes will turn white as they dry, making it easier to determine if it’s ready to be buffed off.

, Once the wax is dry, buff it off of the paint using a chamois towel. Be sure to buff off all of the wax completely. Beneath the wax, the paint will be shiny and protected from the elements. Be sure to use a chamois towel. More abrasive towels can scratch the wax coating you just applied to the paint.
You can apply another coat of wax if the area still isn’t as shiny as the rest of the car.

Allow the area to dry completely.,
Use a buffer and rubbing compound to polish the area.,
Apply a wax to the finished area.",How to Wet Sand a Car," Wet sanding can be an excellent way to restore your paint to its original luster, but it isn’t always the best option. Deep scratches that reach the metal, for instance, often cannot be repaired through wet sanding alone. If the clear coat on the paint has scuffing and scratches, however, wet sanding may be the right solution for you.Scratches that are deep enough to expose metal cannot be resolved through wet sanding alone.
Wet sanding primarily repairs damage to the top layers of paint and clear coat.;
, The damage that you are trying to repair will dictate how much sanding will be required, and with what type of paper. Significant clear coat damage will require multiple steps, but light scuffing can be resolved in one stage.If the damage to the paint is light, skip the 1200 or 1500 grit sandpaper and begin with 2000 or 3000 grit paper instead.
If you are wet sanding a newly painted surface, you can also jump directly to the 2000 or 3000 grit paper.

, When repairing worn, scuffed or scratched paint, begin with a 1200 or 1500 grit sandpaper. You can purchase sandpaper at your local hardware store, large retail store, or auto parts store.Any less than 1200 grit sandpaper may produce scratches that are difficult to buff out.
The higher the grit number on the sandpaper, the finer the abrasive surface.

, Wet sanding requires a lubricant to prevent the sandpaper from burning the paint. Fill a regular bucket with water and a small amount of automotive soap. Do not use an automotive soap that also serves as a wax or a polish.You may also use dish soap for this application.

, Remove the sandpaper from its package and hold it like a sheet of paper, so the longer edges are on the right and left. Use a pair of heavy duty scissors to cut the sandpaper sheets lengthwise to double the number of sheets you have.The width of the cut sheets will wrap around most sand paper squeegees and handles better.
The strips need to be long rather than wide in order to dip half of them in water.

, Place the sandpaper sheets along the edge of the bucket so half of each sheet is soaking in the soapy water. Leave them to soak for five minutes or so.The halves that are soaking in the water should be completely saturated with soapy water before moving on.
The dry portion will allow you to attach the sandpaper securely to your tool of choice.

, Before you begin wet sanding, be sure you remove any debris or film from the area you will be working on. Use a regular automotive soap and a sponge to wash it, then rinse it thoroughly with a hose.Do not use an automotive soap that is also a polish or a wax.
You will not need to wait for the area to dry to move on.

, Do not simply use your hands when wet sanding. The gaps between your fingers will create an uneven sanding surface, resulting in an inconsistent finish. Instead, wrap the sandpaper around a pad, handle or sandpaper squeegee based on your preference.Depending on the area you are wet sanding, there are flat, curved, and bendable handles you can choose from.
Read the instructions on the tool you opt to purchase to see how to secure the paper to it.
You can buy sanding tools at most hardware and auto parts stores.

, With the sandpaper thoroughly soaked, begin sanding the area with small circular motions and a light amount of pressure. If your sanding does not seem to be affecting the clear coat, apply a little more pressure so it will. Do not press hard enough to create scratches in the paint itself.It may take a little practice to determine just how much pressure you need to apply to the sandpaper.
Ease off of the sandpaper if it appears to be penetrating beyond the clear coat or damaging the paint.

, Switch the direction of your circular motions from time to time or approach the area from a different angle. This will ensure you sand the entire surface evenly.Uneven sanding can be difficult to identify while you work, but may be apparent in the final product.
Be careful not to increase pressure when changing angles or directions.
The color in the paint should bleed into the water and tint it slightly. If the water gets any darker, you are sanding too hard.

, Do not allow the sandpaper to become dry while wet sanding. Keep the area heavily saturated with soapy water throughout the process by dipping the sandpaper in the bucket often and even pouring some of the soapy water on the vehicle.As the sandpaper gets dry, it will produce heat which can burn the paint.
If you burn the paint, you may need to have that component of the body repainted.
Swap sheets of sandpaper out for new soaked ones as they sandpaper becomes worn out or too soggy to use.

, As you sand, you will likely feel a fair amount of fatigue in your hands and arms. When you get tired, you increase the chances that you will accidentally use the edge of the tool as opposed to keeping it flat on the vehicle. Take frequent breaks to combat fatigue.
Be careful not to scratch the paint with the handle of the tool or one of the edges the sandpaper is wrapped around.

, Once you have completely wet sanded the area with your 1200 or 1500 grit sandpaper, repeat the process with 2000 or 3000 grit paper. This will remove any shallow scratches or abrasions left by the first stage of wet sanding.If the damage you are trying to repair is light, you can do only this step.
Remember to keep the area completely wet as you sand with this paper.

, Once you have completed the wet sanding, use a hose to rinse off any soap or debris left on the vehicle. Be sure you rinse it thoroughly because you will need to apply a glaze or wax to the area once it dries.Touch the area with your hand to ensure there is no soapy residue left behind.

, The wet sanded area will need to be completely dry in order to buff properly. Do not allow the area to sit in direct sunlight, as it may damage or fade the paint. Instead, leave it to dry for a few hours in a shady area.You can use a towel to dry the area, but allow any remaining moisture to air dry completely before moving forward.
You may use a hair dryer or other heat source to expedite the drying.

, Once the wet sanded area is completely dry, apply some rubbing compound to a buffer pad and use a power buffer to polish the area. Use a medium speed and a light amount of pressure when buffing the rubbing compound into the paint.With the buffer running, rotate it in circles as it spins.
Applying too much pressure can burn the paint, so start light and apply more pressure if need be to rub in the compound.

, Once the area has been buffed, it should look like the finished product. Use a high quality automotive wax on the area to provide an additional layer or protection. Wet sanding can make that area of the paint slightly more shallow than the rest of the vehicle, so a layer of wax can help prevent it from fading at a different rate than the rest of the paint.You may want to wash and wax the entire vehicle to ensure no dust or debris from the wet sanding remains on the vehicle when you’re done.

Waxing the car will protect the paint and create a more brilliant shine.

Fill a bucket with vinegar and water.,
Grab a microfiber cloth.,
Saturate your cloth and apply a liberal amount to the windows.,
Dry the windows immediately after washing them.",How to Take Water Marks Off Vehicles1," Using an equal amount of each or 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar, fill a tub with enough water to wash your windows. If your watermarks are particularly bad, you will want to do the stronger of the two vinegar solutions.Some water spots may appear to have disappeared, but return after you dry your windows. If this is the case, bump up your vinegar solution to half water and half vinegar or even straight vinegar.;
, Microfiber cloths are wonderful for cleaning windows, as they do not leave any fibers behind. When you are cleaning watermarks, it is extremely important to leave as little residue as possible., Soak your cloth completely in your vinegar solution and immediately place it on your windows, washing in a circular motion. You may need to pay special attention to any areas with a lot of staining or thick, calcified deposits.

, Once you have finished washing your windows, immediately dry them with a clean, microfiber rag. If you notice any lingering spots, go over the area again, putting a little bit more elbow grease into your movements.

Do not worry about rinsing your windows before drying, as vinegar can be wiped directly from the glass.
Skipping this step could result in further water calcification. Always thoroughly dry your windows after washing.

"
"
Clean and dry your vehicle as usual.,
Identify the areas in need of calcification removal.,
Purchase a clay bar.,
Move the clay over the surface of the car containing the stains.,
Check the area you’ve used the clay on.,
Go back over any remaining mineral deposits.,
Finish up with a wax.",How to Take Water Marks Off Vehicles2," Before you begin removing surface water spots, you need to make sure your vehicle is clean and free of dirt and debris. The solutions for water stain removal will not work if the vehicle is dirty or damp.


Different brands may require further instructions for washing or waxing, so make sure you check your solution’s bottle to be sure.

, It is highly unlikely that your entire vehicle will need to be gone over for water staining, so identify the areas that need the greatest amount of help and start there. You can go back over any smaller problem areas after you’ve finished.Treating your entire car for spots is not usually necessary. Completing the most difficult areas first allows you to expend the bulk of your energy on difficult spots.

, A clay bar is a putty made of clay that is gentle enough to work on paint without stripping it, but strong enough to encourage calcification to adhere to the clay. This method carefully and gently pulls mineral deposits away from the paint without harming it.Clay bars are available at some hardware stores and most auto specialty stores.
There are many different brands of clay bars. Some come in a pre-made bar, while others have to be mixed with water. Check your bar’s package instructions.

, For the clay to work, it has to be able to grip the mineral deposits on the surface of your paint. Run it over the areas of your car with water staining to lift the stains.

If the water spots are tough, you may have to use more of a dabbing motion.

, Once you’ve gone over your paint, run your hand over the area to make sure there aren’t any watermarks remaining on the surface of the paint. Make a note of any problematic areas., If you encounter some rough spots or bumps, use your clay on the areas again, continuing to use gentle movements. If pieces were not picked up initially, dab and pull the bar away to encourage the stains to lift., Because the clay you are using can strip wax and some of the top layers of finish away, you will need to finish up your cleaning session with a wax to protect your paint."
"
Wash and dry your vehicle thoroughly.,
Clean the damaged areas with a scratch cleaner.,
Buff the car using a machine buffer and vehicle polish.,
Wipe the car down to remove any buildup.,
Apply a coat of wax.",How to Take Water Marks Off Vehicles3," As with surface spots, you must make sure your car is thoroughly cleaned and dried before you will be able to reach the deep staining. Leaving any residue behind could actually do more damage to the paint.

, Deep staining is caused by mineral deposits eating away the paint, so the surrounding areas may have some small scratches or abrasions. Clean up the area around the pitting with a scratch cleaner to make sure the car will shine.Scratch cleaners are available in the auto section of supermarkets, as well as through auto specialty stores and online.
Removing scratches will make sure the resulting finish is even and smooth.

, To get down deep to the source of the stain, you will need to buff your vehicle with a machine buffer and a vehicle polish designed for water spots. Doing so will provide a gentle abrasive movement on your vehicle, stripping away small layers of paint until the divot is no longer detectable.If you do not have a buffer, check with your local auto store. Some stores have rental options available.
Inexpensive buffers (think under $50) may also be purchased to have on hand in the future.

, After you’ve polished your car, wipe down the polished areas to remove any lingering paint, varnish, or minerals. This should be done with a gentle cloth such as microfiber, rather than terrycloth, as terrycloth could further damage the paint.

Although you can do this with water, using a microfiber cloth should ensure that you pick up all of the dirt and residue.
If you do use water to go over the area, make sure you dry it before moving on to the next step.

, Finish up by applying a coat of wax to protect your vehicle from damage down the road. Because buffing actually removes small layers of paint to create an even surface, failing to wax may leave delicate areas of your vehicle exposed."

Warm up the engine.,
Locate a vacuum line.,
Disconnect the hose.,
Slowly pour Seafoam into the vacuum hose.,
Rev the engine simultaneously.While you pour the Seafoam into the vacuum hose, a second person should rev the engine up to 2000 RPM.,
Let the engine sit.,
Drive until the smoke clears.",How to Use Seafoam1," Park the car in a well-ventilated area and start the engine. Let the engine warm to operating temperatures.


You must do this while the car is in a well-ventilated area since the process will usually create a lot of smoke.
Vehicles with automatic transmission should be kept in park. Vehicles with manual transmissions should be put into neutral, and the parking brake should be applied throughout the process.;
, Open the hood of the car and locate a vacuum line that distributes evenly to all cylinders of the engine.


On most vehicles, the best option will be the vacuum line from the brake booster PCV.
Since different vehicles are set up in different ways, you may need to choose a different option. If in doubt, seek a professional opinion before attempting this method.

, Carefully disconnect one end of the selected vacuum hose.


If using the brake booster hose, disconnect the hose going to the manifold. The check valve should remain on the hose going to the brake booster, and you should not allow Seafoam to pass through the check valve during this process.

, Carefully pour one-third to one-half of the bottle directly into the detached hose.If necessary, position a funnel in the opening of the hose and pour the Seafoam in through that.
The manufacturer recommends against the practice of drawing Seafoam into the hose using suction.

,


You will probably see heavy white smoke coming out of the tailpipe. This is normal and should not be cause for alarm.

, As soon as you finish pouring Seafoam into the vacuum hose, turn off the engine and allow the car to sit for 10 to 30 minutes.


The longer you wait, the deeper the Seafoam will sink into the engine. Regularly maintained engines may only need a 10-minute wait, but for engines with a lot of suspected buildup, a full 30-minute wait would be better.

, Start the vehicle again and drive aggressively for five to ten minutes, or until your tailpipe stops pumping out heavy white smoke.


Drive legally. If possible, go on a road where you can reach speeds up to 60 MPH (97 km/h). This is best done at night or during another time when traffic won't be an issue since your tailpipe will produce a lot of smoke.
Once the smoke stops, the engine is clean and the process is complete.

Wash your car as soon as possible.,
Spray off your car with clean water.,
Rub the surface with a microfiber rag covered in hot, soapy water.,
Rinse the surface repeatedly.,
Dry and wax the surface of your car once the sap is removed.",How to Remove Tree Sap From Your Car1," The longer tree sap or any substances like sap (and bird droppings or insect remains for that matter) are left on the surface of the vehicle, the more difficult they are to remove. Acting fast will require the least amount of effort and the most success at getting a sparkling car exterior.;
, Giving your car this initial rinse will get all the large debris off but it will also help you to see where you need to focus further cleaning.


Take the time to wash your whole car, even if it's not all covered in sap. You will be more satisfied when you get the sap off if your whole car is nice and clean. Besides, you already have all the supplies out and ready to go.

, Use the hottest water you can, as the sap will be weakened most effectively by really hot water.


Before using other methods of sap removal, try cleaning your car with really hot water. If the sap gets removed, then great, you are done. If the sap remains, at least you have a clean surface on which to try other methods.
Be sure that your rag is clean and that you rinse it often to get any debris and sap out. Using a dirty rag will only spread this across the surface of your car.

, Rinsing the area you are cleaning will allow you to see if your job is done or if you need to use more elbow grease to get the sap removed.

, All the cleaning you have done has effectively removed the sap but it has probably also removed any wax that was protecting the surface. Use your usual method of waxing your car or, if you have never waxed your car before, consult How to Wax You Car for directions.

Figure out how much Seafoam you'll need.,
Fill the gas tank.,
Pour the Seafoam into the fuel tank.,
Drive the vehicle.",How to Use Seafoam2," Find out how many gallons of fuel your vehicle's fuel tank holds. For each 1 gallon (4 L) of fuel, you will need to add 1 oz (30 ml) of Seafoam.Adding Seafoam directly to the fuel tank will provide a variety of benefits. It can clean deposits left behind in the fuel injectors, thereby making your vehicle run more smoothly. It can also control moisture buildup in the fuel, stabilize the fuel, and lubricate the upper cylinders.

, Go to the gas station and fill the vehicle's gas tank with octane gasoline.


When filling the tank, make sure that you leave enough room in the tank to add the calculated amount of Seafoam afterward.
While Seafoam can technically be used with any octane gas, it is recommended that you use it with 91 octane or higher. Fuel with a higher octane number requires a greater amount of heat and compression to ignite, leading to improved performance. The Seafoam can provide a greater benefit to the vehicle under these conditions, as well.

, Place a long-neck funnel in the fuel tank and pour your calculated amount of Seafoam directly into the fuel tank.Pour the product slowly to avoid spills.
Using a funnel will also help prevent spills. Due to the design of the bottle and the position of the fuel tank opening, it is nearly impossible to pour Seafoam directly from the bottle and into the fuel tank without the use of a funnel.

, Put the fuel tank cap back on and drive your car at a steady pace for at least five to ten minutes.


As you drive, the Seafoam should mix into the gasoline, improving the quality of the gasoline and cleaning the fuel injectors at the same time.
Try to run this tank of gasoline until the vehicle is nearly empty to maximize the effectiveness of the Seafoam.
After completing this step, the process is complete.

Calculate the correct amount of Seafoam.,
Keep the engine cold.,
Pour Seafoam into the carburetor throat.,
Drive the vehicle as many as 250 miles (402 km).",How to Use Seafoam3," You will need to use 2 oz (60 ml) of Seafoam for every 1 gallon (4 L) of petroleum oil.You'll be adding the Seafoam directly to the oil in your vehicle. Since Seafoam is made of petroleum, it is safe to mix into the oil and should not cause any damage to the vehicle.
When used in this manner, Seafoam will re-liquify old fuel and deposits, clearing out the carburetor bowl and jets in the process.

, Switch off the engine, if it is presently running, and allow the engine to completely cool down before continuing.


Adding room temperature Seafoam to burning hot oil can shock the carburetor valve springs and damage your vehicle.

, Remove the cap from the engine oil spout and pour the calculated amount of Seafoam directly into the carburetor throat.


Consider using a funnel to pour in the Seafoam. Doing so is not strictly necessary, but funnels can help reduce the threat of accidental spills.

, Cap the carburetor throat, close the hood of the car, and drive the vehicle as usual for as many as 250 miles (402 km).


You should get the oil changed once you have driven a distance between 100 and 250 miles (160 and 402 km). Seafoam is a potent additive, so the oil filter can struggle and the quality of the oil can degrade after this distance.
After driving the car and changing the oil, the process is complete.

Wash your car with soap and hot water.,
Buy commercial tree sap remover and review the instructions on the container.,
Place some of the remover on a clean rag.,
Rub in a circular motion over the sap to lift it from the surface.,
Finish by washing and waxing your car.Rewashing you car will help remove any residue left over from the sap or the cleaner used to remove it.",How to Remove Tree Sap From Your Car2," Make sure to get all the dirt and grime off the surface around the sap. If attempting to get the sap off with the hot water and soap doesn't work, continue with these steps.


Even if the wash doesn't get the sap off, the warmth of the water will begin to soften it, making it easier to remove. This is also helpful if the sap has been on the car for a while.

, This should be available at any auto-parts store. Using this type of product is a highly recommended way to remove sap from your car because it is formulated to dissolve sap effectively without hurting your car's exterior.

, Then hold the rag on the sap while gently applying pressure for a minute or so. The remover should soak into the sap, breaking down the connection between the sap and your car's surface., Be relatively gentle while doing this, as you don't want to spread any of the sap across the surface of your car.

, A new coating of wax is recommended to renew the protective coating on the vehicle, making sure your car has a beautiful, shiny surface.

Try mineral spirits or alcohol wipes. Mineral spirits applied lightly with a soft cloth will break down the sap and remove it but it has the potential of damaging your car's surface. Do not rub too vigorously or for too long so that the paint job is not damaged.
Mineral spirits and alcohol wipes should be tried separately. Use the previous directions and try with mineral spirits. If that fails, use readily available 91% isopropyl alcohol instead of mineral spirits. Alcohol evaporates quickly and although your cloth will seem wet, it is the water that is left after the alcohol evaporates. Keep your cloth wet with fresh alcohol and move quickly with light pressure. This will easily remove hard dried as well as fresh pine tree sap.
Spray WD-40 on the tree sap.The sap will begin to absorb the solvent. Let it sit for a few minutes. You can use your rag to lift the loosened sap from the car.
Rub hand sanitizer on the tree sap. Place a small amount of hand sanitizer on the sap and let it set for a few minutes. Rub with a clean cloth and the sap dissolves right off., The car wash will help remove any residue left over from the sap or the cleaner used to remove it. Any solution that would deteriorate paint will be washed away. A new coating of wax is recommended to renew the protective coating on the vehicle.

Look at the letter/number combination on the tire.,
Look at the three-digit numeric portion.,
Look at the two-digit number following the Section Width number.,
Look at the letter following the numbers -- it identifies the tire's internal construction.,
Look for the Speed Rating.,
Consider the Tire and Wheel Diameter.",How to Tell the Size Difference on a Car Tire," Most tire sizes begin with a letter or letters that identify the type of vehicle and/or type of service for which they were designed. The common indicators are as follows:


P225/50R16 91S

P = When a tire size begins with a ""P,"" it signifies the tire is a ""P-metric"" size that was designed to be fitted on vehicles that are primarily used as passenger vehicles. This includes cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and light duty pickup trucks (typically 1/4- and 1/2-ton load capacity). The use of P-metric sizes began in the late 1970s and they are the most frequently used type of tire size today.
/50R16 92S = If there isn't a letter preceding the three-digit numeric portion of a tire size, it signifies the tire is a ""Metric"" size (also called ""Euro-metric"" because these sizes originated in Europe). While Metric tire sizes are primarily used on European cars, they are also used on vans and sport utility vehicles. Euro-metric sizes are dimensionally equivalent to P-metric sizes, but typically differ subtly in load carrying capabilities.


T125/90D16 98M

T = If a tire size begins with a ""T,"" it signifies the tire is a ""Temporary Spare"" (""space saver"" or ""mini spare"") that was designed to be used temporarily only until a flat tire can be repaired or replaced.


LT245/75R16 108/104S

LT = If a tire size begins with ""LT,"" it signifies the tire is a ""Light Truck-metric"" size that was designed to be used on vehicles that are capable of carrying heavy cargo or towing large trailers. This includes medium and heavy-duty (typically 3/4- and 1-ton load capacity) pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and full-size vans. Tires branded with the ""LT"" designation are the ""little brothers"" of 18-wheel tractor-trailer tires and are designed to provide substantial reserve capacity to accept the additional stresses of carrying heavy cargo.


50R16LT 112/107Q, 8.75R16.5LT 104/100Q or 31x10.50R15LT 109Q

LT = If a tire ends with ""LT,"" it signifies the tire is either an earlier ""Numeric"", ""Wide Base"" or ""Flotation"" Light Truck size designed to be used on vehicles that are capable of carrying heavy cargo and towing trailers (Numeric sizes), use 16.5-inch diameter rims (Wide Base sizes) or are wider, oversized tires designed to help the vehicle drive on top of loose dirt or sandy surfaces (Flotation sizes). This includes light, medium and heavy-duty (typically 1/2-, 3/4 and 1-ton load capacity) pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Tires branded with the ""LT"" at the end of their size designation are also the ""little brothers"" of 18-wheel tractor-trailer tires and are designed to provide substantial reserve capacity to accept the additional stresses of carrying heavy cargo.


/70R15C 104/102R

C = If a Euro-metric sized tire ends with a ""C,"" it signifies the tire is a ""Commercial"" tire intended to be used on vans or delivery trucks that are capable of carrying heavy loads. In addition to being branded with the ""C"" in their size, these tires are also branded with their appropriate Service Description and ""Load Range"" (Load Range B, Load Range C or Load Range D).


ST225/75R15

ST = If a tire size begins with ""ST,"" it signifies the tire is a ""Special Trailer Service"" size that was designed to only be used on boat, car or utility trailers. ST-sized tires should never be used on cars, vans or light trucks.

;
, This identifies the tire's Section Width (cross section) in millimeters.


P225/50R16 91S. The 225 indicates this tire is 225 millimeters across from the widest point of its outer sidewall to the widest point of its inner sidewall when mounted and measured on a specified width wheel. This measurement is also referred to as the tire's section width. Because many people think of measurements in inches, the 225mm can be converted to inches by dividing the section width in millimeters by 25.4 (the number of millimeters per inch). mm / 25.4 = 8.86""

, This is the Sidewall Aspect Ratio.


P225/50R16 91S. The 50 indicates that this tire size's sidewall height (from rim to tread) is 50% of its section width. The measurement is the tire's section height, and also referred to as the tire's series, profile or aspect ratio. The higher the number, the taller the sidewall; the lower the number, the lower the sidewall. We know that this tire size's section width is 225mm and that its section height is 50% of 225mm. By converting the 225mm to inches (225 / 25.4 = 8.86"") and multiplying it by 50% (.50) we confirm that this tire size results in a tire section height of 4.43"". If this tire were a P225/70R16 size, our calculation would confirm that the size would result in a section height of 6.20"", approximately a 1.8-inch taller sidewall.

,


P225/50R16, P225/50ZR16. The R in the P225/50R16 91S size identifies that the tire has a Radial construction in which the tire's body plies ""radiate"" out from the imaginary center of the wheel. Radial tires are by far the most popular type of tire today representing over 98% of all tires sold.
If the R in the size was replaced with a D (225/50D16), it would identify that the internal tire body plies crisscross on a Diagonal and that the tire has a ""bias ply"" construction. Tires using this construction are for light truck and spare tire applications.
If the R in the size was replaced with a B (225/50B16), it would identify that the tire body plies not only crisscross the tire on a diagonal as before, but that they are reinforced with belts under the tread area. This type of tire construction is called ""Belted."" Tires using this construction are practically extinct.

, Today, the only tires that continue to include the speed rating ""in"" the tire size (P225/50ZR16) are Z-speed rated tires. In this case, following the two digits used to identify the aspect ratio are the letters ZR to identify the tire's speed rating (Z) and its internal construction (R). Since 1991, all other speed ratings are identified in the tire's Service Description (which will be covered shortly).

,


P225/50R16 91S. The 16 indicates the tire and wheel diameter designed to be matched together.
Tires that have a rim diameter expressed in inches (P225/50R16, as well as 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26 and 28) are called ""inch rim"" sizes, are the most common type of tire size and are used on most cars, minivans, vans, sport utility vehicles and light duty light trucks. While not as common, two additional ""unique"" types of tire/wheel diameters are still in use today.

Tires and wheels that have a rim diameter expressed in ""half"" inches (8.00R16.5LT, as well as, 14.5, 15.5, 17.5 and 19.5) are used on some heavy-duty trailers, heavy-duty light trucks and box vans.
Tires and wheels that have a rim diameter expressed in millimeters (190/65R390, as well as, 365 and 415) are called millimetric sizes. Michelin initiated millimetric sizes for their TRX tires that saw limited use on many different car models in the late 1970s and 1980s.
Michelin PAX System run flat tires have been introduced as an integrated wheel/tire system on a very limited basis as Original Equipment (O.E.) in North America. An example PAX System size of 235/710R460A 104T expresses tire and wheel dimensions in millimeters (235 mm Section Width, tire Overall Diameter of 710 mm and a 460A mm rim diameter, with the ""A"" in 460A signifying these tires feature ""asymmetric"" beads in which the outside bead (450 mm) and inside bead (470 mm) are actually different diameters.
All of these ""unique"" tire/wheel diameters were developed specifically because the tire and wheel design or intended vehicle use required them to be different than conventional tires and wheels. All of these tires and wheels feature bead profiles that have a different shape than traditional ""inch rim"" sizes.

Get a front end alignment.",How to Replace Tie Rod Ends," This should be done with a tire iron or impact wrench. While on the ground the car’s weight will keep the wheels from turning. This way you can safely loosen the lug nuts.;
, Refer to your service manual for jacking points and jack up your car. Stabilize the vehicle with jack stands and chock the rear tires. It is not safe to leave the vehicle suspended on the jack alone.

, Finish taking the lug nuts off of the wheel and remove it from the wheelbase. Slide the wheel under the car. This provides an extra safety measure in case the jack stands fail.

, When you remove the wheel, you will be able to see the steering knuckle. There will be a shaft going through this knuckle with a castle nut on the bottom and a round head on top. This is the outer tie rod.

, Cars often have an inner tie rod end as well. Start by locating the outer tie rod end. Follow the outer tie rod end underneath the car until it meets the inner tie rod end.

, This nut holds the outer tie rod end in place and prevents it from moving along the spindle of the inner tie rod end. Loosening it will allow you to twist the outer tie rod end. By design, the outer tie rod end must be twisted off from the inner tie rod end., This will mark the location of your outer tie rod end and you will know how far to thread on the replacement. Do not tighten the pinch nut. If you do, you will not be able to easily turn the outer tie rod end., This pin will be located where the tie rod end meets the steering knuckle. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to straighten out the pin and then pull it out. Throw the cotter pin away. It should not be reused., This is the nut that the cotter pin went through. It holds the tie rod end to the steering knuckle. Removing it will allow you to remove the outer tie rod end., To do this, you can use a tie rod puller or a ball joint separator.


Insert the tool between the ball joint of the outer tie rod end and the steering knuckle.
Use it to pry the shaft out of the steering knuckle.

, To do this, you will twist the outer tie rod end off of the spindle of the inner tie rod end. Turn it counterclockwise to loosen. Remember to count exactly how many turns it takes you so that you can tighten the replacement the same number of turns. This helps keep your alignment as close as possible., Only do this if you are replacing both inner and outer tie rod ends. You will need to remove the pinch nut. Next, take a pair of pliers and remove the clamp from the boot on the inside end of the inner tie rod end. There is another clip on the far side of the boot that you will have to break with a flat head screwdriver. Insert the screwdriver and twist to break it. Now you can slide the boot off., To do this, you will need a large, deep socket that fits over the inner tie rod end. Twist the inner tie rod end counterclockwise until it is loose. Pull it off of the car.


If you can gain access to the inner tie rod end, this can possibly be done with a wrench, if necessary.
You can get an adaptor that fits over the inner tie rod end and makes it easier to fit a socket onto the inner tie rod., If there is any doubt that the new tie rod end is compatible with your vehicle, do not use it until you consult a mechanic. They should be approximately the same shape and size. If they are exactly the same length that is even better., This should be done with the same socket or wrench as before. However, you do need to check your owner’s manual or service manual to find the proper torque value. Use a torque wrench to ensure that you twist the inner tie rod end to the correct torque values., You will have to replace the clip that you broke, as they are a one time use only. It is ideal to have one before you start the job. Once you slide the boot up the inner tie rod end and into place, fasten the new clip. Then use the pliers to refasten the second clip on the boot.There is a vent port on the boot that must be lined up with a tube on the steering gear., This must be done before you try to put the outer tie rod end on. Take the pinch nut far enough up the shaft so that it will not interfere with the outer tie rod end being put on.

, You should thread it by hand exactly the same number of turns that it took to take it off. Then thread the pinch nut up to the outer tie rod end. Tighten the pinch nut to keep the outer tie rod end from moving., The shaft of the tie rod end will fit down through the knuckle just as the old tie rod end did. You can move the knuckle and the tie rod end as needed to get them to align properly., This will secure the tie rod end to the steering knuckle. Check your owner’s manual or service manual for exact torque specifications for this bolt., Make sure that the castle nut aligns with the hole in the tie rod end shaft. Slide the cotter pin through the hole and bend the ends back to wrap it around the castle nut. This prevents driving vibrations from loosening the castle nut.Always be sure to install a new cotter pin. Do not reuse the old pen.

, Some tie rod ends come with a grease fitting that simply screws into the top of the tie rod end. If this is the case for you, install it now.

, This is only necessary if your tie rod ends come with a grease fitting. Apply grease until it is visible on the outside of the tie rod end with a grease gun. You should put use enough grease that you see it on the outside of the tie rod end., This will prevent damage to the brakes and rotors., Use an open end wrench to tighten the pinch nut as tight as you can against the tie rod end. This will ensure that your vehicle is as close as possible to being back in alignment., Tighten the lugs by hand in a star pattern.

, Use the floor jack to lift the car off of the jack stands and then lower it to the ground slowly.

, Use a lug wrench or impact to tighten the lug nuts to the specified torque. Again, tighten in a star pattern.

, If you need to replace both sides, the process is the same.

, Now that you have altered parts steering system, you will need to have your front end aligned by a professional to avoid uneven wear and tear."
